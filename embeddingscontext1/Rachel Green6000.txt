Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Where can I wash up?
Okay.
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
Split it?
Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
I knew.
What?
Wow.
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
Me.
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Yeah.
God, he's good.
If only he were a woman.
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Hi!
Alright.
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Hey.
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
God!
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
Hey!
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
Joey, no means no!
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
Oh!
Barry?!
I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.
We have got to start locking that door!
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
No!
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?
No, I'm just....
What?!
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
No.
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Ten dollars an hour.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
Yeah!
I think it's romantic.
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
Oh.
What's goin' on?
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
Hi.
Hey.
Hi, Geoffrey.
Ah here, we brought wine.
Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
Wow!
You didn't break up with that fireman?
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Ross!
Ross.
Oh, forget it, okay?
What? What?
Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
I know.
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
Oh you are so lucky.
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
Well maybe he was nervous.
Really?
You don't.
Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Mmmm.
You do?
Hey.
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Hey.
What're you guys doing out here?
Okay!
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Ross.
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
Ross.
Okay?
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
Right.
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
No. Why?
Joey!
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
No.
They know you know.
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Yes!
Uh.... bean! Bean!
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
That, you get? That, you get?
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
Why?
No.
I don't think so.
Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
What?
Yeah?
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
Ohh!
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
She said she'd call me.
Oh God.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
OK.
Yeah right.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
You don't.
Y'know?
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Hey!
You practice losing the Grammies too?
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Uh-huh.
Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.
Here we go.
You're not going?
Uh-huh.
Monica.
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
Honey, I'm just checking.
Phoebe!
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Really?!
Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
What?
Oh well, where is he?!
She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?
Ross?
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
I'm here.
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
I do.
I can't believe this is happening.
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
That's who.
Look, are you gonna be ok?
Hello?
Cut!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Hello, is Ross there?
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Ugh!
Phoebe?
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Monica!
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
Hmm?
Did-did you take these back?
Right.
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
Thank you.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Sorry.
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Fine.
Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
Y'know...
Chandler!
So, will I like any of these guys?
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
You work with robots!!
Rachel.
Hey!
Hi .
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
I know!
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?
Op.
Joey.
No. Now maybe.
C'mon.
Open up. We want to talk to you.
I don't feel like talkin.
Ow!
Oh-ow!
All right.
Look...
Ow!
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
It's that terrible?
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Great!
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Yeah, what town are we near?
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Ok.
Almost never.
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Anytime you're ready.
Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Fine.
Fine.
Fine.
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Chandler!
Wow.
Okay..
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
What?
Huh.
Ahhhh!
See?
Would you like some gum?
Um, is it sugarless?
Joshua.
Oh, hmm.
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy...
Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
Yeah, I...
Oh...
Ohhhh
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
You ok?
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
Right?
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
John Glenn is here?!
Sure.
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Bye.
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
Yeah, sure.
Look!
Oh no! No! No! No!
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Dude! That's my sister!
Give me that!
Pheebs!
Hey Phoebe!
Hi Pheebs!
Fine!
Phoebe, what's the matter?
Pheebs?
Well then we'll get wet.
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
Yeah?
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Right!
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
Third door on the left.
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
Hey.
Thanks!
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
Uh... yay!
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
Hello!
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
That would be great. Thank you.
Oh, hi. It's Mark.
Oh.
Hello.
Yeah.
Hello.
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure. What's up?
Joey?
Awwww.
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
Yeah.
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Why?!
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
Because I-I like you.
You like me?
I'm sorry.
More so than anything else.
I-I-I found it interesting.
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Fine!
I know! I know! I know!
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Fine!
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Ha!
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Nooo!
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Get out!
Please!
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Ohhh!
Yeah!
Oh my God!-Eh! Well...
Why are we in bed together?
I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Well...
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
No. I...
Chandler!!
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Noo!
Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
Good.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Good.
And ya know what, now I've got closure.
Try the bottom one.
Hmm.
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Julie.
What up?!
Everyone, this is Julie.
Ohh. Hi!
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
Mon?
Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
Sorry.
Mon?
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
No?
I think I know that girl.
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
Oh!
Ohh...
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
That sounds perfect!
Yeah.
See?
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
I'm listening.
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
He broke that.
Thanks.
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
Not a problem.
And now for the great news.
What, that wasn't the great news?
Ugh.
You okay?
Yeah! I got my girls.
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
What?
What?!!
I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Excuse me, there was no time!
Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
You what?
What?! She made the tea!
Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
Oh my God!
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Oh right.
Oh, okay!
Morning!
Yeah.
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Oh that.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
Oh, sorry.
What?
You missed the exit!
My God, what were you thinking about?
Um, Barry.
Bye!
Okay!
Thanks.
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
Marcel?
Oh gosh.
Marcel?
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Ross, you don't know that.
Nothing!
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Oh!!
What? What?!
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
That's pretty much it.
Ohh.
Your parents'?
Yeah, they're out of town.
Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
Yeah that works.
Phoebe?
No! Help me!
I can't! I have to work!
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Ugh!
Really!
Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
Um-hmm.
Eh. Beth dies.
Beth, Beth dies?
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
Yeah...
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Hey!
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?
Oh God.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
I did!
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
I'm okay.
Yeah.
How're you doing?
Ooh, that bad, huh?
What?
You know.
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
You're right.
I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
Thank you. So are we good?
Daddy.
Surprise.
Happy birthday sweetpea.
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
Well, we could count again.
Good!
Yeah.
I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
I know, why not?
Right!
Huh?
Another good point.
No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Why isn't it working out?
Joey...
All right, then you owe me $350.
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
What's the part, Anti-man?
Noo.
What's the matter with you?
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
You're kiddin'.
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
Nothing.
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Nothing.
I am... free!
Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
Okay...
Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
What's up, Ross?
So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
So?
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Who?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Yay!
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Well that I can believe.
Hey! Is the show still on?
Almost over man.
Yes!!
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
The Luisa from home room!
You have no idea who I am, do you.
No, none at all.
Yeah, what?
So, what do you think?
About what?
What?
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
I did.
I knew.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Yeah, maybe...
Oh, God.
Grape.
OK, now, sit. OK.
Sorry.
Ah, so what are we looking at?
Oh great!
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
Oh, sorry!
Okay. Okay.
What?!
I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
Stop saying that. I hate that.
Uh, Ross?
I don't!
Career counselor?
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
I know...
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Yeah, that's a big step.
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
Oh, great!
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
That was unbelievable!
I care!
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
Oh, who cares?
And so do I.
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Ahh.
Ohh, it was the best!
I think the check in is that way.
Hello! Ohh, kids love me.
Hey!
And?
What?!
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Because!
Well, you should have.
Why?
Why?
Because!
Exactly!
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
You mean a backup?
Yeah, yeah I got that.
You do?
Exactly.
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
Ross?
Hey roomies!
Great.
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
All right, thank you so much for all your help.
Sure.
Hm-mmm.
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Jill?
Ross, wants a pajmena?
It's a rug.
I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry...
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Mindy.
Don't you have to pee?
'S'why I'm dancing...
Hey, you.
Hey, you.... So, what's up?
No!!
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Thank you Phoebe.
Oh?
I know!
Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Ohhh...
It'll be a short one.
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Too?
Okay..
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Wow.
Pheebs...
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
I just feel so, uhh.....
All right!!
Uh-huh!
I know!
What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
And he's, he's a total stranger?
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Umm.
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
Oh, I love museums!
Soakin' up all the culture.
Yeah.
Yes?
You and me, next dance?
Sweetheart, sweetheart...
You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
Oh, okay.
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.
I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.
Wow! Umm....
Oh, I know.
Have fun!
Thanks! Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!
So-so come! Why don't you come?
What?!
Yeah, right.
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
What, forget it!
Come on, I need your help here.
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
Oh, great.
Hey.
Hey! How did everybody sleep?
Like a log.
Us too.
I don't know.
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Hey, you.
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
How are you?
Good. How are you?
I guess.
Really?
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
Hey, save us some pizza.
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
I have.
Okay!
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
What's that smell?
Oh I...
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
Oh yeah.
Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy.
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
How long you been waitin' to say that?
'Kay.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Okay.
Well...
Yeah.
Absolutely.
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Take it back?
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Arghh!!
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Hello?
Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Aw.
Okay.
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Done.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Hi Steve!
Ewwww!!
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Ewwww!!
Goodnight.
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Mmm. Oh, no-
Sorry-
Hey...
Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Go! Go! Go!
NOW!!!!!!!!
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Hi!!
Hey!
Hi.
Hey!
Hi!
Joey?!
Who?
Joey.
Yeah!
Are you serious?!
Me?!
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Oh, just ask him!
I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
Melissa!
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?!
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
Mom!
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
There she is.
Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
Pretty much.
Monica?!
Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars.
We won't. 300?
I'm just trying to spice it up!
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
Nobody.
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Who's that?
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Is that Mark?
None.
You have no idea who I am, do you.
No, none at all.
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Noo!!
Who are they killing off?
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Nice.
Ohhh!!!
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
What's going on?
HI!! Hi!
What?! What?!
Ohhh!!!!
OK.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Yes, yes, that's right...
Oh, look at the little cat!
Ow!!
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
I know.
Oh God!
Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Oww!
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Really?
Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Oww!
Petty...
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
Petty...
Petty...
Petty...
Phoebe's...
Rachel...
and...
please...
leave...
Phoebe...
Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
No!
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
Hey Joey.
Rachel...
Hi...
it's...
and...
Phoebe's...
Really.
Oh, yeah, right.
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Right...
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Sit!
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Oh-ho, yeah!
Hi.
Oh my gosh, Joshua!
Sorry-
Goodnight.
Mmm. Oh, no-
No no no, go-
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
Uh-hmm.
Nothing.
Okay, can we just sign please?
Congratulations.
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
Uh-oh.
Coming.
I have a bone to pick with you.
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Umm...
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
Okay.
What's up?
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
Well?
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Lemme see.
Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
Really?
Wha...
No, I'm just....
Maybe there's someone else.
Is there? Is there someone else?
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Wow!!
Hey!
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
Look, look!
Hey, what's this?!
Yep!
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Go!!
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Oh no.
Why, when did you get out of the game?
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry!
It's All Relative!!
You don't have to shout everything.
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
Viva Las Gaygas!
Thank you.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Oh, yeah.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
I knew.
Okay.
Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I did.
All right.
But I...
No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
Thank you!
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
You do?
Really?
Mmmm.
I do.
Oh Ross, you're so great.
Oh good.
Alright.
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother.
Oh Drake.
What? What?!
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Can I just say one thing?
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Oh!!
Y'know what?
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
I can't do this.
Hey! Hi!
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
Oh Phoebe!
You just said it!
Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
What?! That's the first time today!
Ohh!
Oh hi!
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Hi Rachel.
Wow, love your new nose!
Jack.
Oh yeah!
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
Hello, children!
Hey! Hey!
Yeah! Okay.
That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like...
Who is it?
Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.
Yeah, I know.
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life.
What?
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
Well, I...
Well, well I can up with it!
YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
Hello.
Hey.
Oh Pheebs.
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
Phoebe, that stuff is...
Oh, hi!
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Rach! Rach!
Oh my God, I'm married!
I know.
I got it!
Oh.
Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
Is it back in the cage?
Its back in cage!
Oh no!
Ohh! Oh my God!
You like it?
It's my new apothecary table!
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
And Ross.
And Joey....
Hi!
Hi!

Oh god.
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
'Sup?
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Hi.
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
...Monica.
Surprise...
Sur-surprise.
And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
Yeah.
14?
Sandwiches!
Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
No, 19.
Thanks man.
32.
Allison's birthday party.
Oh, and how is Allison?
Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
Yeah, look how that worked out.
A-ha!
So, did you shave your legs?
Yeah.
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
Agghhh.
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
So were you in Nam?
Rock-paper-scissors?
Aghh.
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
Me too.
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
Ah!
Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you...
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
She's not crazy is she?
No.
Ah.
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
Oh, hi, darling!
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
Ahh!
Yep.
This one's from me.
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
A scooter!
Ahhhh!
What are you shushing?
We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?
See?
Huh.
Ahhhh!!
Ooohhhh!!
And, and!
Hey, my Father's house does that!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Ahhhh.
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
Hey Rach.
Oh. And how was the date?
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Ahhhh....
Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
Oh yeah.
Ahhh...... Eh?
Uh-huh.
Alimony.
Well no brush!
Fine! Y'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Almost.
Ohh, yes.
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
How much was it?
It was only 500 bucks.
Alright...
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Alright.
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
And-Joey!
And, I'll be nice.
And you'll be topless?
Do you want me to learn?!
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Ankle.
Why? Why would you do that?
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
We'll see.
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
Anymore!!
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Okay.
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Anything?
No. Why?
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
You told them he was missing?
Arghhhh!!!!!!
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
Aww.
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Great. It's gym class all over again.
Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Awww...
Really?
Yeah! Come on.
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Left.
Awwww.
What?
Beth is really, really sick.
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
Joey?
Barry?
Quack, quack..
Ross? That opens my cervix.
C'mon in.
Are you sure?
Barry?!
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Rachel.
I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.
Oh!
Basketball!
Okay.
Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime.
I'm sorry.
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
Beef.
It sure is.
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
But....
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.
Okay.
Bye-bye-e!
You take care Jill.
Okay, see ya!
Bye.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Bye-bye.
Impressive.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy.
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
Cappuccino.
Coffee.
Thank you.
Grazie.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Carol...Lesbian?
Yeah!
What's her last name?
Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
What line?
Charming.
Oh, seriously?
Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...
Well hey, it's just a backup.
Yeah.
Coffee.
No way!
Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
Thank you.
Cappuccino.
Coming.
Oh.
Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
I have a bone to pick with you.
Uh-oh.
Credit.
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
What did you get?
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
Hi.
Cupid.
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
Man, do you know what guys want!
DANGER!!!!!
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Oh.
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
Damn!
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
They're still in my coat.
Hey!
Hey! You ready to go?
Drums?
Hey!
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
No! Drums!
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
Everybody...
Okay.
Hi...
It's...
Rachel...
Eww!
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
No.
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
Five.
Uh, four.
Four.
Five.
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
For...me.
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
Well, not just for you.
Well, what do you mean?
Four.
Okay, they are.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Really?!
Go!!
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Go-go!
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
Did you really hear a bear?
Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
Ohh, thank you.
Grape.
What is this? What are we doing?
Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
OK, now, sit. OK.
Oh, God.
Guess!
Hey!
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
Umm, a flea market?
Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
Hi-e!!
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
Uh, hello!
Ooh, what do I smell?
I don't know, it smells good.
Hi...
Yeah.
Okay.
it's...
Rachel...
Hm-m.
Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
What'd I say?
Are these the shoes?
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Hm-mm.
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
Ohh!
Hm-mmm!
Macadamia nut?
Umm... Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Nope!
Hmm-mmm.
Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.
He just got a divorce right?
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
Hmmm!
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
Oh my God!
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Honey.
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
What, what oh....
Shall we?
Hormones!
Nooo, later.
Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!!
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
Hypothetically!
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Yes!!! Oh!!
Still.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
I-Ohh!
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
There you go! There you are!
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
Impressive.
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
No no no no.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Bye-bye.
Insane!
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
...from the syphilis.
What?!
Interesting.
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Half hour.
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Jeez!
All right!!
I'm coming already!!
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Hello, Chip.
Kinda.
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Oh-ohh, thank you.
Left.
Awww...
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Damnit!
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
Mexico?
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Who did we fight in World War I?
Yes! Very good.
Hey Joey! We're ready.
Mm-mmm.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Monica!!!
Well, of course.
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
NO!
Hey.
Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
No?
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
No..!
I'm not telling.
Come on, show them to me.
Show them to me!
Get your hands out of there! No!
No....
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
I don't know... um, Grease?
Rent?
Yes! Rent!
Nooo...
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Noooo.
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
What?!
Noooooo!!
My apothecary table!!!
What?!
Ross, where did you get this?!
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Noooooooo!
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Your messages have been erased.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
No. But that reminds me, sign this.
Noooooooo!!
I haven't seen it yet!
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
Nope!
Hm-mmm!
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
Hey Pheebs!
Nothing?
Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
Nothing.
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
O-okay!
Yeah.
You wanna work on your interview skills?
Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Hi.
OK!
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Let's run towards them!
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
OOooooo!
Oh, you're...
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Oh-ho!
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Oke-dokey.
Sorry.
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
Oh-oh!
Yeah.
Good-good-good.
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
Oh-ow!
That's it. Ow!!!
Oh my God!
All right.
Ow!
Ohh!!
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
Oh sure! Noo!
My apothecary table!!!
What?!
Ohh-ha-ha!
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Ohhh!!
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
Nope! Something else.
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Ohhh.
Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Do you think he knew I was here?
Ahh, ahh, excuse me.
Yeah?
Ohhhh!
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
I was her accountant four years ago.
I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
That's great!
Ok?
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
Ok.
Ok.
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
Oohhh.
You're kiddin'.
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
Hi.
Hi.
Oooh!
Yeah.
Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
Oooh.
What, what, what?
It's an empty apartment.
We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
Ooohhhh!!
Uh-huh.
Watch, watch.
And, and!
Ahhhh!!
Op.
I know!
I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?
Eh.
Oh, you got me.
Or?
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Burning's good.
Pardon?
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
That would be nice.
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Phoe-be!!
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
Really!?
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
Relaxi-Taxi!
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
The name was my favourite part!
Well, well I can up with it!
Rock-paper-scissors?
Agghhh.
So were you in Nam?
Yeah.
One two three.
Rosss...
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Come on, would you grow up? It's no big deal.
All right. Fine.
Sagittarius?
Virgo?
Nope.
Yep.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
Shhhh!
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
No, no, no. No-no-no.
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Sick-sick-sick-sick.
Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
I saved you a seat.
Oh, I'll get it.
Gotcha!
Small...
Petty...
Petty...
Small...
You are so just doing this out of spite.
So....
Ohh! Hi!
Hi!
No.
Ohhhh, come on!!!
Sp-spoil?
Really?
Someone I can spoil, y'know?
Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
Uh-huh.
Sucker!
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Okay!
Hello? Hey Joey!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
Surprise!!
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
What?
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
Surprise!!!
Awwww!
Hello?
Surprise!!
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Surprise...
What do you, what do you mean?
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
Sur-surprise.
...Monica.
Sweety...
Oh my Gosh!
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
Hey Duck, is Chick here?
Tah-daaah!
Yeah! C'mon!
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Tails!
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. Okay, somebody call it this time.
Oh yeah!
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
Fears and Pet Peeves.
Taurus?
I bet you're a Gemini.
Nope.
Nope.
Virgo?
Tequila!!
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
That's fun.
Here you go.
That's....
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
That's what?!
That is neither here nor there.
Together.
Both of you?
Yep.
Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
Together?
You're getting a cat?
Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.
Uh huh.
Both of you?
Uff.
Honey, this will help.
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
That is never good.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
Ugh...
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
We ruined everything.
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
What do you, what do you mean?
Ughh!
Because he's stealing from me!
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
Thank you so much Phoebe.
Uhhhooo.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Well, there's you.
Unbelievable.
Very nice touch.
'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.
Thank you so much.
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Up!
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Yeah.
You changed?
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Vanilla?!
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
Yeah.
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Virgo?
Taurus?
Nope.
Nope.
Sagittarius?
Waitressing?
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Uh-oh.
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
We?!
Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
We thought you knew!
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
You all know? Does Ross know?
Wh-what?!
I know!
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Wh?!
What were you thinking?!
I didn't know it was an auction!
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
What!
What have I not told you?
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
I didn't know it was a big secret.
What!?
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
To be nice.
What.
What?!
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
Where?!
Hey!
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
On the touchy.
And that's not against your oath?!
Whoa-ho.
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
I don't know.
Why.
What?
Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.
Just go.
Surprise.
Y'know...
Sorry.
Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice?
I like it.
Yeah!!
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
With extra pulp?
No!
D'oh!! I've got it!
Yeah-eah-ha!
Sure.
Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
Yeesss.
Yeah.
One two three.
Fine, go have sex.
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
Yes!!!
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
Yes?!
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Ah, just one other thing.
I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
Do you want my pickle?
Yesterday!
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
You!
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
No.
Oh.. you don't get it!
Whaddya got there?
You.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
Really?
Yeah.
You?
No.
OK, who is the boss of you?!!
No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
How ya doin'?
leave...
Phoebe's...
please...
leave...
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
yeah-yeah-yeah!!
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
Oh-oh, okay, okay! If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. You have a pleasant evening.
So, you're like a zillionaire?
I'm in.
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Yeah. Um... I'm out.
Me too.
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
What?! What?!
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
No way! It's mine!!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
Monica what?
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
What?!
What is the emergency?!
Hey you.
Hi you guys.
Hey.
Hey you.
Woah, hey, yo.
Ohh, sorry.
Oh wow!
What are you doing?
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
Ohh whoops.
Oh, god.
Really?
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Ohhh.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
I promise.
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
Yeah, I...
Joshua.
Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know.
But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
Oh, thank goodness!
Okay, fine.
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
Okay. Okay!
That's okay.
Okay.
1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
I don't know!
Okay! Okay! Here!
The Bible?!
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
Diverse.
All right!
This is the coolest house ever!!
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?
I would!
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Oh. Oh!
Okay.
Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
So where are we going next?
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Ohh, God.
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
Good morning.
Well, somebody got some last night.
Oh my God!
Hockey! Hockey! Hockey.
Rachel?
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
What are you guys doing here?
That's great!
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Nice!
Excellent!
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
I believe it.
Ross, don't start.
Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
No you don't.
Yes, I do.
Thank God.
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
Oh, okay!
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
My God!
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Oh!
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Excuse me?
Ohh, great!
Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Ohh, fun!
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
Yeah.
Come on!
All right, but in the future...
Okay!! Okay!!
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
Okay, one...two...
Thank you!
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Yes, Papaya Extract.
So uh, have a great time down there.
I will.
We do?
What are you guys doing later?
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
I want to see what he wants first.
Okay.
No. No.
Oh, yeah go ahead.
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
Okay! All clear!
Thanks Phoebe!
It's fine.
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
No, but, your-your mad.
I'm not mad.
I have one.
Come on, there's gotta be something.
Nope, she's perfect.
Good! Great! You can go first.
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
Oh, hi.
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
Until now.
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
Oh my God, honey that's great.
Yeah, I do.
Oh yeah, what's it about?
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
Ross, I...
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Really?! How do you know?
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Well I...
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
Hey! Don't be a baby!
Let's go!!
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
Okay, I do.
Ow! Ow!
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Okay.
I really do.
You did!
I am not a pushover!
Who said you were?
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
Yeah right.
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
OK.
Well no.
Joey, I really don't...
Can you tell me how this happened?
Miracle!
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
I really do.
Okay, I do.
Okay.
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
I'm so sorry.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Yeah, have a seat.
That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
I feel...
I just, I feel, I-I just...
What?
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
But I made cards!!
Okay, Chandler!
He's holding us back.
Totally.
Okay.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
That's right!
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
Oh my God.
And she's not crazy?
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
Oh wow!
Here you go.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
Ohh, sorry.
Oh wow.
Hi!
You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
But I...
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
All right.
Yeah, you do.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Ohh! Hi!
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
Hi!
So....
Do you?
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
Oh, hey!
Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
Emily is...incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!
Hey! You were so right!
What?
No! Joey!
Joey, you have got to take this back!
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
What's that?
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Okay.
You don't.
OK.
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Really?
You sure?
Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
That's okay.
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
Oh, I did!
Yeah. Hi Mark!
Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
Yes.
Oh my God!!
Hey you!
What happened you guys?
Rach!
Hey, come on in.
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Oh, God...
Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
The end.
Should I not have told you?
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
Come on.
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
No!
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
You know what?
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
What?
You know what?
What happened?
Yeah, right.
Aaawwwwww!!
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Me too.
Hey! How'd it go?
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Ohh, good.
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
And I do have one seat left.
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Yes, Ross.
Right.
Okay. Honey?
I love you.
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
No. I...
Well...
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
Call her! Call her now!
No. Why?
Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up?
Umm, is Tag here?
Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't... I never said that.
You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
We're sorry.
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
...No, we hate him.
Ma! What're you doing here?
I came to give you this and this.
Oh, I know...
Oh, I....
Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?
Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
Isn't this great?!
That's nice.
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Ohhhh...
Mom, so what did you think?
Well that was umm...Okay.
Well umm...
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
Oh-whoa, what party?
The baby shower for Phoebe!
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
Yeah! Why?
Hey.
Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Oh man!
Okay.
So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Oh my...
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
In the death seat?!!
Hey guys!
Hey!
Oh ok.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
Happy birthday sweetie.
Ok.
Oh yes.
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Yeah, sure.
Bye.
Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
Thank you.
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Okay, uh...
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
I don't want to marry Chandler!
I've got cold feet.
...it's gonna be okay!
What's this.
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
Could you get us a couple of beers?
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Oh, thanks.
Hey!
You look great!
You okay over there?
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Hi you!
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
Yep, sucks!
Oh my God!
I know, I can do more than cook.
It's Joshua.
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
Oh, whatever.
Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
Hey, Monica!
Hey!
Hey!
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
Yeah, sure?
Uh, yeah, if you want too.
Do you want me too?
So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
And um, what-what is that Ross?
Hi! Phoebe.
Of course!!
Hi, guys.
Hi Phoebe.
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
Like what?
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Oh! Ow!
Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
We did!
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
We did have fun, didn't we?
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
Oh, I would love to!
OK, OK.
Wait, so, you're going?
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
Cat.
Hey Joey.
For what?
What?
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
I've gotta get back in the game.
Why, when did you get out of the game?
Yeah, why?
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
No reason.
Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?
What's this?
Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
This is the coolest house ever!!
What? Why?!
Wh-You dated my sister!
That was different!
This is weird for me!
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
Oh Mom!
Hi, Mrs. Green.
So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
Believe me, sometimes that happens.
Oh really?!
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Oh well...
Yeah!
Can he handle the stick?
I can handle the stick!!
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and...
Yeah. Sure.
I know, Monica told me.
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Can you people not see me?!
So, will you talk to him?
I know! What?!
I don't know!
Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
Hey Joey!
Hey, you guys!
Hey!
Hey.
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Hi Ross!
Wow! Well, welcome back!
Yeah.
Hey Rachel.
Is Joey Tribbiani here?
Guess what?
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
You got a job?
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
Ross's what?
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
Phoebe?
That's fine!
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
I know.
Umm, hi!
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Okay, yeah!
Hi.
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
No. Sorry.
Hmm, bite me.
Did he call?
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Oh, Ross...
Ooh, I've been better...
Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
What?
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Oh, wait-wait-wait...
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
You tell them to wait!
Okay. Wait! Wait!
I had one.
Hey.
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
That's funny.
I am loud!
Aww!
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
Oh sure! Noo!
Yeah, so?
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
And now I've picked it up again.
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
Oh. Right.
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
Hell no, we'll pay!
Ohh! Okay!
Ohh, I would love too.
Yeah? Oh-oh, she'd be so excited!
Come on!
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
Oh, me too.
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
We get high.
I'm kidding.
Oh, me too.
Excuse me?
What?
Just ah...
Here let me...
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
Oh, it's okay.
Ohh!
We're sorry honey.
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
And heels.
Hey, Pheebs!
Hey, Phoebe!
Hi, Pheebs!
Hey, Pheebs!
What are you reading?
Mon. Hi!
Hi you guys!
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Hi.
Why aren't you at work?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
Pretty soon I guess.
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Yes, I do.
I believe it.
No you don't.
No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
What's up?
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
I was just being polite, but, alright.
In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
What?
Hi, guys!
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
Hi!
Uh, hey!
Hey, Mon.
There were times when it wasn't even me.
That is so sweet, you guys.
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
Mon!
Oh, thank you.
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
I'll take a look at him.
Michael.
Rachel.
I'm sorry?
Secret affair!
People are doing it in front of my book!
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
I'm unpacking!
I know, I took it hard too.
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
What?!
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
This one?
You're just staring into space.
Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.
It worked!
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
I'm sorry, what?
Whoa, she's pretty.
Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
What?
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
You shouldn't.
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Oh that's great!
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Congratulations!
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
What is it?
Saw your head. Saw your head.
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
I think so.
How about you guys?
Open bar?
I can do that for the kids.
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
Wow! Monica!
Just come.
Oh my God!
Great!
This is beautiful!
What?! Why?!
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
What about the closeness?
Okay, coming!
Eat your fish.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Hi, come on in.
Hey.
Really? Really?!
Yes!
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Yes!
Okay! "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time!
Oh my god.
Oh, I hate this story.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
That's weird.
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah. Well, umm.....
Rach, are you okay?
You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
I did not!
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
What was that?
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
What?
You just did a little dancy thing.
I'll do it.
To the Bings!
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Who wants it? Anybody?
I said I'll do it!
Hi, Pheebs.
This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!
Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Bye, Pheebs.
Oh, my god.
So, um, will you bring the truck?
I'll even let you ring the bell.
See, there you go, the cleansing works!
They're nice guys.
Does it?
So umm, does it?
I'm sorry.
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
Oh that's okay.
So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
Oh, sorry!
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Hey Pheebs.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Hey!
Any sign of your brother?
What? Who?
Exactly.
Ohh, yeah I already have one.
Phoebe.
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Oh crap!
No don't! Go back to repeating!
Damnit!
Oh crap!
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Oh damnit!
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Oh damnit!
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
Oh my....
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
Got 'em.
Hi.
Oh no-no-no...
Well...
Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
Oh please...
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
Are you?!
No.
Oh yay!
Oh. Oh, right.
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
Not great.
Okay.
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
What party?
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
You know, a party, or--
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
You like me?
Why?!
Because I-I like you.
Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Monica, please?
Oh, come on!
Chasing him all around the room?
He's totally flirting with you too.
He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something...
Hey Chandler!
I can't believe this!
Screw it! I'm having one.
Hey!
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Wait! Okay!
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Hit me!
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
I bet 20.
I know that too.
I know.
I am so sorry.
Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
Hey!
I love you too.
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Yeah, I'm good.
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
Oh, I....
What?!
Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?
Oh, I know...
Oh, hmm.
What?
Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy...
Joshua.
Oh, seriously?
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...
Charming.
Oh, come on!
Take it like a man, Ross!
No! No!
Big bullies!!
Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!
Oh, you got me.
Op.
Eh.
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
Oh, that sounds great.
Yeah, maybe...
I did.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Goodnight.
Yeah, whoosh!
Do we need a cake?
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
But it's Ross.
It's Ross.
Oh my God!!
Oh, I did!
Yes.
Congratu!! -lations-lations.
So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
Well, there's you.
Uhhhooo.
C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Better not be doin' these in order.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Get up!
I came with Paul!
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Here you go honey!
Ahh. Thank you!
I gotta go!
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
Crap!!
Hey.
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
I'll say.
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
Is this what you had in mind?
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
Ohh! Really?!
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Tell him.
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Y'know Marcel?
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Oh, what? What-what?
...Yeah?
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
No! Nothing!
Oh.
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
Yeah! That would be great!
Hi Pheebs.
I love you.
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
Hi!
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
Well you better.
Yes it is.
Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
Did you like it?
No, I don't.
It's Joshua.
What, he doesn't like Josh?
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
You can?
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Well, I think I can help you get over him.
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Um-hmm.
You don't?!
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Look. Look, I wasn't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
You idiot!!
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
I did! I absolutely did!
I'm sure you're right, but why?
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
You think?!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
That's just great.
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
Um, cheers.
Oh, right, clink.
All right!!
Pheebs...
I just feel so, uhh.....
I'm coming already!!
Jeez!
Yeah, it is.
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
Honey, I'm sorry.
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
Oh, yeah, right.
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Really.
I know. I'm sorry.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Yeah.
Because you do.
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Yeah, I know.
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Ross thanks.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
You want me to call her right now?
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Thank you Phoebe.
No!!
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
She didn't.
I know.
Oh. Oh, right.
What?
For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
Oh yay!
Say it!
Chuck Woolery?
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who's ass I cannot kick.
Say we are unagi!
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
No, nothin'.
Hi.
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
I hope she's OK.
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
Well, that's great.
From now?
Yeah.
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
I'm gonna do it.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
But I...
No. Nothing.
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
Something wrong?
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
Settle what?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
I'm a waitress.
Oh.
I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
Yeah. Gotcha.
Ohh, yes.
Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
Almost.
That's not Ross!
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Oh, thank God.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Hi.
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Hi Pheebs!
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
Hey!
Are you moving out?
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
Sorry. Sorry.
Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
Umm...
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
Are you okay?
Go! Go! Go!
Score!! 7 to nothing!
Come on, let's go!
Losers walk!
No, I knew.
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
Really?
All right.
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
That's all right.
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
That's okay.
That's okay.
Can I talk to you for a second?!
Hi, Julie.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Hi, Julie!
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
Yeah, she's...
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
You love her.
You're kidding.
Who's Barney.
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
This is amazing.
I know.
How are you?
Oh, hi!
Hi!
Good.
Hey.
Why not?
Hey, aren't you up next?
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
Phoebe, Ross sucks!
Well, you would know.
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
Oh, come on!
Okay, bye-bye!
All right, I'll see you tonight.
Okay.
Bye!
Bye-bye!
Ah, yeah!
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
I'd wait.
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
What?
You'd wait?
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
HI!! Hi!
What's going on?
Ohhh!!!
What?! What?!
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife...
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
And Joey....
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Hi!
Hi!
And Ross.
And Mrs.?!
I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
Oh! Yeah, y'know you and Ross are still married.
What?!!
And heels.
Oh, it's okay.
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
Oh no, yeah.
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
Where are you gettin' this?
Yeah, I got that.
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
You take care Jill.
I don't gossip!
Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Y'know what? We need to move on.
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
Uh-oh, busted!
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Hi, sure!
Can I get you some coffee?
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Hi.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Ohh! Oh God!
What?!!
Just kidding!
Saved your ass.
Hey!
Yes I am!
I'm fine, I'm fine.
No you're not.
Rach!
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
You love her.
Yeah, she's...
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
No, I don't.
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
No we...
Hi Phoebe.
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
Hormones.
...hormones, yeah.
Ow! Ow!
Ow!
Rach?
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Okay, I do.
What line?
Carol...Lesbian?
Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
What uh-oh?
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Ross, what's the matter?
Here you go.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
What else?
Thank you.
Oh wow!
Well, but Pheebs.
Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Ohh, ohh.
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Oh God, Phoebe!
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
I'm talking about massages.
Oh.
I didn't know that.
Thank you.
We're not done.
Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
Fine, I will.
Hi you guys!
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Hey!
Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Mon. Hi!
How long?
What?! You slept with Jason?
You'd already broken up.
A couple hours.
Oh, that's nice!
Oh, do I?
Pretty well, actually...
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
Uh huh.
We ended up having sex in his chair.
We're good?
Thank you. So are we good?
We're good.
Yeah.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
A lot.
Oh.. a little..
Mm-hmm..
Mm.
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
You're hurt!
All right Ross!! I get it!!
I mean my God...
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
You're welcome.
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
Hi you guys.
Woah!
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
Hey.
Hey you.
Oh, I know, I know.
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
Somebody wanna help me out here?
How, how can you be here and there.
'Cause it's a television show.
Yeah, come here!
You like it right?
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
No you don't!
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Oh, we have some...
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
A tad.
What's up?!
Hey!
Hi!
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
No, I'm not.
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
But you're not anymore!
'Cause you guys were on a break.
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
This is Chandler.
Oh my God, Rachel!
Oh my God, introduce us!
Hi!
And you know Monica and Ross!
What? Wh-hey!
Noo! Angels.
I'm gettin' my chair back!
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Joey you broke my chair!!
Well yeah...
Hi!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Really?!
Blow it.
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Sophisticated like a hooker?
Ohhh, OK.
What, isn't he sober?
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
Rub it.
Oh, come on squeeze it.
No.
No.
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
Hi honey!
Hey, hold on a second.
Okay.
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Yes, you did.
Okay, anything for you sir?
Did I not just tell him?
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
It's not all juice!
"Ooo," what?
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
Oooooo....
Uma Thurman.
Oh!
Heard what?
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
Joanna passed away last night.
Oh my God! How?!
Saw what?
Wait, wait, wait!
So I guess you all saw it.
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Whoa what?
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Whoa!
Ross has a boyfriend.
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Monica? Monica!
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Water rules!
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Yeah! Sit!
Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you.
Great!
You okay?
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Ohh, thank you.
Ross gave it to me.
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
I'll get her.
I-I-I think you look great.
Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
Please hurry.
Don't you just love the way they talk?!
I dumped him.
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
Be right there. Be back in a sec.
Okay.
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Got 'em.
Hi.
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
What are you smiling at?
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
You're over me?
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Ohh, ohh.
Okay then!
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
Don't do that.
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Don't do that.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
No. Thank you.
Ow!
Aren't you gonna go?
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
We won't?
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
No, no, we won't.
C'mon.
OK, that's dead right?
Surprise me.
Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car.
What do you need from the car?
Okay.
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
Get off.
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
Hello Rachel.
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Great! Thanks!
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Okay.
There you go!
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Very good.
And-and what else?
That you and daddy were not on a break.
Rachel! What are you doing here?
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Me too!
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
I'm so proud of you.
Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
I know.
Sure! Why?
Coffee in a fight!
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Well, have fun!
Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
Okay.
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Gay? Yeah.
Hi!
Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he...
Hey! Terry.
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
Um... Ross?
Pheebs, what about you?
Oh... Milwaukee.
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
No way!
Yeah. Gotcha.
I'm a waitress.
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Ok. That's fine.
Yeah. Hmmmm.
Now that she broke up with you?
Yeah.
It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
Hi Daddy.
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
Baby. Ross.
Dr. Green. How are you?
Then, no.
Did you talk to him?
Not yet.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
Why's that?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
I don't think I should say.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Yes, we do.
Yeah... ....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Alright, check.
Check.
I got the job!
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
That's great! Hey! Excellent!
Oh, God bless us, everyone.
I'm not mad.
It's fine.
No, but, your-your mad.
No.
I'm just not going.
I can't do this.
Y'know what?
No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Shut up!
Tell him, tell him.
Just...please tell him.
Tell me what?
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Ow! Ross!!
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
Okay, bye-bye.
Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
Get down?
He's back! The peeper's back!
Get down!
...And boogie!
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Oh! Thank God!
Remoray!
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!
Hope! Hope!
Drake!
Hey, Sophie!
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Hey, Rach!
Hey.
Hey, hubby!
Morning!
Hey!
Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
Uh-huh.
Oh! Pathetic!
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Where?
Thanks Chandler.
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Okay, okay, okay.
I cannot push it in!
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
I got it!
Okay.
Yeah me too.
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
Totally. I'm like 90/10.
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
Mr. Treeger.
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
Uhh, you said there was a party.
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Oh, that's sweet.
Yeah.
All right, I just wanted to check.
You're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Uhh, hang in there?
Oh, that's true.
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
Ya think?
What what what what?
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
No, was he any good in it?
Who is it?
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
It's me, Carl.
C'mon up.
Ok, you win.
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Are you sure?
Barry?
C'mon in.
Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
Huh?!
Hi. I'm back.
Eh? We'll show him!
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
No! No-no-no...
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Uh, Joey..
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Oh, God!
Okay..
All right, fine.
But I...
Please!
Joey, I'm in!
All right. Good deal.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
Hi, sweetie!
Phew, close one.
Hi.
Hello.
Hi, Ross.
Really? Me?
So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
You're twins?
Must pee.
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
What does she do?
What?! What?! What?!
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!
I won! That was my guess!
I guessed 20,000!
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
What was that?!
Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Hey Rach!
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
I haven't seen it yet!
Who was that?
Last time I do that, I promise.
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
See ya.
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Um-hmm, yeah.
What did you do?
What 'cha doing?
Wait a minute!
What?! What?!
Oh yes!
Oh yes!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
Okay.
C'mon up.
Who is it?
It's me, Carl.
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Seven hundred bucks!
Shut up.
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
You do now. You're having dinner with me.
I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
Look at that!
He doesn't speak much English.
Monopoly!
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Oh... Italy, I think.
Pheebs, that's great!
Yes!
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
Oh, yay!
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
Yeah, you bet.
Yeah, me too.
So, see ya on Saturday.
Oh.
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Oh, of course!
Yep!
Alex Trebek?
Chuck Woolery?
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who's ass I cannot kick.
We're not?!
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
No we're not.
All right, I like that.
Phoebe, woo!
Phoebe!
Hey, Pheebs!
Okay, woo! Hi.
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
What are you doing?
Hey!
I got me some drinks!
Open bar!
Well now it's an empty bar.
No. No-no-no-no.
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Really?
The commercial?
I had to go with the odds Rach.
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
No!
That play?
The fear?
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
I had a wedding.
Well, Mon, I was married.
Yeah, me, too, technically.
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
Oh yeah? Okay.
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
Okay.
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
I'm sorry Joey.
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Sorry.
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Pretty much.
Mom!
Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
You remember Ross.
Hi Daddy!
This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
Um-hmm.
Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
I-I-I don't know.
Yes! You're never gonna make it!
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
What's the matter?
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
It's Fun Bobby.
What, isn't he sober?
Oh, that's funny!
And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
I want a baby.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Um, Barry.
Oh, sorry.
My God, what were you thinking about?
Awwww!!
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
What what what what?
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
Ya think?
Good for me!
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Y'okay, Phoebe?
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh....
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
You got ink on your lip.
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Oh. We?
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Well, we were very young when we had her.
Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to...
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
So, I love you.
Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
Na-huh.
I love you.
And y'know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8:30.
Hey, you guys...
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Hey!
Is Monica here?
Hi, I'm Rachel.
Oh, c'mon in.
Thanks.
Hi.
Bathroom's up there.
Yes! Thank you.
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
Fruitflies?
So, would you like any dessert?
No! No dessert, just a check, please.
Look at her.
No.
Huh.
Hi Monica.
He-he-he, how's it goin'?
So don't do it.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
Monica, relax, go get a beer.
Good different?
Ewwwww!
Uh-oh.
Nobody likes change.
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Oh! Thank you!
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Here.
So now what's going on here?
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Hi Daddy!
Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
Gotcha.
This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
You remember Ross.
Hi sweetie!
U-N-I-sexy?
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Hey, how are you holding up?
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Oh honey, I'm sorry.
Um-hmm.
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Ohh! That's so great!
Oh yeah! I know.
Oh look! A letter from my mom.
So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Can you hear anything?
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Big night!
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
This is so cool!
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
You just said it!
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Oh Phoebe!
I'm not telling.
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
No, not this time. So... what'd you have?
Come on, show them to me.
No..!
Oh my god!!
Skull?
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
Hey!
Have fun!
Oh.
So, we're off.
Thanks! Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!
Oh, I know.
What's 1922?
No. Well, yeah, maybe.
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
What's Flimby's?
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
You do? Why?
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
Because I think it means more to you.
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
What? Wait, what?
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Yeah, well...nah.
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
Phoebe, you're on.
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Woooo! Yeah!
Oh, oh, good.
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Oh, that is so...
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
My drinking?
What?
That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking...
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
Said what? Exactly.
Wow! Umm....
Oh, okay.
I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.
I dropped a cup.
...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
Wow... Wow!
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
Yeah.
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
You and Ralph?
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
Kenny the copyboy.
Hey.
Just a job!
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
Yes.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Bye Mon.
Yeah.
Bye house!
Bye.
Hey.
Thanks, Mon.
Hey Danny.
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Well, of course.
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
And did you?!
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
I don't think so.
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
You can, I know you can!
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Have at it.
Hey! What's up Mon?
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
Are you kidding?!
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
No!
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
Are you serious?!
Joey?!
Yeah!
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
Just once!
Yes!
Get away!
Stay away!
Take it like a man, Ross!
Ross! Janice?!
You two will have very hairy children.
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Yeah, that's true.
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Oh, I'm sorry what?
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
So...
Um, hum.
Right.
Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
No.
I know, yeah, sorry.
Maybe you should put it off.
No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
What, it's not your fault.
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
Yes it is.
Well I love you too.
Well that's the first time we've said that.
Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
Well you better.
What are these?
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Saucy!
Electrical plans for the building.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Uh, wh-why?
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
No! It's nice!
Nice to see you Rachel.
Okay, a thousand.
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
What?!
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
You just finished?
Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
Done!
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
So umm, does it?
Hey Jess.
Come in.
Hey Jessica.
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Hi.
Hey Mon!
Hi Monica!
Hey Mon!
Oh my God, has she slept at all?
Nope.
Hey roomie!
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
I am now!
Okay, bye!
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
How is she?
At least as long as I have the pants.
I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
How's the hair?
Bye, Chandler.
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Me too.
So ah, what's wrong with him?
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Good luck.
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
All right, be my guest.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
Oh, I got it.
No you guys...
No! Wait! Come on!
Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
I-I-am-
EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
Over here!
Hike!
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
I almost caught that one!
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Oh really, OK.
Is Ross here?
No he went out to get pizza.
That's great.
Very tasteful.
I cannot believe you.
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
Eh, 'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
What?
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
Oh! That's fine.
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
Great! Okay, good for you!
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
God, he's good.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
If only he were a woman.
Yeah.
Bye, Pheebs.
Hi, Pheebs.
Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
From now?
You mean, you mean 30 days?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Not interested.
When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
Number six: the way you smell.
Show time!
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
Okay!
Take care.
Tuesday.
Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.
Bye Ben.
Bye.
Bye you guys!
All right, bye-bye now!
Bye!
Bye-bye!
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
There it is.
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What is going on?
We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
Yes! Rent!
No....
Rent?
Okay, so when do you want to go?
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Yes! Totally!
Yes. You're not asking are you?
No.
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Yes it is!
It's a, it's a cat!
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
Why is it inside out?!
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
I think it's sexy.
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
What?
Sexy?
Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
Oh God, absolutely.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Doctor Burke is sexy?
It's the museum again, can I, oh.
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
Is he here?
Okay, your highness.
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
No.
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
No, forget it.
Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
I guess you don't.
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Which proves that I never lie.
Paolo made a pass at me.
So, what do you think?
No, I'm just....
No!
Does he not make enough money?
Maybe there's someone else.
Wha...
Are you serious?
I'm talking about me having a baby.
What?
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
I had a bra.
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
...hormones, yeah.
No we...
Hormones.
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Ooooh yeah.
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
You need one too?
There's only one.
Monica.
Um-hmm, yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
See ya.
What did you do?
Um. yeah.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
I am soo dead.
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Okay, they are.
Okay.
Now, open your eyes.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Four.
I'm just not going.
I'm not mad.
No.
Your not going.
Right.
Okay. But wait!
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
What?!
Let's go to lunch.
How are ya?
Hi Pheebs!
Hi!
Good.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
A lover?
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
A surfer.
Oh yeah surfer?
A pajmena?
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
Huh? Oh, I got this--this!
Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Really?
A scooter!
Ahh!
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Kim, hi.
What's a matter with you?
What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
I'll go with you.
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
Me too.
Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
Oh. Oh my God.
You were with Julie?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Yeah, right. Sure!
Chandler told me.
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
When you were in China.
Alright, somebody.
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Whoooaa!
Oh it's important!
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
How is that important?
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
No it's not!
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
But it is our apartment!
You guys! You guys! You're gonna have a baby! They're gonna have a baby!
MY SISTER'S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
Well, there you go!
I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Close call day.
What do you mean?
Oh, honey.
Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
I think it went into me.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
Yeah, see ya.
Okay. See you guys later.
Bye guys.
Hey, thank you so much.
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Thank you judges.
Thanks!
Yes, very nice Rachel.
Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Oh!
Ugh, tramp!
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah.
Does Joey have any idea?
I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
You don't know?!
Second date!
...I dunno.
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Ohh. Ooh!
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Yes I did.
Hey!
Hey!
Let's roll!
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
Got it!
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Um, everyone?
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
All right. Fine.
Rosss...
Come on, would you grow up? It's no big deal.
Yowzah!!!
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Oh my God! Joey!
Yeah?
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
What is the matter with you?
Ugh!
Okay, my turn!!
Okay, that-that's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
Ohh!
Yeah, it's in there.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
That's not true!
Well he made Rachel cry!
Rachel always cries!
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Of course!
Okay.
Will you be my maid of honour?
Oh that's so great!
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
One hour.
All right, well how much time do you need?
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
Give me two.
Then why do you ask?!
Pick one.
All right.
Good!
Left! Thank you.
You're welcome.
Storming out!
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
What are you doing?
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
Oh, but that's okay.
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Aww, not right now.
I know.
Yeah.
Phoebe, are you okay?
Oh that is over!
That's terrible! I'm sorry!
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
Oh hey, here Pheebs.
Huh. All right.
Hey!
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Good bye!
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, but wait...
Actually, that's our three hole punch.
Hey.
Good ones?
Chocolate-chip pancakes!
We've got presents!
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Okay, what's up?
Hi!
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
You're so pretty.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Hi!
Hey, Phoebe.
Give me that!
What?
: Your Visa bill is huge!
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
I don't know.
Ohh! Oh my God!
Hey! We're here!
Hey!
You like it?
Oh no!
All right, Julie.
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
Phoebe's dead.
Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
Hi.
Hi.
Really Joey?
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
Okay.
What?
Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
Sit down!
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
Yeah.
Okay.
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
Your parents'?
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
Yeah, they're out of town.
Ohh.
Your sunglasses?!
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Yes!
Oh, right!
Absolutely! Absolutely!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
This is so much fun!
This is not fun!
Okay, I heard that.
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Monica bang!
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
Uh-huh.
Excuse me. Hi.
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
Hi.
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
Ohh! That's great!
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
Really?!
Oh, good point.
So?
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
Yeah!
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Well, I, umm...
Really?!
No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Hey, uh, Joey?
Good luck, honey!
Bye!
Umm?
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
What, what, what?
What?
Look, look, look.
It's an empty apartment.
Oooh.
Oh, good for you!
OK, so now we draw cards.
So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
Congratulations!
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
You will like it!
Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
No I won't.
You don't even know!
But, but?
Uh-oh.
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
I'm Rachel Green.
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
Yes.
Thank goodness.
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
Ross kissed me.
OK. Just for a little while.
OK.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
It was unbelievable!
Ohh, with who?
Where ya going?
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
Hello, Paul.
Morning.
Morning, Paul.
Hi, Paul, is it?
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Where's Chandler?
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
I'm free! I'm free!
Yeah, oh wait!
Okay? Whoa, wait!
Good idea!
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
Phoebe.
No, just singing.
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Did you say something?
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
Yeah, but y'know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
Just a waitress?
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
I think you should go.
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Okay, okay, okay.
What?
I really think you need to go now.
Ask me what?
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Are you drunk?!
Where the hell've you been?
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Are you pregnant?!
Okay, bye!
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Um-hmm.
: Loser?
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
No, I fold.
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
Oh! You are?
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Um-hmm.
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Okay, that is all you.
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Okay, I have a wedgie.
So-so, what do you want for lunch?
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
Oh, I am so sorry.
Smell familiar?
Oh no.
No me, I am so sorry...
Oh my.
Ohh that's great!
Grammy, Best New Artist.
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
Yeah!
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Huh umm...
So it would just be, me alone?
Well, Ben would be there.
What's the matter?
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
Aw, thanks!
Wow. Good speech.
Yeah, it really was!
Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
Yeah.
I know, it's sick.
I know.
He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
Why is it sick?
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Oh, right, that's me!
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Fine.
Is Ross here?
Oh.
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
No he went out to get pizza.
Oh really, OK.
Oh. Stop it!
Okay.
Ross isn't here.
So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
Thank you. Mon?
He's so funny!
Thanks.
Hmm?
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Well, it's about time.
Hi! Bye!
Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final.
Ooh, very official.
Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Yeah? Hi!
Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
You don't know anything.
Are they in love?
I don't know.
Ohh, I know one thing!
What?
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
No, wait Phoebe.
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
You didn't get it?
Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
No.
Why didn't you get it?
Yeah, I'm with Mon.
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
No, I will not cave.
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
Oh, Mon, sure.
It depends on who asked.
What if I asked?
Really?
Yes. You're not asking are you?
Oh.... my God.
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
F-hah.... flennin....
Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Yeah, I can do that.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Hey!
Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
No.
Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
Youre not gonna lose him.
Yeah that works.
Ohh.
Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
They-they-they can smell fear.
Hey!
Absolutely not.
We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Probably just the first half.
Bye hon.
Thank you Rachel.
Bye sweetie.
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Bye house!
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Yeah.
Bye Mon.
Bye.
It-it did!
Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
Sure!
Hey. It happened!
Ohh whoops.
Ohh, sorry.
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
Why the voice.
So talk to her.
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
Hard to say.
Your cappucino sir.
You got fired?!
Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
What?!
Oh my Gosh!
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
There he is!
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Hey!
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Just, y'know out.
Okay? You ready?
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
That's true.
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Hey! We're here!
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
Hey!
Ohh! Oh my God!
Yeah, right. Sure!
Oh. Oh my God.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
It's not Christmas!
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
Or Spin the Bottle?
He's not 11!
Well, it's my cat.
Yeah?
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
What?!
Oh yeah, I got a cat.
Oh, Kim, Hi.
No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Uhh-huh.
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
Well I love you too.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's the first time we've said that.
Yes it is.
It was unbelievable!
Ross kissed me.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
I mean that's unbelievable.
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
How can you not know which one?
I mean, was it Gina?
Which one is Gina?
Oh, I am sorry...
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
You didn't.
I gave you one job!
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Monica! Come on!
All right, fine.
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Oh. Okay, bye.
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
It's for me.
So what are you gonna do?
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
I hope it's okay.
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Oh...
"Happy Birthday Peehe."
Not right now.
Really?
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
Ohhh... I'm fine.
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
To the left, to the left- aww!
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
What's going on?
Hi!
Uh, hey!
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
And an assistant.
I'd need an expense account.
Done!
Sophie, get in here!
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
I don't know, I don't know.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
You have a son!
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer...Pretty?
It's Petty. I'll be right back with your ticket.
I know. I know.
Feel better?
Me neither.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Me too.
Guys, we bought the tickets.
Sophie's desk.
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Noo!
Yay! Emily!
Welcome to America.
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
What are the odds? What are the odds?
Okay, that-that's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
Yeah, she's gay.
Yeah.
I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Hey.
What's the matter?
Gunther, I quit.
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
What?!
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
Ross, you don't know that.
Marcel?
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Oh, Joey! Sorry!
What are you doing?
That doesn't lock does it?
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
Oh, right, clink.
That's just great.
Um, cheers.
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
What's up Joey?
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
That's right.
How you doin'?
Excuse me, is this your car?
Both of you?
Together?
Uh huh.
Yep.
Together.
What?! No! Why?!
Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
You don't even know!
You will like it!
No I won't.
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
Well look, if you don't like this...
What time is it?
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.
One.
One.
Hello, Chip.
Jeez!
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
True story.
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
I thought that was just a rumour.
They're here already?
All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
I, I don't have it.
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
Nobody does honey.
Just a bug.
Oh my God!
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
Okay.
Where you goin'?
Hey, do you guys have... ...hi.
Hi.
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
Oh.
Well, things change.
You really think it would be that different?
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
It'll be okay Joe.
That sounds great.
I don't know, I'm very tired.
So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
What's your problem?
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Pffhah.
Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Is Monica here?
Hey, you guys...
Hey!
No.
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
I won't speed.
Yeah?
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away?
I promise.
That's not European!
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Well, it felt French.
Oh God, I really had a good time!
None for me.
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...
Pepper?
Okay sorry, whew.
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
Any luck?
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
Bye-bye Julie.
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
See you later Rach.
Hey.
Hey.
Meeting Julie.
When you were in China.
China.
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
Are you over me?
Noo! Angels.
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
I'm gettin' my chair back!
What? Wh-hey!
Sure? Thanks.
Okay.
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Monica, where did you get these?!
Um... Done!
Good, good, good, good, good.
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Hey!
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
That's what I said.
No.
No?
Look, maybe we should go?
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
I cannot believe her.
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
You start working on that list.
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
That would be great!
Oh yeah, no, what's that?
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
Yeah, all right, it's a date.
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Yes, and grumpy.
Hello!
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
Well, you should have.
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
But I didn't.
Why?
Because!
What are you saying?
Yeah?
...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
Well, then talk!
No.
I really need to talk to you.
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Yes!
Yeah. That's Daddy.
Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
All right, bye-bye.
Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
We'll give you Janice.
I know, I remember that!
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
I remember you did.
God!! What am I gonna do?!
Are you over me?
Meeting Julie.
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
Apartment pants?
Oh.
And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
Yeah, you never heard of them?
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
Goodbye, baby.
He didn't get the goggles!
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Ciao, bela.
Do they wait for me to do this?
Happy Thanksgiving!
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
Hi Rachel!
You too sweethart!
Hey!
Happy birthday.
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
Hey, you guys.
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
I'm thinkin' no.
Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
A joke they would appreciate?
What did you say?!
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Yeah, I'm just mad!
No Phoebe I am mad!
Well, deep-deep-deep down!
Then keep running.
You win.
And-and what else?
So now what have we agreed?
No more pranks.
That you and daddy were not on a break.
Very good.
Uh... I don't know.
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
Alright. What's the message?
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
What?
She could be you.
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
Okay, I'm not getting this!
Okay. Wait! Wait!
Oh, wait-wait-wait...
You tell them to wait!
Emily.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Ohh that's nice.
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Yeah. Well, umm.....
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
Rach, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thank you, Okay, Okay.
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
Okay, good luck
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Joey, I really don't...
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
Can you tell me how this happened?
Well no.
Oh dear God.
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
She you in the parking lot.
What was the book?
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
The big book of childrens' names.
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
It sure is.
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Beef.
Yeah I think so.
Okay.
Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
I wasn't talking to you.
I'll be okay.
No. Have you?
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
You've never asked a guy out?!!
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
I don't even know how I would go about it.
I don't want to say.
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Whose is it?
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
Diane Keeton.
Oh yeah? Fine.
You are right there with Emily. And it's y'know, it's kinda like.... it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
I gotta get to work.
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
Oh yeah, no, what's that?
Ok. That's fine.
Yeah. Gotcha.
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
So how did you know I was even here?
Your mom called me. So is this her?
Yeah, that didn't work.
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
We use it!!
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
There you go!!
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
Nothing! You go!
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Okay, what's going on with you?
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
I'm just serving it.
Would anybody like more coffee?
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
You are so beautiful.
Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
I really can't slap you.
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
Oh, thank goodness!
Yeah, I...
But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you.
You have a roommate?!
Who's Denise?
My roommate.
Yes, Denise. Denise!
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
How about you guys?
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Where are you going?
Open bar?
I think so.
Aw, Mon...
Oh! I used to do that too!
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Full house.
Good luck.
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
You got me.
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Well, it's nice to know that you...
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Oww!
Oh my God, is that still...
No you're not.
Yes I am!
I would love to!
Hey!
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
Oh good!
Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
No, we never do that
Yeah.
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
Okay, here comes another camera.
Oh, that sounds great.
Oh, you got me.
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
Come on over here, sweetheart.
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
We're the Cobras!
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Yeah! We are!
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
I bet 20.
Hit me!
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
You're right!
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
What?! You kissed!
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Umm, she kissed me.
Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Shhhh!!!
I'm all better now.
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
I helped!
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Oh, the guys are here.
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
this summer?
Work on your music?
Ross! Stop that!
What?
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
Ah, I'm sorry.
Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
Well I've had it.
Oh no.
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
Yeah, I've had it.
Had it.
Some of them.
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
You mean like for award shows?
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Ross, you know what...
Come on you gotta have one!
Nope.
What?
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Well, who wouldn't?!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
Fine, I will.
I didn't know that.
Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
Good, 'cause I love you.
Oh yeah.
Do you know something?
Yeah!
Do you know something?
I might know something.
I might know something too.
Come on Joey!!!
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
I can't believe you would say that!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Okay.
See, this is a great apartment.
Yeah but Phoebe...
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
All right, I like that.
We're not?!
No we're not.
Okay.
So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
It is? Really?
But I...
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
Yeah, sweetie.
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
It's All Relative!!
Uh-huh. Good luck.
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
You don't have to shout everything.
I'm sorry!
Hi! How are you?
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!
We're fine, we're fine.
OK.
Oh come on Ross!!
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
As are you...
I am Father Kalebasous.
He's Greek Orthodox.
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Monica! Stop it!
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Damn! It's empty!
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Right! You're right!
Wow.
Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
Heh... y'know?
You know what?
That is so cool.
No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.
Oh!
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
Yeah! Yeah, we can!
...pig...pig man!
He's like a big disgusting...
...like a...
Yes, good! Ok...
Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Bob Buttons?
Wait a minute. What's his name?
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Exactly! Unisex!
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Since when?
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
What'd you get?
Sorry Jill.
Sorry-sorry Jill.
Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
Oh.
You were with Julie?
What?!
Jody!
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Oh. Oh my God.
What is the emergency?!
Monica what?
What?!
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
I do the same thing.
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th.
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
I went really long.
I love this game!!
Hey, where'd you get that?
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Do what, do what?
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
You can not do this.
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Okay. Every time.
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Yeah.
Oooh, what you got there?
Pastrami.
Really? How good?
Well?
Mmmm! It's good!
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Mmm.
What are you reading?
Hey, Pheebs!
Hey, Pheebs!
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
What are you shushing?
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Shhhh!
We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?
Ahhhh!
To be nice.
What!?
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
No, only for sex.
What's up, Ross?
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Okay...
So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Yeah!
I said I'll do it!
I'll do it.
Who wants it? Anybody?
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
I'm not gonna gooo.
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
You're not going to go.
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
OK, well, bye.
What?
I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.
Goodbye.
Well, bye for me too.
Uh-huh, go on.
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
Tag Jones.
That's it. That's my whole name.
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
So, how are you?
Music. Very nice.
Oh my God!
I am good. I finished my book.
Oh yeah, what's it about?
Well, I-I guess-I...
Yeah! That would be great!
You're into hardcore S&M right?
Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
Yeah, great, you betcha!
Oh, was it awful?
Oh.
It's over.
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
I wrote you a letter.
Oh, somebody will.
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
You're kidding.
Oh, time's up.
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Oh!
I mean, this is unbelievable.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
I know. This is really, really huge.
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Gimme the keys!
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
What?! Give-give me a brush.
No way!
Well no brush!
Well no brush!
Gimme the keys!
No way!
Fine! Y'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
Alimony.
He's not 11!
It's not Christmas!
Or Spin the Bottle?
Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
What? You're leaving?!
Well um, I don't.
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
You really serve people sneezers?
You kids ready?
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
Oh well, no I...
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
I-I-I think you look great.
I thought it was Chandler!
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
What's the matter with you?!
What? What?
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
In a month?
What?!
Yep!
Yeah!
You mean, you mean 30 days?
I'll get the hat.
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Okay.
Oh! It's you. Hi.
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Hey!
Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
Well, what do you mean?
For...me.
Well, not just for you.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Aw, I love that.
And of course, crotchless panties.
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
You guys!
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
Funny book?
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Some day, maybe.
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Smell familiar?
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
What do you mean?
Oh no.
Oh, I am so sorry.
Sophie sit!!
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
No! God, would you just calm down!
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
That was not funny!
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
What did you just say?
I can't believe he did this.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
We didn't change..
Is there somebody else?
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
I'm gonna do it too!
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Me too!
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
Does it hurt?
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Because they're people.
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Why do you care?
But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
What's up Joe?
I know.
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Yeah?
Thank you. I...yeah.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
I mean after tomorrow night.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Oh sure it is!
Ohhhh!! ...What? What?
That's not all.
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Um, what- what would make you think that?
All right? Thank you.
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
All right!
I'll take it back tomorrow.
Thank you.
Hey! What's up?!
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
So all we have is ice?
Ahh. Thank you!
Get up!
Here you go honey!
Diet Coke.
Op, ice. I need ice.
What is that noise?
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
You!
It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
No. No, you can't.
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
What?
Oh I don't-I don't know.
Oh my God, Jill!
Yes?
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Oh my God, Rachel!
Oh my God, introduce us!
That's it. Ow!!!
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Aww, come on.
Oh my God!
Oh-ow!
Pheebs, I was wondering...
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Well, I like you less!
Ow!
Okay, how do you feel now?
Well, this is just as boring in England.
Hey.
Oh, get out of here!
That is not a problem.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Yeah, like a chimney.
I hear you can get people out of here.
Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
Are you wearing my glasses?
Oh-ohh, thank you.
Kinda.
Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Well...
Oh, it's gonna be fine.
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
We're not actors.
How do you do. Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! Did they have representation?
No, they-they weren't in the play.
Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face and her chest I could really put something together.
Could I borrow it?
You don't have birds.
We're not doing anything.
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
I could have birds.
Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
I'd love to!
Okay.
I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
What?
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
Monica, let it go.
What?
Hide the Lamp.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
No! Help me!
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
I don't know sweetie.
I can't! I have to work!
Phoebe?
What? You're leaving?!
He's not 11!
Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
Yes, we have something we have to get to.
Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
Water it is.
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
What's a virgin?
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
You mean the spitter?
Yeah, what's it about?
What 'cha readin'?
The paper.
Events from around the globe.
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
What, what incident?
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.
Do you want a refill?
But I hired you!
Well...
Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
What?
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
Oh, hi Danny.
I hate this thing!
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Was she good?
Uh-oh.
What?
Don't answer that.
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Who's this from?
There is a little child inside this man!
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Oh, that's Ross's.
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
And did you notice...?
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Yeah!
Yeah.
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Oh, that is so sick.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
Great!! That's great!
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Hello, excuse me.
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
Hang on.
What.
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
The end.
Oh, God...
Joey, had reasons.
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
By being in a box?
They were threefold.
Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm... Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
Okay, just sweep it.
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
Sorry, I'm sorry. Close, close, close...
I'm sweeping...
Right.
It's OK, it's fine.
Well maybe he was nervous.
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
KARL!
Wow, is that Michelle?
No, happy for you!
Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you.
Happy for you.
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
Y'know, all the women.
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
What?
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
I'm right here!
Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
Alright, I want my monkey.
No!
Sorry, prom queen.
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Phoebe are you serious?
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Totally.
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
Oh, this is so cute.
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Oh, I got that for him.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Oh-oh, you lie.
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
Yeah, maybe.
What you don't think I'd go up to her?
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
Ohh, what is in that?
Thanks.
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
Monica, what are you doing?
So, are you gonna see him again?
Tomorrow night.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
How's the maniac?
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Honey, I was wondering....
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
Hmm?
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
What-what about Monica?
Awww, just like his daddy.
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Oh, she isn't home.
So it would just be, me alone?
Oh don't even ask!
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Is that a swing?
Yuck!
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Well, what about Mindy?
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
No, it was. It was very very good.
Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
You look so beautiful.
Oh my God Monica!
I wanna wear this everyday.
I'm so happy for me.
Hello?
Okay no, you do it.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
What?
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
And all these people actually died?
That's not the end.
Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
What about the part where he has rabies?
He is so cute!
Where?
Right- where we've been looking all night!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
That'd be good.
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
Rachel.
What were you thinking?!
Or if you prefer, this table is available.
That might be fun.
I didn't know it was an auction!
Wh?!
I had one glass.
I just had a glass.
Two.
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
Gimme a 'Y!'
Gimme an 'L!'
L!
Y!
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Well that was umm...Okay.
That's nice.
Mom, so what did you think?
It wasn't the best.
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
That is not a problem.
Well this is just sad!
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Oh, get out of here!
Allll done!
What are you crazy?!
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
Aww, thank you.
Okay, who's next?!
Beefsteak Charlie's?
Are you sure?
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's...
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Career counselor?
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
I don't!
Diane Keeton.
I don't want to say.
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Do you realize you get louder each week?
Fourth gear!!
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Who?
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
Gooood morning!!
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Hardy Boy.
Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
Spiderman?
Peter Parker.
Thank you.
Here?! Now?!
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Macadamia nut?
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Umm... Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Hm-mmm!
Merrill Lynch?
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
What?!
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Well why didn't you take the job?
Pancho Vila?
Hi!
What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget.
Yeah!
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Rob Tillman!
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
Oh my God! Rachel Green?
No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
Rossy, Rossy.
All right, I'm going. I'm going.
Here we go, here we go.
She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Space cowboy!
Maurice.
Correct, his profession was?
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
Steve... sleeve!
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
OK, noone is named Sleeve.
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
Summer catalogue!
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
Yes, I realise that.
That's the stuff!
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
Uhh.... waitressing?
Hi.
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
Huh, Bob Saget?
Yeah, it's just y'know...
Ohh...
What's the matter? You okay?
Monica said wedding.
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Oh, this is just terrible.
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
He's taking off her coat!
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Oh.
You guys! You guys!
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
They're not true?
Oh my gosh, Joshua!
All those things I said about not being ready...
No, they're-they're all true.
Oh.
How was the beach?
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
Hey!
Nothing, I don't know.
What happened?
What are you guys doing?
Are you funny?
Excuse me?
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Whoa! What?! Why?!
I know.
Okay, I gotta go.
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Here?! Now?!
... the WENUS?
So was it a lot more money?
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Oh. That WENUS.
But what about Phoebe?
What's up?
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Oh yeah surfer?
A lover?
A surfer.
I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
Hey, come on now!
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Stick to your side!
All right, what are we havin'?
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Hi, remember us?
You have not changed!
Yeah, you too.
Mmm hmmm.
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
Let's go to lunch.
Okay. But wait!
What?!
I can't go to lunch!!
Right.
It's kinda slutty.
Well, I-I don't like it.
Really?!
It's yours!
Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut.
Where are you going?
Tyrannosaurus!
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Work people? Nobody told me.
Well, whaddya think?
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Ohh! That's so great!
Oh honey, I'm sorry.
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
I know!
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Oh Ross, you're so great!
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Huh.
Ohhhh
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
That is so unfair.
Does anybody need anything?
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
Ross, what's the matter?
What uh-oh?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Come on, show me.
Monica, is this true?
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
This is not good for my rage.
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Yes it's true.
Just one cheek.
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Just one drink?!
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
Oh-no-no-no-no....
So, where do you want to go?
Hey, you like pizza?
Let me finish.
All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Done!
Oh.
I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Oh that's what you want.
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
OK.
Yes.
Fine.
So this is Brooklyn.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
Okay.
Oh, that is so sweet!
Little village people.
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Yeah, it sure is!
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
They have parasites?
Why?! What is it?
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
Pete?!
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
Oh?!
Oh my God!! Great!
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
Well, I-I don't like it.
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
Really?!
It's kinda slutty.
How did it go?
I'll take care of it.
That's right! You do what the hand says!
I lost our mattresses.
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
Okay. I'll miss you.
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Dope!
Wow, cute one!
How did this happen?
We won. We won!
Mr. Heckles.
He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
That's terrible.
I need some milk.
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Are you okay?
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
Okay, I need a date!
Bye!
Bye-bye!
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
Oh!
That's 'cause you have it.
Well, then...Let's.
I, I just never think of money as an issue.
That's a good point.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
Chandler, what are you doing?
We're with you. We got it.
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Hey. Whaddya doing?
Oh! Oh, God!
Oh I don't-I don't know.
No. No, you can't.
What?
Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
You get your messages!
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Oh. That WENUS.
... the WENUS?
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
So what're you going to do?
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Why? I love that thing.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
You want it?
Oh no.
Is that the heartbeat?
I am a good kisser.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
That's it.
Oh my God!
Oh, hi sweetie.
Oh, please...
Bona sera.
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Last night.
Okay, who's next?!
Allll done!
Aww, thank you.
No-o-o! No way!
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
I'm sorry, let her?
I know that!
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
I need to talk to you!
Hey!
Hello.
Sure, what's up?
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
What did you get her?
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
A pen.
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Oh my God! How?!
Heard what?
Joanna passed away last night.
Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Oh yeah, there you go.
Wow! You made a profit!
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
Yeah?
Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
Yeah?
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Wait, how long?
Wait, what am I gonna do?
You, you go long.
Until we start to look very small.
Okay.
Bathroom's up there.
Hi, I'm Rachel.
Hi.
Great.
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
No luck huh?
Thank you.
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
Yeah, I-I don't care.
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Okay. I-I can't watch.
What 'cha readin'?
Who wrote it?
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
God I know, you're right.
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
I can't, I gotta go.
The balloon?
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Almost never.
Thank God. Food.
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Pizza guy!
Phoebe?
What?
Monica, what should I do?
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Oh, I-I don't know.
Just uh, do the right thing.
What?
Who got married?!
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
You did.
What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
Hey, this is hollow.
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Hmm, how about my azzz?
What?
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
Oh Ross, you're so great.
You do?
I do.
It's never gonna happen.
What?
What are you doing here?
Hey!
Hi!
Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
Oh.
We hate that guy.
I dunno, there's just something about...
Basically we just feel that he's...
Yeah. Hate him.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Thank you! Break!
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
Well that too. Joey?
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Yeah?
Do you want some pancakes?
Oh! No, not really.
dammit!
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Well, that's cool. So did...
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
That had to hurt!
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
There you go!
Chandler! Is he?
Sure!
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
Y'know what you should do?
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Huh?
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
Men are unbelievable.
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
There's nobody here!
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
She's not making me uncomfortable.
I came with Paul!
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
What are you doing here?!
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Get up!
I'm not reading this!
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
This is disgusting!
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
Its still there!
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
I am not a pushover!
That's great. Good for you guys.
I am not high maintenance!
Who said you were?
You did!
It's the same story.
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Wow, it's really long.
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Tell Monica I'm sorry.
What?!
He left that.
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Ohh, I would love too.
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Yeah? Oh-oh, she'd be so excited!
Ohh! Okay!
Seriously, it's moving!
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Oh, it's not!
What the hell is in there?
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Why didn't you get it?
You didn't get it?
No.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
You bought boobs?
You went shopping for fur?
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
You fell asleep?!
What?!!
I fell asleep!
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Well, people are different.
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
What the hell is that?
Okay.
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
C'mon touch it.
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
That's romantic.
No.
Oh, come on squeeze it.
Oh, that must be it.
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Thanks! You too.
You're jokin' right?
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Thank God you're pretty.
Shake it off.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times.
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
Oh my God, what happened?
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
How come you are?!
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
Na-uh, I am!
Because I cared enough to lie!
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
Honey, I'm just checking.
Monica.
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
Oh.
Monica.
Hey, nice toilet.
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?
No no no, behind it.
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Ugh! What grandmother?
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
Okay. Sorry.
Hey! Where have you been?
Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
She's still with you?
If you want.
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
Ohh, you're so sweet!
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
You're so sweet!
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Huh.
No no no no.
Oh, no no no no no.
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
Impressive.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Yeah, fair enough.
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Not to me.
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
Bye Dan!
What's the other one?
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Yeah. Hi Mark!
Yeah.
Rachel?
Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
Oh, I did!
It's a different guy!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
Good evening officer.
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
Oh yeah, go ahead.
Huh.
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Ohh! Me too!
Wow! How are you?!
Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
Is-isn't it the best?
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
Hi! Hi Ben!
Do it again!
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Okay? Whoa, wait!
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Okay.
Good idea!
Yeah, oh wait!
Okay! Okay! Here!
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Rachel, get the book! The book!
The Bible?!
I don't know!
Ross, Joey is not here.
I was just getting him to like you.
Joey?! Joey!!
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Did you talk to him?
Thank you.
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Not yet.
Then, no.
Alright, I got it Ross.
Oh, that's um, interesting.
No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
What?
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
What's the big deal?
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Okay, I'm totally cool!
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Come in.
Hey Jessica.
Right, and the humiliating.
Right.
About the yelling.
Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
Um, hum.
Oh, everything's pink.
Come on, show me.
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Ross gave it to me.
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Ohh, thank you.
What's goin' on?
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
I know! I know! I know!
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Thank you! You're great!
No, you could've lost your job.
Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
Y'know what?
What?
Oh, you go out with him.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Oh, really?!
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
What?! Are you crazy?
And um, what-what is that Ross?
The physical act of love.
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
Are you kidding me?
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Oh, that's um, interesting.
Hi.
I didn't get a cat.
No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
Alright, I got it Ross.
Oh my gosh, Joshua!
Sit!
Hi.
All those things I said about not being ready...
They're not true?
Wait, are you leaving?
Thank you.
Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Hey Joey, can I...
Okay, here we go.
All right everyone, lift! And slide!!
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
So umm, does it?
You just finished?
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
I'm sorry.
Does it?
Ugh! So close!
Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
Hey you guys! Look!
Hey!
Would you guys stop.
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
It's my TV.
Wha-, oh, quit it.
Okay, here we go...
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
There. Now there is.
Oh, I would love to!
We did!
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
Yay, okay!
Good, good, good, good, good.
Well, what is the truth?
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Yeah, what's going on?
What's going on?
Ooh, okay... good.
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
What is this place?
Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
Honey, that's you're name.
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
Aww, Pheebs.
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Hey! You're wearing pants!
Really? You think so?
Uh-oh.
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
I was talking to myself! You're going down!
You're straight. I get it.
Wh-what do you mean?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Honey, this will help.
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Uff.
All right, let's go!
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
All right Pheebs, your cab's ready.
You're welcome.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
Why, why not?
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Because it's too delicious.
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
And she's not crazy?
Yeah.
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Oh my God.
I'm going for a walk.
Like a log.
Us too.
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Hey, what happened to you?
Let's do it! Ross?
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
Yay!!
What?
Do you wanna play football?
Wow! How are you?!
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
Yeah. Right.
Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
Ohh! Me too!
Oh, I can't watch this.
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
Really?!
We need a hat..
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
I can't kiss anyone.
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
So I'm kissing everyone?
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Yeah, I don't think so Joe.
I wrote you a letter.
Oh, was it awful?
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Well look who's here!
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Oh. Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
A big idiot.
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
I'm just making margaritas.
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
Okay.
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
I guess you weren't there.
You remember when we got these?
No.
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
Eh! Stop it!
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Okay, I'm the baby.
Hey!
Chandler! What are you doing here?
A birthday party.
Oh no.
What party?
Who's birthday party?
Allison's birthday party.
What does she mean?
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
It's coming from Joey!
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
Good. How are you?
Hey, you.
How are you?
Good.
Hi, honey.
So what are you gonna do?
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
When did this happen?
Somebody got in late last night.
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
Was that the cake?
SURPRISE!!!
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
I'll call the super.
Well put it back.
It uhh, it won't go back.
Here, let me try.
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Why?! Why not?!
Wh-what did he say?!
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
What did you say to him?
I'm just cleaning up.
The lights, please..
...How long was I in there?
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
One two three.
Rock-paper-scissors?
Yeah.
Yeesss.
Fine, go have sex.
God. I feel violated.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Ross, ten o'clock.
Stevie the TV?
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
Is there a problem?
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
Not in the street!!
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
Okay!
Yes!
Hi.
Really? Mine too.
So, uh, how was your day?
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
Hey cool, mine too.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got to get to the museum. So um, I'll see you tonight.
Ross, it's too hard.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
Ross, you're like my best friend.
Good luck Chandler.
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Thank you Rachel.
Bye sweetie.
Oh.. a little..
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Mm-hmm..
A lot.
Oh my God! What happened?
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Sixty guests.
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Where ya going?
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Ohh, with who?
Where did you get that?
And that makes you angry because...
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Phoebe?
Well honey, what about you?
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Yeah.
What?
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Yeah, umm, no honey.
Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
That wouldn't help me.
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
Ohh, yes it would.
I've had a really good time tonight.
Well thank you, you too.
Hi!
Wow! Happy Monica's night!
Thanks.
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
By all means.
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Here's your lemonade.
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
I didn't order lemonade.
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
Oh I get it! A...man...duh!
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
I'm Amanda.
Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Doctor Ross Geller.
Oh yes! Thank you!
We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
What?
No, wait. Wait.
Hi.
All right, I guess we should go.
Oh yeah right!
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
For Ross, Ross, Ross.
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
For Ross.
Oh my god.
Hey.
Great! Monica's moving!
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
Hey, how are you guys doing?
I am not!
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Wow! What's that like?
Please!
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
It's like this, me, no jokes.
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
And, I'll be nice.
I won't boss you around.
And you'll be nice?
And you'll be topless?
And-Joey!
I think they're very nice.
Auntie Monica!!
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
I like 'em.
Yeah!
I love it at Joey's!
They're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules.
Really? Its not just frowned upon?
Hey, here you go.
Ni-hi-ice!
Oh, okay, not so weird.
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
I was in charge of cups.
Hey!
Hey.
We'll take Literature!!
Althea is correct.
Nice shooting!
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
Come on, show me.
Ross, what's the matter?
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Oh, everything's pink.
Yes, I realize that...
Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
I love working with designers!
I might know something too.
Do you know something?
I might know something.
What's the thing you know?
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
I'm not in love with Ross!
Still in love with?!
Yeah!
Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
How many you want?
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
I'm in.
One.
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
Well, they always called.
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
Hmm, bite me.
Did he call?
Ben just said hi.
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
Wha, what?
What, the word hi?
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
I am so on board!
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
Absolutely!
Rachel didn't you just light that?
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
You stole the phone!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Ooh, now you lost me.
No I didn't!
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
Oh, honey that's awful.
What's that?
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
But, it's not raining.
Ow. Ow. Ow.
You flicked me first.
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Closer than here?
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle.
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Ethan called again.
Mon!
What?
Oh.
Are you not seeing him anymore?
Oh? Yeah! Sure!
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Hey, do you have any gum?
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Oh there is no way.
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Yeah.
Okay then.
Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
Hey guys! What's...
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Ahhh.
Ross, I really don't think...
Oh!
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Lift!! And slide!
Okay, here we go.
Nobody does honey.
I, I don't have it.
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
Hi.
Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
What 'cha readin'?
Yeah, I-I don't care.
Okay. I-I can't watch.
The paper.
Yeah, what's it about?
All right, let's do it.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
Come on!
Okay.
It's not a big deal!
Wow!
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
They were lovers.
What?!
Oooohh that's interesting.
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
Throw in the duck too!
Ohhh, yeah, me too.
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
No! Wait! Come on!
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
No you guys...
Yeah, you should, really.
Just go for it Chandler.
Yeah, you should.
Go on.
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Oh, making it worse!
I don't know.
Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning.
Okay.
So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
You found my book?!
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Where do you think, Zelda?
Yeah I did!
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
And you know Monica and Ross!
This is Chandler.
Hi!
Hi Jill.
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
Oh, he sees her!
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
Oh, he's catching up to her!
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
What thing? What thing?
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
Oh, it was, nah, well....
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
This place is amazing.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
I-kea! This is comfortable.
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
I know.
What? You didn't get one.
Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
Yes.
OK, well then what is this?
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
Here are your cakes.
I'll take it. My gift to you man.
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
We didn't order cake.
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
Oh no, you're the best.
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Gimme an 'I!'
Gimme an 'M!'
M!
I!
Gimme an 'L!'
Gimme an 'L!'
Gimme an 'I!'
I!
L!
Gimme a 'Y!'
Gimme an 'M!'
Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'
E!
M!
Gimme an 'I!'
Oh, this one's for me!
What?
Alright, no, we could look at them!
Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
Oh great!
Oh yeah, I got a cat.
Well, it's my cat.
What?!
I don't want a cat!
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
Not after this!
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
Oh b-b-but it is!
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
I don't know if it's true.
Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
What?! What? What happened?!
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
Yeah!
Pretty well, actually...
Hey! Hi!
How'd he take it?
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
Oh, do I?
Yeah. Nice try!
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
I loved them!
Hello!
Hey!
Hey! What's up Mon?
Hey!
Hey!
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Have at it.
Better than Chandler.
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Oh I know.
What happened?!!
Well, I don't know!!
No. Well, yeah, maybe.
Uh-huh.
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
What's 1922?
What are you gonna do Pheebs?
And I have costumes.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
And say nothing?
Oh, what a fun office.
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Ohh, hi, Kim.
No thanks, Josephine.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Hi Rachel.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
What is she doing here?
Hello, Rachel.
Well, not at first.
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Yeah! I got my girls.
Yeah.
You okay?
Ugh.
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
You found me a guy?
What?
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
You're not an artist.
What?
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Ok, who ordered what?
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
You brought a carrot?!
What?
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
Monica's making jam.
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
What is this? Fruit?
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Because the kids need new shoes.
Joey! Sit down!
What?! I don't have 20,000!
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
Forget her! You enjoy this!!
What are you doing?
Oh, yeah go ahead.
Hi.
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
No. No.
Barry who I almost.
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Barry who you almost...?
And Mindy, your maid of...?
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
Uh, credit card.
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
How'd you pay for them?
And who pays for that?
Um... my... father.
Is-is he coming?
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
No that's my assistant.
Umm, no.
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
I'm going commando, too.
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
What?
Awwww!!!
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
Hey Rach!
What was that?!
It's Le Poo.
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
I can't believe it! We're here!
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
For what?
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
It's really not that big!
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
Takin' that with you, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Ohhhh, come on!!!
So....
No.
I think she's here.
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
Okay. I am so hot!
You just asked me.
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
A thousand bucks.
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Yeah? How much?
ON A CAT??!!!!
It's not a cat!
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
I need to talk to you!
Sure, what's up?
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
What?! We can't do that!
I know!
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
What bank is this?
Hey, Pheebs.
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
It's Alan.
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
It doesn't say that. Does it?
Oh-hooo, I missed you.
Hey! Me too!
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
I missed you too.
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
Ohh, not compared to you.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
And Milton Berle has a...
Well?
They're not even touching the lasagna!
Said what? Exactly.
My drinking?
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Did uh, Ross call?
Hey.
Hey.
No, I'm sorry.
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
Yeah! That would be great!
No! Nothing!
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
You're into hardcore S&M right?
Well, I-I guess-I...
Well, what about my stuff?
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
You don't have any stuff.
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
Yes! Did you see that?
Let go!
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
I could not have done this without you.
Well, Ross said my name.
Hi!
Hi, so what happened?
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
Yeah.
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
...it's gonna be okay!
Okay, uh...
I've got cold feet.
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
Oh, well...
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Because, he's my friend.
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
I wanna say a disease.
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
So what was it for anyway?
Hey!
Hey!
With Ross and Jill?
What?!
Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
Yeah!
With Ross and my sister?
Because, he's my friend.
Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Sure, is she married?
Man, I gotta get a kid.
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
Ahh, no.
Oh.
No you don't know why!
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
I know why!
Okay! Why?!
Because! Because I was sad.
Very nice touch.
Come on baby, come on!
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.
Unbelievable.
Okay, let me just change.
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
Thank you.
Yes.
Hey.
Joey! Joey, good one!
I think it was valued at 19,000
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
That's good. Very good!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Don't call us that!
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Hi! How are the Gellers?
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Hey! It's Porsche!!
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Yeah!
You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
Thank God you're pretty.
You're jokin' right?
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Hey!
Hi! Hey!
Stop picturing it!!
Hey!
Hey Rach.
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Yeah? You like that one?
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
That's a good one.
Yeah, you're funny.
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Are they in love?
Is he romantic with her?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You don't know anything.
But, it's not raining.
Oh, honey that's awful.
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
I can't catch a break!
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
What the hell was that?!
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Ross!!!
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Ohh, you're a freak!!
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
All the time?
All the time!
Still crying?
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Uhh, hang in there?
Oh, that's sweet.
You're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
I have absolutely no idea.
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
That's... that's classic.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
What? Guys, I'm not.
Okay.
When are you coming home?
C'mon, this is us.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Well, I just called Joshua...
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
Plus, you look cool.
Oh, how did it go?
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
Yeah, great, you betcha!
Well, I-I guess-I...
Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
I almost forget the tickets, didn't I?
What?
We were on a break!
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
No! They are mine!
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Gimme 'em!
You stole them from me!
You stole them from me!!
Yeah, I don't think so Joe.
Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Oh, ah with who?
Yeah.
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
Huh. A moo-point?
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
No way, forget it.
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
C'mon, she's your mom!
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Hey, guys, what's up.
You had a salad.
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
Hi, how was the movie?
Hi.
...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Wonderful!
So good!
What's the matter with you?
Who said it was for you?
Hhhiiii.
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Noo.
D'oh!! I've got it!
Yeah!!
No!
You don't have it.
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
Well, thank you, Melanie.
Think about it.
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
OK, this one right here is from me.
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
All right, I got 48.
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Oh, okay, time's up!
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
Oh yeah, sure, that too.
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
Or incredibly offensive.
What?
All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
Ooh, it was only okay.
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
Y'know, I never saw that.
Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
Hi!
Really?! How do you know?
Hey!
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
Oh, I'm sorry.
OK, that's dead right?
We won't?
C'mon.
What is this? What are we doing?
Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
Op! You're peeping!
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Okay Rach, but...
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
Look I told you...
So, how was the party?
That's too much. Sorry.
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
And thank you for your time.
Yeah!
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
His new girlfriend!
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
What is that?
I think it's the dying cat parade.
I'll figure something out.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
All right. Good luck.
Thanks.
Close call day.
Well, there you go!
Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Hey, thanks Rach.
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
What-what-what are you gonna do?
She wants me to move to London.
But you live here! You know that.
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Oh yeah, what's it about?
So, how are you?
I am good. I finished my book.
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Yeah, I do.
Hey, how'd it go?
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Hey!
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Do you want my pickle?
Yes?!
I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
Hey guys.
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Joey, do you have a minute?
What difference does that make?!
Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Dude, what am I gonna...
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
What? C'mon, talk to me.
Sure.
Naa.
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
No-no, I bought those.
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Yeah.
Oh, youre gonna be great!
This is just occurring to you?
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Because I'm going to London.
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
Oh, I know. Look at him.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
He is so amazing.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
Thank you. Oww!!!! God!
Okay.
Okay?
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
I know! I know! I know!
Monica, you asked the question.
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Good luck, honey!
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Bye!
Hey, uh, Joey?
And I will see you tomorrow!
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
They're still just friends, right?
That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Ahhh! Ooh, nice!
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
My God!
What do you think you're doing?!
Fine! We went out.
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Then tell him quickly.
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Hey. Got a second?
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
Nooo!
Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...
Hello, sweetheart.
Oh, can we read them?
Oh!
Hey!
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Okay.
Run Phoebe run.
No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
Hey, hey, no, oh oh.
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
And the sex?
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
I did not sell you out.
That is the most ridiculous.
You sold me out.
Yes you did. Absolutely.
Would you let me talk.
You're bachelor pad?!
What do you say?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
Have you even had a girl up here?
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
Oh, that's me.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
You said she was bald.
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Thanks! You too.
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
Hel-lo, Rachel Green.
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Excuse me. It's about the job.
What are you going to make?
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Yummy noises.
And Monica, what are you going to make?
It's Robert Bobby.
And his first name.
He's Bobby Bobby?
Oh.
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
I bet you're a Gemini.
Yeah.
You're an Aquarius, huh?
Nope.
Taurus?
Well, yeah, this is the deal.
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Um, Russ, you ready?
Do you guys want these?
Yeah.
Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
Yeah!
Yeah we do!
No, no, ACC-cept that.
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
E-except, except that what?
Oh.
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
Ohhhh!! ...What? What?
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
That's all!
That's not all.
Oh sure it is!
Well where's Amanda?
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
No, sorry.
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
No luck huh?
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
What're you doing?
Uh, I'm holding Ben.
Does it still hurt?
Oh, are you sure you're ok?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
I won't boss you around.
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
You won't boss me around anymore?
And you'll be nice?
And, I'll be nice.
Hello! Here we go!
What!!?
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Okay, see? I told you!
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
That was unbelievable!
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Not at all inappropriate!
Excellent!
Very informative!
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
That was great, the kids loved you.
Eh, do you believe that?
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
Yeah?
So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
What are you playing with?
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
I could do that.
Oh, it's my new beeper.
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
A couple of bucks.
Uhh, we still need a tip.
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
Wow!
So were done then!
Hey!
I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Okay.
On TV?! Yeah!
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
'Kay!

And the Soapie goes to......Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless!
Ohh, well you got 'em.
Yeah!
Yeah we do!
All right!
Just give us our apartment back!
I can't believe this is happening.
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
Well, we could count again.
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
I do.
Ehh, pardon me?
...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.
You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I'm afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
But he has to know how I feel!
Let me get my coat.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
Sorry!
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
...Jack from downstairs?
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
You are just like Jack.
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Ah, the other Jack.
Thank you. What a bitch.
No thanks.
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Joey, why would you do that?
What happened?
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Because they wanted me to audition!
You! An actor?! That's madness!
Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
Oh man!
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
OK, gook luck.
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
Wha, uhh, what?
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
Pheebs, I have to ask you...
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
You're just staring into space.
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
Oh my God.
Hello darling.
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
Give it here. Oh, God.
Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
Yeah.
Okay.
Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
Oh yeah, no, what's that?
Oh yeah? Fine.
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
That would be great!
I'm an assistant buyer!!
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
Phoebe, wait a minute!
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
Yeah, all right.
Chandler, what did she say?
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
Chandler!
Wait a minute.
Come here.
Ohh that'd be great!
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, what is it?
It's a, it's a cat!
What-what is it?!
What the hell is that?!!
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
Yes it is!
Oh, come on squeeze it.
C'mon touch it.
No.
No.
Rub it.
Well there's an idea!!
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Maybe you could be my roommate!
Yeah!
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
Here you go. Thank you!
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
I guess so.
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Then what's gonna happen?
Two, two babies?
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
Uh-huh.
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
Third door on the left.
Right!
Hey.
What are you doing?
Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
What's happening to your accent?
It won't come off!
All right, it won't come off!
What?!
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Yeah, you're on your own.
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
Music. Very nice.
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
I guess they're back from their date.
Oh my God!
So, how are you?
I don't have ten minutes!!
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
What is he doing here?!
Hey!!
Hi!
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
No! Come on!
Do you have any ice?
Hey.
Hey.
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Wow! What did he say?
Never mind, I got it.
And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Yes! Hell yes!
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
All right then, it's settled.
Okay.
How are you holding up?
Hey!
Hey.
Not bad.
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
Hey guys! What's up?
I never knew that either.
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
Heyyy.
We're hanging out.
Little village people.
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
Oh, that is so sweet!
Wait, what am I gonna do?
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
You, you go long.
Wait, how long?
We're gonna find love!
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
It's okay, I got a plan.
Definitely!
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
And everybody knows this?
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Well neither do I!
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Is this about Mark?
Oh my God.
Afraid to ask him?
Come on, like you never talk that.
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Could not be more terrified.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
I'll be out in a second.
Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
Rach?
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
Ooh, I've been better...
Hey.
You all right?
Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Oh, Ross...
Two, two babies?
You think about stuff like that?
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
Then what's gonna happen?
Um, Russ, you ready?
Well, yeah, this is the deal.
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Yeah.
Bye.
Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Hey!
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
I know!
I didn't realize that she was so close.
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
You don't have any secrets!
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Good luck to ya!
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
Well hello! I'm Ross!
Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here.
Wow!
Well I. . .
What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.
Oh, she does want to.
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
No! I do want to!
She does want to.
Yeah!
That is the most ridiculous.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
You sold me out.
I did not sell you out.
I've never wanted you more.
Cut it out.
Mi-mi-mii.
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
Hello.
Oh! Oh, I love that but.
Oh.
But...
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Yeah.
Just get out! Now!!
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
No!!
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Okay! All right! How was she?
It's me! Good morning!
Could there be more Kims?
Who's out there?
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
Well I-I-I'm not moving.
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
Well believe it baby!
What?!
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Care for a cherry?
Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
Hi!
Oh, no thanks.
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
Wait a minute!
Oh yes!
Oh yes! Oh yes!
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Wow! What do you do now?
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
I'm a party planner. I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay!
What are you guys doing here?
Oh my God!
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
The lights, please..
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
...How long was I in there?
I'm just cleaning up.
Well I-I think your wrong.
But he has to know how I feel!
But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
Oh-no.
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
I hate when Ross is right!
Yeah.
Thank you.
He is right, isn't he?
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
Who are these men?
Oh.
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Men. I guy I know.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Do we have to tell her?
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Yes, we have to tell her!
Oh, but it's made her so happy.
Allison's birthday party.
A birthday party.
Who's birthday party?
Oh, and how is Allison?
32.
Well, so what're you gonna do?
But you already told me everything.
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Monica, I'm your best friend.
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Thank you.
Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.
Ross!
Hey! So, did you quit?
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
Hey.
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
So, how was your date?
Oh my God! What happened?
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Um-hmm.
Um... my... father.
Uh, credit card.
And who pays for that?
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
Come on you gotta have one!
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
No.
Nope.
Ross, you know what...
When you were in China.
Chandler told me.
Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
China.
Meeting Julie.
Oh, they're firemen guys.
See, there you go, the cleansing works!
They're nice guys.
You guys tell them you were married?
No way!
So what happens next?
What?
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
God that is good TV.
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
Rob Tillman!
No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!
No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
Op! We gotta go!
The young hot ball and chain.
That's much better.
Oh, where are you guys going?
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
OH MY GOD!!!
Oh my God!
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
You said she was bald!!
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
You said it was okay!
What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
Ugh, she is a slut!
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Who? Is that your sister?
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
Okay! Check it out!
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
Yeah!
What-what is it?!
What the hell is that?!!
Sophisticated like a hooker?
Blow it.
Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Hey!
Hey!
Would you let me talk.
I did not sell you out.
Yes you did. Absolutely.
Did you just flick me?
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Can I see that for second.
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Yeah.
Okay. Hut! Hike!
Ohh we're not sailing.
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Just pull on it.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
Do you want some pancakes?
Well that too. Joey?
Yeah?
Finally!
What are we gonna do?
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Do either of you have the keys?
The oven is on.
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Well then get it, get it!
Hmmm... this is so nice.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
OK.
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
I'm already here.
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Do you want me to quit?
She's not making me uncomfortable.
Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
What?! What would make you think that?
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
Oh, look at the little cat!
Ohhh!!!!
Yes, yes, that's right...
What? Ow!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Well, so what does he do?
Op, I like credit cards!
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Your company has a fine foods division?
How did you make $17.
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
How come those?
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
Nooo!!
So, um, did she...
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
Twice.
Twice?
No. She doesn't die.
What?!
Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
Then why would you say that?!
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
That's not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Who is being loud?
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
I warned you...
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
No! Not at all!
No?
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
What? They were like this!
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay! Hey!
Is Joey Tribbiani here?
Hi Ross!
Hey Rachel.
Umm, no.
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
Ohh, that is soo sad.
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
But you could teach us.
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
No.
No.
OK, so now we draw cards.
Monica, what are you talking about?
What?!
Hey, here's a thought.
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Ahh, third base.
Yeah, he broke those too.
He broke that.
Well, he had gravity boots.
So he likes to break stuff.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
All right.
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
I love working with designers!
Yes, I realize that...
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
Hey! My first review is out!
And the video camera?
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
That makes sense!
Uhh, Monica?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Hi, thanks for coming.
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Somebody called about a monkey?
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
What 'cha doing Mon?
Yeah.
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
What are they?
What'cha gonna' do?
You mean hardball?
Whatever.
Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Uh-huh, what?
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Just get away from me!
What, what are they talking about?
Rachel?
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
This is totally your fault!
Maybe because you've got the keys?
Porsche.
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
Awful, absolutely awful.
Okay, seriously, what do you think?
You look like a freak.
What are you, what are you doing?
It's my New Year's resolution!
So, will you talk to him?
Yeah. Sure.
Can you people not see me?!
I don't know Rach.
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
What? Wait, what?
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Uh-huh.
Ive never done that.
No, yeah, Ive done that.
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
Im sayin I see a difference.
Oh, hi! How are you doing?
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
It's up to you.
I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Oh.
All right. Be sexy.
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
Please.
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
Uh, I'm holding Ben.
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
What're you doing?
Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
Ok.
Hey! What's goin' on?
So who made her queen of the world?
I would love that job!
Hey!
Jill! Did you shop?!
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
What happened? What happened?!
You kissed my girlfriend!
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?

So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
That is lucky.
More than jewelry.
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
Women really want this?
Hi.
Phoebe!
I'm gonna get back to retraining.
Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
All right, see you guys.
Look out kids, he's coming!
Phoebe, come on that's silly.
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
All right, so let's switch.
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm...
Done.
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
Wh-what's that?
It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
Who's this from?
Oh, that's Ross's.
All right, I'm outta here!
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Hi Rachel!
You think about stuff like that?
What?
What?
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
Two, two babies?
Wait, so, you're going?
Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
I'll be right down.
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
OK, OK.
Oh my God! Are you serious?!
What?!
What?
Uh-huh.
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Oh... Italy, I think.
Look at that!
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Is he okay in there?
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
He's fine!
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Would you like some pancakes?
Hi.
Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
...Come on! Why are we here?!
Okay, okay take a guess.
Jill! Did you shop?!
Hey! What's goin' on?
Hey!
No! They did!
Yeah, we went shopping!
OK, ready when you are.
Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
Ahh.
Okey-doke.
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
No that could kill her.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Well, we don't want that.
No so we're protecting her.
Okay. We'll be right back.
Phoebe! That's a great name.
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
Why aren't you at work?
Mon. Hi!
Hi.
Oh, they-they sent me home.
Why?
Oops sorry, my mistake.
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
That's Hanson.
Dear Lord!!
Wow!
Well, well I can up with it!
Relaxi-Taxi!
The name was my favourite part!
YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
Well, I...
Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
That's okay.
You sure?
There. Now there is.
Okay, here we go...
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Uh, four.
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
No! I'm not okay!
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
All right!
Come on! Here.
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Oh, wait-wait-wait...
I was just getting him to like you.
Joey?!
Hi Ross.
Joey?! Joey!!
Ross, Joey is not here.
No-no, but I support it.
It's a uh, regatta gala.
Really! You-you sail?
Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night.
Okay.
Sure. You got it. Great!
Yes.
I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London-well Shropshire really but y'know-well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening?
Oh, good.
Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-
Because a car backfired?
Really?!
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Okay, why are you here?
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
Who are you going out with?
Oh, is this the bug lady?
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
So what are you guys going to do?
That is the most ridiculous...
I KNEW IT!!!!
You had no right to go out with him.
You sold me out.
I did not sell you out.
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
...Dinah?
You didn't.
Oh, I am sorry...
I also said number one.
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
You said number two.
I know.
Hey! Everyone.
Who gave you that hickey?
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
That would be the work of a Blowfish.
Oh!
You seem to really like her.
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
What do you mean?
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Ooh, the gift shop!
Yeah.
Where do you want to start?
Yeah!
Hey, and then lunch.
Why, where are you going?
No-no, I'm staying put.
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
I don't know.
Hey Rach!
Oh my God! Look at this!
No-no-no, no!
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Oh, are you sure you're ok?
Are you sure?
No.
Yeah.
Does it still hurt?
Noo way, Kevin.
And there is Kevin.
Can we please turn this off?
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Are you intrigued?
So all we have is ice?
Hey! What's up?!
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
See if he has ice.
Okay.
What happened to uh, MEG.?
How come those?
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
That is so not my motto.
With Ross and my sister?
With Ross and Jill?
Yeah!
Yeah.
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Hi!
Hey! Hiya!
Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
Oh! Ow!
I almost caught that one!
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Over here!
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
Well, what are you going to wear?
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
Huh. Does Monica know about this?
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Exactly! Unisex!
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Who is it?
Now I love you even more.
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
Surprise.
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
So what-what is the exhibit.
Great.
Yeah.
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Oh man!
I didn't... I never said that.
No.
'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
Okay, I'm sorry.
Huh, Bob Saget?
Uhh.... waitressing?
Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.
Oh, my, oh!
In Human Resources!!!!!!
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Who?!
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
What?!
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
Where ya going?
Oh, it ended very well.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Oh.
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
I haven't seen it yet!
What was that?!
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Noooooooo!!
I think he's stealing from me.
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
What?
Why?
Because he's stealing from me!
Its back in cage!
I got it!
Is it back in the cage?
Cage closed?
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Well why shouldn't I?!
Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.
Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Because it's my apartment!
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
What? Why? Where are you?
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
Damnit!
I'm still on the set!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Well that's his last name.
Uh.
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
And his first name.
He's Bobby Bobby?
It was nice to meet you.
Bye Ryan.
Pleasure.
Take care.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
That's a good call. Right.
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
May fifth, why?
Yeah?
When's your birthday?
Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.
Oh, mine's December...
Uh, yeah, if you want too.
Hey.
May I come in?
Do you want me too?
Yeah, sure?
I can't believe you would say that!
Come on Joey!!!
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
What, isn't he sober?
What's the matter?
It's Fun Bobby.
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Ohhh, OK.
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
You're all invited to bite me!
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Wait! Okay!
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Ohh! My God! Barry!!
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Then how come it is?
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
They've been quiet for a long time.
Maybe she killed him?
Go on! Go on.
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
He took off?
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
Chandler?
Well that sounds fun too.
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Have you ever been with a woman?
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Still in love with?!
I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
Yeah!
I'm not in love with Ross!
Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
Because, uh-it has to.
You have all the answers, don't you?
Hey, thanks for talking to me.
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
They're male nurses.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Oh my!
Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
What is the matter with you?!
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
I didn't. I got under him.
Yeah.
How'd you get over that teacher?
Problem solved.
Bye Phoebe.
Yeah, what the hell did I know!
I really think you need to go now.
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Really? Me?
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
Oy.
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
He's like a big disgusting...
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Oh he's like a...
...like a...
...pig...pig man!
There's more alcohol, right?
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
How you doin'?
Ok.
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
Why aren't you home yet?!
Is someone there?
What are you doing here?
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
Well what happened at dinner?
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
My God! What did you order?!
Something to do with numbers?
Yeah, I actually don't know...
Good, so do I
Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God.
What?
Ooh, let's open them!
Oh great!
And the big one's for me!
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Hee hee!
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
They have that on the napkins at the club.
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
No-no, it's really not huge.
No!
Oh no!
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
Did you know he was in there?
Hmm.
Hey.
No.
How long have we been home?
Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
Some days it's all I can think about.
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
What'd I say?
Hm-m.
I really think you need to go now.
I think you should go.
What?
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Oh my God, honey that's great.
Oh, hi.
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
I know. I just can't find...
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
The bll is drrbing!
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
What?
In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
This is disgusting!
I'm not reading this!
OK, OK, it's my turn.
That's a bird?
That's a bird!
Go.
Uh.... bean! Bean!
Now, does it really matter?
After!!
Before!!
Yes!!
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
No.
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
Yeah?
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Chandler.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Well, what is the other reason?
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
I don't want to say.
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
This time it's not so funny.
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
You're not laughing.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Just stop it! Come on!
Chandler!
Me too! Me too! Me too!
You okay there man?
Yeah, I got too excited!
...I mean it's my fault.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Ohh.
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Oh my God!
Then why do you ask?!
One hour.
Give me two.
Okay, wish me luck.
Okay. I'm going with you.
Oh! I used to do that too!
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Aw, Mon...
So what's going on with you?
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
And while we're on the subject of news..
Ow, you stop flicking.
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Quit flicking
You flicked me first.
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
OK, well, bye-bye again.
Goodbye.
Well, bye for me too.
OK.
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
What?
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Oh, you're welcome a million.
Awww.
Thanks a million.
Okay, I'll see you in our room.
Yeah.
I mean you definitely should do that.
Really?!
Yeah!
Y'know what, I should do it.
Yeah!
He carries a briefcase.
Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
And processing.
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
I cannot push it in!
So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
Okay, okay, okay.
Because! Because I was sad.
No you don't know why!
Okay! Why?!
What do you mean?
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Yes, you're having a boy!
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Wha-
I don't know. The left one.
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Which ones?
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Joey! We should just switch.
You're welcome.
Ross!
Yeah absolutely!
Yeah.
Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Janice is gonna go away now.
I'll be right back.
Whoa.
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
This is just occurring to you?
I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
Im gonna be a father.
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
Oh, youre gonna be great!
It's so secluded up here.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
I know. I like it up here.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Then...who did?
Uh-huh.

It's a uh, regatta gala.
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Yeah, what's the gala for?
Really! You-you sail?
No-no, but I support it.
Yeah, don't push it though.
And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
"Oh, my, god."
We'll give you Janice.
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Good, you guys are all here!
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
I take it.
Hey! What's up?
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
She lets you borrow them.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Are you gonna let me play?
I can not believe your trading me!!
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
All right then.
The game is over, we eat now?
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Does anybody need anything?
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
That is so unfair.
Well, how did you find out?
No.
Yes.
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
So what're you gonna do?
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
You're so sweet!
Ohh, you're so sweet!
Just washing the windshield.
My God!
What do you think you're doing?!
There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
Oh.
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Honey, we have been through this before!
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Well you did a little bit.
I totally forgive you!
Really?
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
What?! What?!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
Oh my God, you're back!
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Okay, errrr, Monica?
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Hi.
Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.
Yeah, I forget which ones.
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
No thanks.
Oh, that's great. Look at that.
Ah here, we brought wine.
Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
It's uh...
I think he's across the hall.
Hey. Where's Joey?
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
Thanks.
There y'go.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Hi!
So you like the short hair better.
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
Well now what's the rush?
Oh for cryin' out loud!
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Oh. Hey!
Who are you supposed to be?
Oh good.
Hello, Zelda.
The vicar!
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Third door on the left.
Right!
Oh, no no no no no.
OK.
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
No no no no.
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
Oh...
You ok?
Yep!
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Huh. All right.
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Ahh, to be 13 again.
Yeah.
Yeah. A year ago..
I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Well that's great! Congratulations!!
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
Because I lose her stuff!
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Why not?
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
We won. We won!
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Mr. Heckles.
How did this happen?
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
Close call day.
Hey, thanks Rach.
Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Oh?
What?! You say that to kids?!!
Ugh!
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
Ha, I made you look....
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
And your fly's still open...
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Monica, in or out?
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
It's kind of an important one!
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
That-that's bad?
What do you, what do you mean?
Ugh...
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
Surprise...
No! I'm so happy for them!
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
Not that often!
Me too! So happy for them!
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.

You betcha!
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
No. She doesn't die.
Then why would you say that?!
Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
Oh my....
Ahh, so do you, beautiful.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Oh, you look so great.
Oops.
What?
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
Okay, quick and painful.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
What the hell are doing?!!
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Dude! He's right there!
Yeah, and not a very good one.
What the hell are you doing?!
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Will you-will you please?
Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
Did you just break the radiator?
Ross, the heat!
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Well put it back.
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Oh, howd she take it?
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
What for?
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Monica! Come on!
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
How much did I love The King and I?
Chandler!
Thank you. So are we good?
You know.
I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
We're good.
We're good?
Well, I'd have to say gay.
Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Yeah? Why?
Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
I didn't know there were docks.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Hey.
Hey.
Honey that sounds like fun.
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
We did?
You owe me 20 bucks.
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
What?! Are you crazy?
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
What?! You got us evicted!!
What a minute, what did he say?
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
I told you not to go down there!
Well he made Rachel cry!
Just sit over there!!
Okay, go to the left. The left!
Huh?
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
Surprise!!
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
You really didn't know?
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
What is it?
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Tag? Hi, who was that?
You! An actor?! That's madness!
Rachel Green's office.
Nobody. I was just practicing.
Really?
No, God! Please, let me!
What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
I'll get it.
Hey!
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
My God! What happened to you?
Yeah, well, is that better?
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
What thing? What is this thing?
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Oh my God!
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
Okay, okay. I hate this.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
Why?
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
Hey guys!
What? What?
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Her dancer friends?
And who else is going to be there?
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Dude, we were good!
Ooh, your brother. Score!
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
What's up?
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
All right Ross!! I get it!!
Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
I mean my God...
You're hurt!
Oh! What's new in sex?
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
The only man I've ever been with is your father.
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
No Joe, no miracle.
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
So, there was no miracle?!
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
Well, h-how is this like that?
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
She asked-asked you out again?
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
I don't know where the phone is.
What?
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Ross?
I'm hurt.
I don't want you to see me naked!
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
What?
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Yeah, but that was different. Y'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
What?! She made the tea!
Oh!
What?!
Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
You what?
All right!! Fine! Fine.
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
No! Come on!
Arrrghh!!
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Hel-lo, Rachel Green.
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
Sorry, Rach.
What are you, what are you doin'?
What?
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
Ohh we're not sailing.
Just pull on it.
What else?
Here you go.
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Rachel, wait, wait.
Can I just say one thing?
What? What?!
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Oh my.
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Hello.
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Fifteen minutes.
Okay.
Oh, yay...
Great...
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
That's right!
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Ooh, who's it for?
Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
Is he romantic with her?
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Are they in love?
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
Ross will do it.
Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Oh! Pathetic!
Ok, so let's talk money.
Well, what about his family?
He didn't have any.
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
No.
Eww!
You are soo enjoying this.
No I didn't.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
You know the words! You are so into this!
We'll be right back sir.
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Sure!
Sure.
Wh-what do we do?
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
Ohh-ha-ha!
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Hi honey!
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
Honey, I love you too.
What?
Huh.
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
Uh-huh.
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
Yes! Hell yes!
Well, then can we meet him?
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Nope. Schhorry.
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
Oh!
I can't find garbage bags!
What is it?!
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
What's the matter?
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Ross, you're like my best friend.
Ross, it's too hard.
No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
I know.
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Huh.. How about 600?
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.
Sorry.
How about 600 and these earrings?
We're paying for this y'know.
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Both!
Neither.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
And your fly's still open...
Ha, I made you look....
Monica, in or out?
I hate this game!
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
YOU KNOW?!!!
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
Oh my God!
Yeah.
Eh, 'cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
I cannot believe you.
Wow! I did not see that coming.
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
Wow, look at these prices.
What are these, like famous chickens?
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
You guys. You suck too.
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
Did he call? Did Mark call?
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
I guess they're back from their date.
Music. Very nice.
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Hey.
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Umm, she kissed me.
What?! You kissed!
Probably just the first half.
Absolutely not.
Y'know maybe a little bit!
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
OK, then get me your purse.
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
OK, here you go. Good luck.
: Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Oh, let's not tell this story.
Oh, come on!
No-no, I'm staying put.
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
So I understand you're looking for a place.
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
Why, where are you going?
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
Oh-no. No. No.
What a bad idea!
Chandler, why are you doing this?
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Then what? What do you want?
You want me to talk you out of it?
No.
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
Why on earth would I understand this?
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
Do I have my own castle?
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
No.
Say more things like that.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
I'd need an expense account.
Because he's stealing from me!
I think he's stealing from me.
Why?
Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Ughh!
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
Really.
Hi.
How come you didn't come over earlier?
Maybe you should put it off.
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
OK, now I'm nervous.
No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
I know, yeah, sorry.
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
It's not a club.
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
No, we kinda broke up instead.
What?!
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Do you wanna play football?
Let's do it! Ross?
What?
Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
Says who? Your mom?
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Yep! That's hilarious!
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
There are seven?!
That's one?
It's kind of an important one!
And um, what-what is that Ross?
Yeah, sure?
So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
The physical act of love.
What?! Are you crazy?
So, uh, how was your day?
Hey you.
Woah, hey, yo.
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
Really? Mine too.
You want me to see a therapist?
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Well there's not much we can do.
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey?
What?
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Aww, look at the little thing.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
That little naked guy would be me.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Who are those people?
Did-did you take these back?
Monica!
Hmm?
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
Amazingly, that makes sense.
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
You think?
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
No.
Well try to keep it down.
I could have cats.
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
Hello! Ohh, kids love me.
I think the check in is that way.
Ahh.
Hey!
Phoebe!
Oh my God! That is so good!
God, you are so strong.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Hey!
She you in the parking lot.
Oh dear God.
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
No, Rach!
And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
You put these on my desk!
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
I did not!
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
It's uh, right through there.
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Pheebs?
No thanks, I've already seen one.
Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Always.
Three of your five, what?
Melt stuff.
Okay, I've got three of my five.
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Oh please, they're having sex.
Yeah.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Shut up!
So, whaddya think George is like?
Monica, will-will you marry me?
Oh, that's beautiful.
Funny one! That's good!
What? I don't get it.
Oh man, this is hilarious.
I think you should drink the fat.
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
What?
Yaaaay!
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Ok, well, this was very special.
Rach, come see who's out here!
Janice is gonna go away now.
I'll be right back.
We have to get her a present?!
Okay.
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
I can't tell you what I know.
Okay, fine.
You don't know!
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
leave...
leave...
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
Phoebe, come on that's silly.
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
You were gonna drink the fat.
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
Well, yeah.
Let's see what else he'll do!
How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
God I know, you're right.
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
Okay, good luck
Thank you, Okay, Okay.
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
Well, h-how is this like that?
Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...
Alrighty, here come the water works.
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
That is the Coast Guard.
Two! I've been engaged twice!
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
You remember when we got these?
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Oh God!
No.
I guess you weren't there.
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
You work with robots!!
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Op, I like credit cards!
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
Okay, good luck
Thank you, Okay, Okay.
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
God I'm just a horrible person.
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Wh-why?
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
How did it go with Erin?
Hey.
Hey!
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
You give me back my Walkman!
You never come into this office again!
Fine!
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
So what are you guys going to do?
Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
So now what have we agreed?
This is crazy.
I know! Robin is so gay!
No more pranks.
And-and what else?
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
Oh, come on!
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
What song was that, Pheebs?
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
Hi Monica!
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Oh, thank God!
Did you get your money back?
Wow! You made a profit!
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
But we should move quick.
No so we're protecting her.
But we should take it.
Why?
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Really! That-that great huh?
Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Hey!
Oh and I'll call ya too!
Bye Joey. Last night was fun.
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
Or I'll call you!
And call me!
What did, what did he say?
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
Hi!
Do you have a minute?
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
Oh really?!
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
Yeah!
I want to keep one.
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Because I knew you were lying!
Well, well, you said it was practice!
Then why did you move?!
All right, come here!
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Where the hell've you been?
You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
Yo- hooo!
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Are you drunk?!
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
You do? Why?
Because I think it means more to you.
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
No. A break from us.
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
Oh wow! This is so cool.
That's it.
Oh my God!
Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
Oh honey, but it is just about...
What?
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
It is! It is!
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Why, why, why would you dream that?
More importantly, was I any good?
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
We are looking at a Playboy.
It's only you.
Wh-wh-what are you doing?
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
Oh my God.
Well, what-what 'cha got there?
Hey!
Hi!
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
No so we're protecting her.
No that could kill her.
Well, we don't want that.
But we should take it.
But we should move quick.
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
Hm-mm.
Oh so-so not really never.
Really?!
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Oh-ho, and mine!
4 o'clock. Food?
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Uh, here. What time?
Finger sandwiches and tea.
Ooh great! Very Monica.
AND YOU KNOW!!!
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
YOU KNOW!!!!
Yeah, I know!!!!
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Eh. Beth dies.
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Beth, Beth dies?
Um-hmm.
Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
Oh.. Never mind. Who are you?
Red Barbra?
Yeah.
She-she died Jill.
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
What?
Chandler!
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Wow! This place is fabulous!
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
You guys wanna get some coffee?
He doesn't do much, does he?
No, this is pretty much it.
Yeah.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
It'll be a short one.
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Ohhh...
So you know how to fix it?
What, what's it, what's going on?
Yeah, this has happened before.
Yep. Put more gas in.
Hi!
Awww, just like his daddy.
Everything okay in there?
Don't talk to me now!
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
What-what about Monica?
No, I stuff outside the bra.
What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
What is this? Ross, what is this?
No, you don't.
All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
Good luck.
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
What-what are-what are these?
Hey!
Hi!
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
No-no-no, no!
Really?! You think that will work?
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
What the heck is that?
Okay. Let's use this brush.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Ohh.
Okay. This stuff?
Yeah.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
We checked. A lot.
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Thanks!
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
You're out of Diet Coke.
Oh...
I know. Hand me a tissue.
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
What?!
You're out of toilet paper!
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
How?
Hey!
Hey! What's up?
I just, I feel, I-I just...
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...
What?!
What?
I feel...
How'd it go with Pete?!
Hey.
Hey!
Tell us!
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
Monica, where did you get these?!
Sure? Thanks.
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
I made them!
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Yeah, I-I don't care.
Oh come on, I already went.
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Oh, Rachel.
You did not go!
Come on.
You stole them from me!!
No! They are mine!
You stole them from me!
Gimme them!
You just wanna each take one?
It's a pretty cool tux.
Yeah.
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
We should really learn how to play the real way.
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Oh my God! How?!
Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
I know!
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
You let Joey drive it?!
Hey!
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
And I'm going to go get drunk.
Hello.
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Dude, what am I gonna...
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Worked like a charm.
Hi!
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
Well, I-I don't like it.
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Hello.
Hi! It's me.
Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
I pick you, Phoebe.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
Hey.
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
Ooh great! Very Monica.
4 o'clock. Food?
Finger sandwiches and tea.
And chili!
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
I didn't know you could get married here.
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
May I help you?
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
He could hear me.
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
Excuse me. Hi.
Let's dry 'em again.
Are you're hands still wet?
Uh, moist, yeah.
Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Ross, there is no us, OK.
Do the claws again.
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
No, but. . .
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Well, look at that, same thing.
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
What is this? What are we doing?
C'mon.
OK, that's dead right?
Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
Grape.
Throw in the duck too!
Oooohh that's interesting.
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
I meant, me plus one!
No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so...
But you said one.
Okay. Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
All right, I'll see you tonight.
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
How are you holding up?
Not bad.
Thanks.
So were you guys together a long time?
No, I think that was the whole all.
Really?
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
What?!
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Turned out it was a hat.
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Cat!
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Men just take out wind?
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
Wow.
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
Hmmm, that's very cool.
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
I can't believe she cracked your code!
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
You dont even have cats.
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
I could have cats.
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
No thanks. I'm 29.
Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight?
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Hi, hi can I help you?
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
Hi.
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut.
It's kinda slutty.
It's yours!
Me too.
Hi Jill!
Op, I like credit cards!
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Well, so what does he do?
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Great! Roomie!
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
What?! What else did he say?
Right! Okay.
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Ben, dinner!
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
I knew it!
Cool, girl roommate.
Well?
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Rachel, calm down!
Just calm down woman!
Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Such a pig!
Oh he's like a...
He's like a big disgusting...
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
I'm just cleaning up.
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Oh.. a little..
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Can't do it, can you?
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
It's worse than the thumb!
Nooo!
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
Hey, this is so unfair!
Oh, why is it unfair?
Okay, well, we won that one.
Ha-ha!
They have another guess.
Okay, the last thing...
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!
Sure we should... So.
Hey, you.... So, what's up?
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Okay.
I want the little round waffles.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Well, well, you said it was practice!
Okay.
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Then why did you move?!
Because I knew you were lying!
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
What're you guys doing out here?
Hey.
Hey.
Well, not playing raquetball!
He forgot to leave his grip size!
Well relax, he'll be here.
I thought you only met him once?
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
I don't know...right, he's the pig!
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
Such a pig!
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
We're the Bings.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
No, was he any good in it?
Ya think?
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Take it like a man, Ross!
Just once!
Stay away!
No! No!
Oh, come on!
It's not random, it's Bob.
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
Why would I have to sleep with you?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Me.
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Hey.
No, it was just the three of us.
No.
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
Huh!
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
Yes. You're not asking are you?
Oh, Mon, sure.
Really?
No.
Yes! Totally!
No, yeah, Ive done that.
No, no, no!
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Ive never done that.
I've got some bad news.
Hi, Ross.
Yeah, huh.
What?
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God!
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
Joey, you have got to take this back!
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
No! Joey!
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Well then I demand a recount!
What?!
I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Actually, it wasn't that close.
No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
Just calm down woman!
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Me too!
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Yes!!! Oh!!
That's a good story, Grandpa.
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Hey
Hey
You mean, you mean 30 days?
In a month?
Yeah!
Yeah.
From now?
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
That's right.
Oh man! I did it again!
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
No, you could've lost your job.
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
No, don't worry about it.
Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
Thank you! You're great!
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Big time!
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
Would anybody like more coffee?
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
There's an image.
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
I'm just serving it.
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
Eew! It's creepy looking!
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Hey.
Hey.
Oh-ho, yeah!
Sit!
OK, Phoebs. But what about you?
What woman?
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
What?!
To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
What else?
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Why not?
Because! You're mean on the boat!
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
Yeah, but even soo.
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
How is that the silver lining?
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
You have to really wanna see it.
Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars.
Yeah.
Good luck.
Shut the door! Shut the door!!
What's-what's going on?
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
I know!
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Yeah. Right.
Wow! How are you?!
How often do you read it?
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
Oh! My hero! What happened?
Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
What a minute, what did he say?
Why aren't you home yet?!
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Is someone there?
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Hey.
How's the big anniversary dinner?
Ohhh, nice.
No, we kinda broke up instead.
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
Melissa!
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Wh-what do you mean?
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Yeah, okay, my bad.
Hey!
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys.
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
Oh, nobody's judging you.
With ah, extra anchovies.
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
No anchovies.
That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
All right, it won't come off!
Dance karate?
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
What?!
It won't come off!
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
I bet it was about her a little.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Wait, are you leaving?
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Okay.
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
I don't get this! She was horrible!
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
Why do you care so much anyway?
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Eh, no problem.
Totally.
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
I don't have ten minutes!!
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Oh God, I really had a good time!
That's not European!
Well, it felt French.
Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Because, uh-it has to.
No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
Why?
You have all the answers, don't you?
Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
Excuse me, there was no time!
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
What?!!
Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
You kissed him?!
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Thanks Chandler.
Happy New Year, Joey!
Happy New Year, Pheebs!
You too!
So did that do anything for ya?
Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Ross, Joey is not here.
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
Yeah!
And um...You look nice today.
What?
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Op, ice. I need ice.
Ahh. Thank you!
Diet Coke.
Okay.
Thank you.
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
I remember you did.
God!! What am I gonna do?!
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Because you do.
I am so hot for you right now.
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Phoebe Buffay?!
Hey, how'd the interview go?
You got a problem with that?
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
So don't do it.
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
No, you know what, I think you should go.
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
I get it! Well, that's that.
What?
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
Phoebe are you serious?
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
No!
Phoebe...
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
A scooter!
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Okay.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
Just for a second.
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Oh, that's great.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
Oh, thank you so much! Okay.
Oh I know.
Better than Chandler.
Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
Okay, but.
Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go...
Oh my God!
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
You all know? Does Ross know?
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean." Or, y'know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
What?!
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Whaddyou want?
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Does anybody want anything else?
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
What?
OK honey, you're dating Ross.
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
Steve... sleeve!
She didn't hang up either!
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
She didn't hang up either...
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
No, it's a concept!
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
Well, that's because of a lot of...
Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Why not?!
Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
I know!
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Sophie's desk.
Noo!
Chandler!!
We love you, we're here for you.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
Yeah good luck, good luck.
Thanks.
Wh-You dated my sister!
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
That was different!
What? Why?!
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Why?!
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
I'll figure something out.
Joey, did you my face cream?
No.
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
She didn't hang up either!
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Okay!
Could tonight be the Night?
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
What?
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
So, did you shave your legs?
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Hi!
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
Maybe I should go!
Sit down! We're winning!
No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
Jurassic Park could happen.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
I do not always have to be-okay, okay.
Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
Pretty nice?
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
Okay.
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
Yeah, right. Sure!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
That is not true!
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
If you want.
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
You completely stole my answer!
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
You want me to talk you out of it?
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
No.
No.
Then what? What do you want?
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
What?
Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I... I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have...
Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Okay!
Now?
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Sure.
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Which one do you think she is?
What d'you think?
Lotsa things.
May I help you?
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Well, what is the other reason?
I don't want to say.
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Oh crap!
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Yeah!
Okay! Check it out!
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Okay!
Not in the street!!
Oh wow! Look at this place!
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Merry Christmas!
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
Oh my God!
Yeah well unless we tell him.
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
Oh no!
Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Totally.
Phoebe are you serious?
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Okay. I'll be right back.
What are you doing here?!
I came with Paul!
Would you excuse me for a second?
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
All right. I'm a total pro!
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
Thank you! Good meeting you.
Hello?
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Well, I-I could live without it.
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
Noo.
What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
What?!
I just, I feel, I-I just...
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Hey Joey, can I...
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
Is he here?
No.
Hey!
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
Time is money my friend?
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
I'm 30!
Aww crap!
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
I found it!
On your dresser.
Okay that is the one we already have!
I've never lived like this before.
Really?
Yeah! Look!
I know.
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Oh?
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
Then what's with all the bananas?
Gimme back my monkey.
I don't have a monkey.
Potassium.
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Why isn't it working out?
Is he not cute enough for you?
No!
Uhh, we still need a tip.
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
I love you too.
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
A couple of bucks.
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
That's too bad.
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Well why didn't you take the job?
Merrill Lynch?
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
It was only 500 bucks.
Almost.
How much was it?
500 bucks at a flea market?!
Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
You went shopping for fur?
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
You bought boobs?
Pretty uhm, different huh?
I know.
I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?
You're just staring into space.
Pheebs, I have to ask you...
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.
This one?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Oh really?!
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Why's that?
We took our apartment back!!
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
What the hell is going on?!
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
We are switching back, right now!
Okay! All right! How was she?
Just get out! Now!!
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Uh-oh.
What?
Oh, I read that in high school.
Okay.
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Hi.
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Really.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
High-five, the babies are coming!
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
And your fly's still open...
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
Ha, I made you look....
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Hey!
Not even with your best friend.
Were both of those Joey?
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Noo!
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
Barry who I almost.
And Mindy, your maid of...?
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
I was tired!
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Isn't that mine?
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
You are ready to make a commitment!
You made it!
You're there!
Whoa! Don't know about that.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
All right, so we weren't prepared!
Ohh, you're a freak!!
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
And all these people actually died?
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
Well look, if you don't like this...
You don't even know!
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
You really think it would be that different?
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
Well, things change.
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
All right, Julie.
Bye.
That's not bad.
Hey.
Does anybody need more coffee?
Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
Yeah, I'll take some.
Hey, there's a dog out there!
Now that she broke up with you?
So were you guys together a long time?
A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Yeah.
Yeah. Hmmmm.
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Hey, hey, hey no.
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
And Monica, what are you going to make?
What are you going to make?
Yummy noises.
I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
You just did a little dancy thing.
What was that?
What?
No I didn't.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Where are they?
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
You are really frightening me.
So did you break up with Joanna?
No he doesn't!
Two hours, that lasted!
I think so.
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
I'm sorry?
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
Not following you.
Think about it.
Well, thank you, Melanie.
OK, this one right here is from me.
Okay! All right, pick a half.
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
What do we use to split it?
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Hey!
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
Well, in a nutshell. . .
So, um, have you told your parents?
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
You are?
Yeah, what's the gala for?
It's a uh, regatta gala.
Were both of those Joey?
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Not even with your best friend.
I could not have done this without you.
Yes! Did you see that?
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you sure?
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
Hey Pete.
So umm, what's this book about?
Hi!
Hi!
You didn't read this one either?!
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Down at the docks again?
That, that's what's stupid.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Who's this from?
Oh, that's Ross's.
Remembered what?
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Okay.
Or not.
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
Okay, then.
Okay.
Yeah, me too.
So, see ya on Saturday.
How have you never been on Oprah?
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
He got it a flea market!
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Sure!
You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
Hey!
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
Ben just said hi.
What, the word hi?
Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
Any sign of your brother?
Hey Pheebs.
Hey!
No, but he's always late.
I thought you only met him once?
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
So, would you like any dessert?
No! No dessert, just a check, please.
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
...how about I move in with you?
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Oh!
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
Who's Denise?
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
I-We gotta get Monica.
Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Go! Go! Go!
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
Oh, no no, I am.
Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
No! God, would you just calm down!
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
Sophie sit!!
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
He forgot to leave his grip size!
He didn't get the goggles!
Goodbye, baby.
Ciao, bela.
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
Then uh, what's-what's this?
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Okay.
Break!
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
That's right!
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
Yeah-eah-ha!
Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Okay.
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
What?
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
Because I promised Mindy I would.
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
Oh my God! My dog died!
And condoms are the way to do that?
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
What?!
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Hey, you.... So, what's up?
Mindy.
Hey, you.
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Sure we should... So.
: We have apple cinnamon...
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
Wow!
All right, straight, and not subtle.
Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Fine.
Are you still awake?
Yeah! You?
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
Have at it.
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Okay.
Hey, do you guys have... ...hi.
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
Hi.
Where you goin'?
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
What's going on?
Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
So, did you shave your legs?
Could tonight be the Night?
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Yeah.
A-ha!
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
Not after this!
I gotta go.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Could I play?
I just did them.
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Yeah, I don't need it.
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
Hi!
Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.
Oh, okay.
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Oh, it's gonna be fine.
You all know? Does Ross know?
We?!
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
God. You seem really, really nice.
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
Okay, bye-bye.
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
It's for me.
Oh. Okay, bye.
I get to hire my own assistant!
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
Oooh!
Ahhh!!
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
Right, I'll see you guys later...
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
..Naughty!
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Huh. Does Monica know about this?
Well, what are you going to wear?
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
I don't think so.
Can I please be there when you tell her?
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Okay, okay, you got it!
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
No! I'm so happy for them!
Me too! So happy for them!
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
It depends on who asked.
Oh!
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
What if I asked?
Oh, Mon, sure.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
No, not a problem.
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Hey Rach?
Yeah?
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
You seen Sandy?
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
What?
The bll is drrbing!
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Ball? There is no ball.
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Joey, please!
Sorry.
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Dude, you are sick.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
All right, I'm outta here!
Well what is it? Let me see.
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
Hey, someone order a coat?
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
I'm so sorry.
That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
What do you mean?
You seem to really like her.
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
I'd do anything for you.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
And a crappy New Year.
That's so sweet.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Here, here!
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
Okay, go to the left. The left!
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
I don't know why you just don't say left.
Huh?
Just sit over there!!
So it would just be, me alone?
What-what about Monica?
Oh, she isn't home.
Well, Ben would be there.
Huh umm...
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
Oh God help me.
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
Why don't you ask him out?
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.
He just got a divorce right?
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Actually they were Nana's.
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
That little naked guy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing.
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Kinda.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
Why?!
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
Ok, that's so nice.
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
There's more alcohol, right?
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
Oh.
Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Good luck Chandler.
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Would you just open it?
We all chipped in.
We did?
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Thanks for being born.
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Wow, he must like you the best.
Really?
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
About what?
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
At his apartment. Is this juice?
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
All right. Okay. I'm starving!
Yeah!
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
Great set tonight Phoebs.
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
Phoebe's got another job, right?
I know.
Well, we should probably get going.
Come on, they were not that huge.
I broke up with her.
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
But he has to know how I feel!
Ehh, pardon me?
You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I'm afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
Well I-I think your wrong.
He doesn't speak much English.
Hi!

Monopoly!
Look at that!
No-no, they're not very nice people.
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Are you close with them?
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
I said I'll do it!
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
Off to see young Ethan?
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Thank you.
How young is young Ethan? Young?
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
I don't know Rachel, why?
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
No.
Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
You do now. You're having dinner with me.
Shut up.
Foot rubs for a month!
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Freedom!
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Time's up, now your dead.
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
And deaf!
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Get out, get out of my apartment.
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Least of all you.
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Oh.
Hey! Rachel!
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
I don't know, I don't know.
All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Ohh that'd be great!
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
No, we kinda broke up instead.
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Ohhh, nice.
What?!
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
Why?!
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
Psss, that is whack!
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
Open up. We want to talk to you.
I don't feel like talkin.
We're worried about you.
And some of us really have to pee.
I don't even know how I would go about it.
No. Have you?
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Oh, please!
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Oh my God you stole her award!
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
I want the little round waffles.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Arghhhh!!!!!!
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
I know, I can do more than cook.
Hi you!
Oh my God!
I like her. She sees smart.
Uhh, Rachel, my parents...
Yeah do it now, call right now.
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
This is my favorite part.
Yeah me too.
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Was your basket on top?
So?
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
And that makes you angry because...
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Our apartment is ready.
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Where did you get that?
So how's it goin' with Joey?
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
Okay.
Uh, okay.
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
You think so too?
No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
You didn't break up with that fireman?
I know. I need more pie.
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Wow!
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Great!
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
Very good Monica! You know where they are.
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
Uh-huh.
I'm not going to do that.
Yes, exactly!
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
How long do cats live?
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
I'm sorry?
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Oh, right!
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Well, look at that, same thing.
Let us keep the apartment and...
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Totally worth it!
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
I do Raquel.
So, uh, he's back.
No, not a problem.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Oh!
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Okayyy!
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Of course!
Oh that's so great!
That's all!
Ohhhh!! ...What? What?
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
Monica, where did you get these?!
I made them!
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Good day for married people huh?
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Nope. We took her to lunch.
What?
Did you call the cops?
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Noo. Why?
Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.
It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
Shake it off.
I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times.
Surely you can think of something good.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Did you two...
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
And you know Monica and Ross!
Hi Jill.
Hey, how you doin'?
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
I'll be right there!
They're here already? How are they doing this?
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Monica said wedding.
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
It'll be a short one.
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
In a bad way?
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
You made it!
And stop saying that! I hate that!
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Okay.
Okay!
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Ohh, good.
And I do have one seat left.
The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.
Huh.. How about 600?
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Pretty much.
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Macadamia nut?
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
Okay, let's go running!
Let's run towards them!
OK!
I thought you only met him once?
Any sign of your brother?
No, but he's always late.
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
Well relax, he'll be here.
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
Ohhhh, come on!!!
I think she's here.
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
I mean it's the end of an era!
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
I'm gonna miss you!
I know!
Okay, bye!
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
That's what I did. Wah-pah!
You can't do anything!
Hey!
Oh! It's you. Hi.
How come you didn't come over earlier?
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
Hi.
'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
Just a waitress?
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
What are these?
Electrical plans for the building.
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Wow! If only more people knew.
I can not believe your trading me!!
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Are you gonna let me play?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
What's going on?
Oh no! No! No! No!
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Come on, take 'em off!!
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
I'm just making margaritas.
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Okay, then what happened?
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
We did have fun, didn't we?
We did!
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
First of all, I'm not losing...
Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
Hel-lo, Rachel Green.
How can you not remember us kissing?!
You'll vamp?!
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Hey!
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
I can't go to lunch!!
Right.
What's going on?
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
Phoebe that's crazy!
I can't believe she would say that too you.
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Wow, it was so-wow!
Really?! I mean, really?!!
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
I'll help you throw out your purse.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Happy birthday sweetie.
Really?
No, I knew.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
You are!
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
No.
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
Okay.
So, I'll umm...
No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Um-hmm, yeah.
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Yes! Rent!
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
So, what should you have done?
Uh-Huh, Which is...?
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
No.
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
I cannot believe her.
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Whe-where did he put it?!
Oh my God.
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
What?!
Okay, a thousand.
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
There he is! There he is!
Where?
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
Sagittarius?
Yep.
Well I tell you what...
Yeah?
Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
Hey.
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
I won the game.
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
And was the curse lifted?
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Uh-hmm.
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
That's a line from the show too!
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
You are asking me to be your wife!
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Pretty good.
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Look, either help me or go.
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Rachel...
Fine. I'll go.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
Hey!
Hey!
Sure.
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
How many guesses do you get?
Five.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Six.
Challenge extended.
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. .
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
Did I get it?
Yeah.
Who are you saying "check" too?
Don't read my condoms!
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Okay that is the one we already have!
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
On your dresser.
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
What?
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
Hey-hey, Ross?
What? Shut up! We're winning!
Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
That's not even a game!
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
Fine, let's do it.
I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
Hey Joe!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
You?! And-and you?!
It's not funny, this is actually my job.
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
I haven't seen him in so long!
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
That almost hit me in the face.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Here you go.
All right, we have to pick captains.
And then Tineals.
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Hey, guys, what's up.
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
You went shopping for fur?
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
You were right.
Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.
No.
You!
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Fine.
Good.
Good.
How about 600 and these earrings?
Huh.. How about 600?
Sorry.
They prefer it if I don't barter.
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
I cannot believe you.
What?
You should get some sleep.
Okay.
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Hey!
Hi! Hey!
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
I mean he just started going out with her.
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
You never come into this office again!
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
Never!
Fine!
You give me back my Walkman!
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
Oh my God, what happened?
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
Ross's what?
I'd need an expense account.
Say more things like that.
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
Done!
And an assistant.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Okay, I freaked out a little.
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
You guys ready fore the movies?
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
Yeah!
That's true.
It was just a kiss.
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
Done.
Really?
Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
What?
See? Now, he could date her.
Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
That's not what she said last night.
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
You have a play date with a stripper?!
There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
Yeah.
Man, I gotta get a kid.
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
That's so exciting.
Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
Here.
Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
Storming out!
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Damn Rollos!
Hey, you're back!
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
You are?
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
You can't, because of the new skylight!
See?
Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
That's weird, she locked the door.
Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
...if you tell me, I might do it.
Ross, you know what...
What?
Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Yeah.
People are trying to sleep in here!
God, what happened?!
Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Open it up, let me see.
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Yeah.
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Noo! Angels.
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
And I also brought my friend Joey...
Oh!! Shrimp toast!
Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
Okay, that is all you.
So-so, what do you want for lunch?
Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
So, um, will you bring the truck?
Not her.
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
I'll even let you ring the bell.
Oh, my god.
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
What?!
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
You have a line down your face.
What?
Oh my God!
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Good, good, good, good, good.
Oh, I would love to!
Yay, okay!
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Um... Done!
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
No?
No. Rosita does not move.
As in Rosita does not move.
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
That's a line from the show too!
All right, then you owe me $350.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
Joey...
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Ohhhhh!
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
All right.
Here he comes! Hurry!
Hey! Don't be a baby!
Well I...
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
Okay.
I'm really gonna miss you.
Thanks.
Yeah.
What, what's it, what's going on?
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Okay. Oh, no!
Yeah, this has happened before.
So you know how to fix it?
Ah, so what are we looking at?
Oh, God.
Sorry.
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
Really?
Well, at least that's a great suit.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
Okay.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
So you didn't leave the bank?
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
To pay for the gym.
Hey.
This is how I would hold a football.
Ok.
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
Ok, here, here. There we go.
Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
All right, we should call somebody.
Well it stupid, unfair question!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
Don't blame the questions!
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Get your hands out of there! No!
No..!
Show them to me!
Let me see! Show them!
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
Well that wasn't easy.
Ok, dinner's on.
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
What?!
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
Well, you would know.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Yeah, I'm an actor.
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Here. I thought you might be cold.
Hey.
Oh, hi.
Thank you.
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Thank you.
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
You're not an artist.
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Take the top down did ya?
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Only way to fly.
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Oh Fonzie.
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
Well now it's an empty bar.
What are you doing?
Open bar!
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
Yeah?
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Come, come here.
We can't do this.
Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.
I hope he did!
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.
I'll get it.
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Why did you do that?
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
you don't have insurance?
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
What? What's what you were afraid of?
Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
What?
Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
I'm sorry things didn't work out...
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
Okay.
Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-
Sure. You got it. Great!
Oh, good.
Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
So...
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
That is neither here nor there.
That's....
That's what?!
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Somebody got in late last night.
Morning.
Hey.
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
When did this happen?
Well those are very popular frames.
Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
Neil Sedaka wears them.
I hear you can get people out of here.
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
That is so sweet, you guys.
Hey, Mon.
Mon!
What?
Call her! Call her now!
No. I...
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Just give us our apartment back!
Ohh, well you got 'em.
All right!
Boy! I didn't see that coming!
Are you serious?
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Hello.
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
Oh, I'm sure.
Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
All right, Julie.
Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
Okay!
Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
Yeah?
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Here you go. Thank you!
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
You did.
What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.
Oh my God.
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Okay uh, however...
My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
But....
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
You're kidding! Where? Where?
Oh, Rachel!
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Well that sounds fun too.
Have you ever been with a woman?
So there is no good time to ask that question.
The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
You will?!
Well, yeah.
You were gonna drink the fat.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
Yeah?
Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat.
No! You can't do that!
Grammy, Best New Artist.
Yeah.
What award are you practicing for?
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
Ohh that's great!
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Are you sure?
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Joey, did you my face cream?
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Where do you think, Zelda?
You found my book?!
And I also brought my friend Joey...
Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department.
Oh, hi.
Oh!! Shrimp toast!
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
Okay, that we may be able to do.
What?!
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
How?
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
It's-it's hot...
Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! Huh?!
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Yeah...
I am. Let me just get my coat.
What?
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
No don't! Go back to repeating!
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
Damnit!
Damnit!
Oh crap!
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Joey! Come here! Come here!
What? What?
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Hello? Who are we spying on?
I see pizza!
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
We are so gonna find them this year.
Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
Yeah.
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
The shipment never made it through Omaha?
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Not bad.
Who's that?
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
He's perfect, he's never been better.
Hi!
How's my little boy?
What'd you do, take him whaling?
Monica.
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Well, close to...
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Ohh! Really?!
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about.
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
To get you to make out with him!!!
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Ohhh.
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
I'm sorry. See ya.
Isn't it.
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
Your fly is open, Geller.
Yes! .... or no.
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Are you seein her again tonight?
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
Yep. Ice Capades.
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Thanks!
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Thanks Chandler.
Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
Yes!
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
It must take you forever to find your keys.
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Just pickle.
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
So, will I like any of these guys?
Sure! Where are the seats?
Wherever! I've got like 20!
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Chandler!
Okay, calm down, here they are.
The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Phoebe!
What are we going to do?!
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Hi.
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Well, I think I can help you get over him.
You can?
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Noo.
You still love me.
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Rach, here's your mail.
No, here's your mail.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Uh, we are here to break up with you.
Hello, sweetheart.
Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
Both of you?
Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Ohh that's nice.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Well kinda old, like 30.
Oh.
That really is something; that's really cool.
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Yeah!
Howdy partner!
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
Go ahead.
Who did we fight in World War I?
Mexico?
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
No, was he any good in it?
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
Oh, yeah.
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
Wow! If only more people knew.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Turned out it was a hat.
Cat!
Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
Marcel?
You are so just doing this out of spite.
Small...
Small...
Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
Huh?
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Very good.
Rachel! What are you doing here?
Your good friend?
Yeah!
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
So?
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Don't blame the questions!
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
But it is our apartment!
No it's not!
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Who?
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
Hello?
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Damnit!
What? Why? Where are you?
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
Oh!
I am so jealous.
Yes. Right where?
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Hey!
Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Ohh, fun!
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
I can't take any...
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Hey!
What a tool!
Yeah!
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
Hey, how you doin'?
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
Daddy cut me off.
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Why does it matter so much to you?!
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
Yeah but Phoebe...
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
Okay.
Well?
Mmmm! It's good!
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Yeah.
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
Oh my God!
Oh, no!
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
So?
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Okay!
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Excuse me.
Morning!
Pretty good.
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Nothing!
Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Hang in there. You hang in there.
That would be great!
Yeah, all right, it's a date.
Did you say something?
No, just singing.
What am I making him by the way?
Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Um-hmm.
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Ross.
Sure! God, please take those off!
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Great! Thanks, Rach!
All right.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya.
OK.
How far'd ya get?
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
That.
Luck!
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
I'm never gonna find love again.
Sure
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
Do you even know who Kip is?
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Hey, you're not Kip!
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Some uh, some visual aides.
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Thank you!
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Please don't say naked chicks.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
Oh, god.
Ohhh.
I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Let me get my coat.
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Okay! All clear!
Thanks Phoebe!
Everything okay in there?
Don't talk to me now!
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
I guess we just keep dancing.
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Hi!
Well you said you couldn't go out so....
You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
Hey!
Yeah.
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Oh damnit!
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
Okay.
Really.
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
The meeting with the guy went great?
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Ooh! Brian's Song!
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Good luck! Go get 'em!
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
But I made cards!!
G'night.
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
How-how did you lose your job here?
Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...
Wow! That is a bad audition.
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Y'know?
You practice losing the Grammies too?
Ah.
Oh hey!
So did you read your evaluation yet?
Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
Mm! Night Gar'!
No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Amen!
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
Who?
Fourth gear!!
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Oh God!
Oh hey!
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Oh.
DANGER!!!!!
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
Hi.
Hi.
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Ooh, God it looks bad.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
He's really picky about his patients.
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
We'll take Literature!!
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
No!!
I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
How have you never been on Oprah?
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
Um, I'm not.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
Really?
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
No more jam?!
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Who are you supposed to be?
The vicar!
Like a goalie, right?
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
So, whaddya think George is like?
Oh please, they're having sex.
Shut up!
I think he's shy.
Yeah?
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
What?!
All right, I'm gonna go!
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Halftime.
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
Great, you can cover Chandler.
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Well, what about Mindy?
Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
They had to have that specially made?!
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Oh.
Not yet.
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Why on earth would I understand this?
Then what? What do you want?
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
Oh.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
Oh, that's great.
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
See? I've even called Animal Control!
You called Animal Control?
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
I know. My arm is killing me.
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
What's going on?
So were you guys together a long time?
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
Thanks.
A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Now that she broke up with you?
I don't have any issues with my Father.
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
Whoa, she's pretty.
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
You look fabulous honey, you really do.
Yeah? Are you sure, really.
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
You are a frightening, frightening man.
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
Shut up!
I'm sorry!
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Isn't there a national football league.
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
Phoebe?
Well, he stabbed me first!!
Okay.
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
You promised you would break up with her!
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
No way. No way did you do this.
...Take off their hats!
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
Monana was very brave.
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Um, what- what would make you think that?
Oh sure it is!
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Wow! What an unusual cat!
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
Hey.
How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
Okay.
Umm...
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
All right.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
In the death seat?!!
Oh my...
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
That'd be good...
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Yes, it was!
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Oh God, I really had a good time!
Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
Yeah!
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Hi!
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
How did that happen?
That yeti is one smooth talker.
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
I'm just helping the kids!
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Mr. Tribbiani.
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
And what will that be on the side of?
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
No.
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Well that sounds fun too.
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
Oh-ho!
Sorry.
Sorry, I'm sorry. Close, close, close...
Okay, just sweep it.
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
What?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Yeah, me too.
Fine.
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Oh, hello Rachel.
How did you get in here?
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
Yeah, totally.
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
That's great. Good for you guys.
I am not high maintenance!
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Works on you.
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Who? Is that your sister?
Ugh, she is a slut!
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Pheebs, I was wondering...
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
Sorry-
No no no, go-
Split it?
Okay.
Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
Oh, hi!
Hey.
Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
So. How'd you guys meet?
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Yep, I'm in a tree.
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
Yes?
You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?
Oh.. Never mind. Who are you?
Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
What?
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
Is it dry in here?
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Ross, I...
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
Oh damnit!
Oh damnit!
Damnit!
No don't! Go back to repeating!
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
I know.
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
How do you figure?
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
Well, where's the logic in that?!
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
Rachel, that's all we do.
What about Julie?
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
Absolutely, yeah!
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Why?
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
Will you get us better gifts?
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Okay, you're on.
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Oh God!
You remember when we got these?
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
Okay.
I'll get back to my new job.
Man, she is really gullible.
Here you go.
Guess who we ran into today?!
Hello!
Hey! Ah!!
Janice?!
Isn't this amazing?
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Oh, just ask him!
Me?!
At his apartment. Is this juice?
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Where?
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
Hello? Who are we spying on?
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Please tell me it's his mother.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Cappuccino.
Grazie.
Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
Yeah?
And you're no friend to those with noses.
It may not be a bed of roses.
Rachel.
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
Oh Drake.
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
Thank you.
Okay.
You just thought of that in there?
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
What the hell is that?
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Something to remember me by!
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Go!
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
There it is.
Hey.
Do I look fat?
What? You just click when they click.
I'm totally getting it!
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Here, look, alright, does this help?
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.
Why does it matter so much to you?!
Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
But why does it even matter?!
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
So you guys want me to take this back?
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Big Bird's friend.
I see pizza!
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Anybody gonna eat that?
Why, when did you get out of the game?
For what?
I've gotta get back in the game.
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
Oh no.
That yeti is one smooth talker.
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
How did that happen?
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
Oh, ah with who?
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
Oh! That's fine.
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
Ohhh!
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Ross, sweetheart!
Aw what are you?! A detective?
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Oh.
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
Why not?!
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Hey!
Hey!
Can I please be there when you tell her?
Huh. Does Monica know about this?
I don't think so.
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Hey!
Let's get the show on it!
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
Closer than here?
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Okay. Sorry.
Ugh! What grandmother?
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Beautiful!
Your grandmother would have hated this.
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Nah, I got it.
Hi!
Hey!
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
We're paying for this y'know.
Neither.
Lusts of the flesh.
What?
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
Oh.
No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
Well, uh.
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized...
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
This, this actually is a...
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
No! No-no-no...
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?
Not really.
Okay.
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
It's Robert Bobby.
Oh.
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
What do you need help for?
I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
Oh my God. What happened?
Well that's great! Congratulations!!
Yeah. A year ago..
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
What's the part, Anti-man?
U-N-I-sexy?
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
What? It's, it's just a phase.
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
Ohhh!!!!
Yes, yes, that's right...
What? Ow!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Up!
You changed?
And lucky means, more cleavage?
Does for me.
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
I don't know.
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
What?!
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Oh really? Like what Monica?
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
All right.
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Oh, it's gonna be fine.
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Kinda. Oh my God!
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Ross, you're like my best friend.
I know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
Okay. Umm...
Okay, what's going on with you?
Nothing! You go!
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Not yet.
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
Pretty soon I guess.
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Does it hurt?
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
About what?
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
Would you give me one minute!! Please.
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
Oh! You know what I need?
Yeah!
Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
Yay!!
Hey.
Hey. Oh, I'm sorry, this is Cailin.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Why are you laughing?
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Thank you!
Hey.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Hm-mmm.
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Joey, this is you!
Let me see. Oh, right.
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
And that's how you bought it?
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Yeah, which was nice.
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
Yeah, where the hell is he?
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
What for?
Hey, Monica!
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Yeah.
Have you ever seen so much crap?
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Check this out. Can I have this?
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Hey, uh, Joey?
Umm?
Oh, no!
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
What's Flimby's?
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
Ye-e-es!!
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
I like her. She sees smart.
Uhh, Rachel, my parents...
Hi.
Hello.
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
Stripping!
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Ugh!
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
You really think so?
Whoa, she's pretty.
Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
That's right! You do what the hand says!
No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand.
I'll take care of it.
How did it go?
I lost our mattresses.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
this summer?
Work on your music?
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Actually, that's our three hole punch.
Hey.
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
Okay.
Oh!!
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Phoebe.
Sweetie, now I pick you.
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
But...
Oh! Oh, I love that but.
Yeah.
Okay. Every time.
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Beef.
I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
Really?
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
What's the matter?
No, it was. It was very very good.
Well, what about Mindy?
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
Hummus. I got the hummus.
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars.
You're doing it again.
Excuse me.
We won't. 300?
Monica?!
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
And now I've picked it up again.
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
Thank you.
Let me, let me get you some wine!
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Is it dry in here?
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Yeah.
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
OK, then get me your purse.
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
You need to get some sleep.
I need to get some Richard.
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Maybe, because you told him not to.
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Any luck?
Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
You put these on my desk!
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Oh my God you stole her award!
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
Joey, you have got to take this back!
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
Oh, that is amazing!
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
Just for a second.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
And then... your face is bloated?
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Me.
Why would I have to sleep with you?
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
I'm unpacking!
What?!
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
What happened?
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
We should help him!
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
It's not funny, this is actually my job.
I tried! They won't take her back.
Baking it didn't help, huh?
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
What?
They published my paper.
Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
Hey!
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Not unless different means the same.
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
You have been maid of honor before?!!
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Hi honey, how did it go?
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Nooo...
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
Well there's not much we can do.
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Ohh! Really?!
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Ah, yeah!
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Yeah!
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
The Luisa from home room!
Yes!!
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
What?
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Uh-oh.
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Oh that.
Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
Hi!
Hi!
Yeah.
Give it here. Oh, God.
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
Did-did you take these back?
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
I loved them!
Yeah. Nice try!
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
It's this way? Sorry.
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
He's coming over! He's coming over!
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
Joey!
I know, here-here!!
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
There's more beer, right?
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
Here. I thought you might be cold.
Thank you.
Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
Do you?
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Really?!
No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
And we didn't have sex.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Mmmm, no.
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
Monica! Stop it!
Damn! It's empty!
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
This is it! This is my category.
Yeah, I got my speech!
Do you got your gracious loser face?
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
What am I making him by the way?
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
Hello?
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
Hey!
So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
Sorry. Sorry.
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Okay, great.
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
I'm sorry?
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Who's this from?
Oh, that's Ross's.
Remembered what?
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.
And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Excuse me?
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
Maybe you could be my roommate!
Well there's an idea!!
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
You give me back my Walkman!
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
Does it hurt?
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is...
That is what the thing is.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
No you guys...
I-I-am-
Hey!
Hey-hey.
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
Really? Well, in that case...
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
Ohh! That's great!
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
Yeah! As long as we're here!
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
I know. My arm is killing me.
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Hey! What's going on?
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
You have been maid of honor before?!!
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Why are you taking this away from me?
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Estelle said I didn't get it.
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
What kind of problem?
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey. Morning, dear.
What's the matter with you?!
I thought it was Chandler!
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Oh.
I'm done.
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Y'know that wasn't part of it?
I know!
For what?
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
These are her earrings.
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Who was that?
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Ten dollars an hour.
No.
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Actually, it's kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
Okay, then.
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
I know, I know. Hello.
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
I thought it went very well.
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
How could you have told her?
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
No.
I'm gonna miss you!
I mean it's the end of an era!
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
I know! What?!
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
Really!
Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
Really! That-that great huh?
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Oh.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Me neither.
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Joey?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
Oh, and how is Allison?
32.
Yeah, look how that worked out.
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
Ugh!
Well, just buy the damn boat!
I'm just helping the kids!
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
What-what is it, what is it?
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight?
Oh come on, not again.
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
You have to pick your moments.
Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
Thanks you guys.
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
He is the man in the black dress.
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
Rub it.
No.
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.
You got a Cheeto on your face man.
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Ross, thats my jacket.
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
I can't believe that didn't work!
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
Hey!
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
His dancing partner?!
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Oh, Ross...
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
Man alive!
Hey, what's going on?
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
Oh, Joey! Sorry!
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
Really?
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Wh-wh-why?!
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Got a job on a river boat?
Oh God!
Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
Mon, look who I ran into!
Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Uh, boat rope.
Uhh, rub it?
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
Hi, thanks for coming.
Somebody called about a monkey?
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Turned out it was a hat.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
Oh, that's me.
No! That's-that's my arm!
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
Freaky.
Weird, weird.
Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
Why?
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-
Also large?
Okay.
Rachel! Could I have a moment?
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Yep!
Go!!
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Oh!
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
OH MY GOD!!!
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Ah!
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Yes.
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Here you go.
Sorry.
Hi!
What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
What? Oh my God!
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
Ow!
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
Taxi.
Bye you.
Is this what you had in mind?
I'll say.
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
I'm gonna do it too!
Me too!
I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
Oh Pheebs.
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
Oh my God, honey that's great.
I know. I just can't find...
You need one too?
Ooooh yeah.
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
What?
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Hey!
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
So, what? That's it?
Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
Oh no, you're the best.
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
Well why shouldn't I?!
Because it's my apartment!
Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Hi!
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
Oooooh!
Deal!
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
What?! Why?!
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Okay. Sure.
No!
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Is that Mark?
Yeah! Got it!
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
And ya know what, now I've got closure.
Good.
Good.
Try the bottom one.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Peter Parker.
Thank you.
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
What a geek!
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Rach, these are for you.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
OK, Phoebs, your turn.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
What's a 'niffle'?
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
What?! Give-give me a brush.
Gimme the keys!
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
What's goin' on?
What stupid thing did you do?
Bon giorno tutti!
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Sure, okay.
What?
I don't want you to see me naked!
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Who, Josh?
It's Joshua.
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
No!
Come on.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
Really!?
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
All right, well how much time do you need?
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
One hour.
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
Maybe he's. . . gay.
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
Thanks!
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?
Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
Bye dad.
Not really.
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
Thank you.
Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Foot rubs for a month!
Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
Space cowboy!
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
And processing.
He carries a briefcase.
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Okay.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
So-Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
Hey!
Hey!
I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
No, wait. Wait.
Oh yeah right!
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
All right, straight, and not subtle.
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Wow!
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Hey, you guys!
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
All right, well how much time do you need?
Do you got your gracious loser face?
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Yeah, I got my speech!
Yeah.
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
What?
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
This woman's living my life.
What?
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
Y'know Marcel?
...Yeah?
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Uh-huh!
And he's, he's a total stranger?
Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
What!?
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
You're not laughing.
This time it's not so funny.
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Oh, thank God.
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
Phoebe, Ross sucks!
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
No, no, I don't.
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Yeah, I don't think so Joe.
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Nothing, why?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
So what's going on with you?
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
We use it!!
There you go!!
I'm not gonna go out with him.
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
No! You should've read it yourself!
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
Well you can split it with another credit card.
I'm just going to need to see your passport.
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.
Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Glass of fat?
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Why not?! I'm hungry.
Because they'll know we've been listening.
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Turn! Turn!
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
Okay. Sorry.
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Why, why not?
Because it's too delicious.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Oh, I'm sorry what?
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
Thank you. We both forgive you.
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Ohh.
...I mean it's my fault.
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
You have been maid of honor before?!!
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
Na-uh, I am!
How come you are?!
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Burning's good.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
I'm gonna call her.
Yeah.
Hi.
We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
Good.
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Thanks. I think you got it!
Well, like father, like son.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Do either of you have the keys?
The oven is on.
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
Ahhhhh!
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Phoebe!
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
We were on a break!
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
Right.
Okay?
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Boy! I didn't see that coming!
Are you serious?
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over...
You're look for laughable...
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
No Rachel! They got here first!
Why is Ross doing that?
You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
Okay.
I don't know what to say.
I think she would like that.
Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
There were times when it wasn't even me.
You know what?
What?
That is so sweet, you guys.
Hey, Mon.
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Give it. Give it.
Okay.
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Okay, I'm totally cool!
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
Come here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Oh my God, has she slept at all?
Nope.
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
What are you guys gonna do?
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Here?! Now?!
Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Whoa-ho.
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
As in Rosita does not move.
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
Stevie the TV?
Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Aww, man!
So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Oh yeah! I know.
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
Well, what about my stuff?
You don't have any stuff.
No.
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
Okay.
Take care.
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
All right, I'll pick that one.
That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
Oh, okay. The what?
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
Twenty percent.
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
Um-um, um-um.
What is it?
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
What?! What? What happened?!
And you were at this job for four years?
Ahhh!!
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
That's right.
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Your license?
That's Hanson.
Oops sorry, my mistake.
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
I'm not gonna gooo.
You're not going to go.
How, how, um how can you not be going?
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
Oh.
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
Well, yeah, this is the deal.
Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
Woah.
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
What was that?
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
Okay.
Okay!
Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Yeah. That's Daddy.
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
Ohh...
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
It's Pam.
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
You think so too?
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
What? Oh my God!
What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
Ow!
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
You can have the last piece, if you want.
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
Yeah.
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
You would think.
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
I called him.
Nooo.
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
Hello.
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
Take the bra off.
Okay.
Rachel is my girlfriend.
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Who?
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Sure.
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
I feel terrible, I really do.
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Yes.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
Yes, I do.
No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
I do not always have to be-okay, okay.
Jurassic Park could happen.
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
Oh yeah, there you go.
Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
I really like waking up with you.
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Thank you.
Yes.
How come we have one extra place setting?
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
Monica!
Are we ready to order?
Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
Wow, look at these prices.
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
Um, cake.
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Really? A purse?
It looks like a women's purse.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
All right, we should call somebody.
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
That is so not my motto.
Hey.
Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
Good.
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
Oh yeah, of course you don't!
No.
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!
We'll just see.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
I hope it's you.
Me too!
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
It's Erica.
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
I'm sorry!
Rachel, wait, wait.
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
I just did them.
What?
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Uhhhooo.
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Hm-m.
Are these the shoes?
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Morning. We ready to go?
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
I might know something too.
What's the thing you know?
I can't tell you what I know.
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't...
Right.
Sweep, sweep....
What? What?
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
But why does it even matter?!
Why does it matter so much to you?!
Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
Hey!
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
You are now.
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
Oh man.
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
That's-that's not Phase Three.
Well, I'm there too!
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
Pheebs! Sorry!
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Oh my God! My dog died!
What?!
Le Poo's still alive?!
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
See? I've even called Animal Control!
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
Animal Control.
You called Animal Control?
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
No! Joey!
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
Oh...
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
What?
Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?
Me too.
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
It does. It really and truly does.
It so does not!!!
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Iced tea.
Okay, anything for you sir?
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
Hey!
Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
You said she was bald.
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Beefsteak Charlie's?
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Nah, I got it.
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Yes, yes!
Me either...
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Nooo!
No-no-no-no, we're done.
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Me?!
No! I went with Mindy.
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Yeah?
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Great! Roomie!
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
Ohh, with who?
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Yeah.
You have a play date with a stripper?!
Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
Hi!
You ah, wanted to see me?
What?!
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Yeah.
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
Oh, Chantal!
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
Oh. Oh.
Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
Yeah, maybe.
Any luck?
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Alrightalrightalright. There.
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Why?
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Yeah.
Oh, from who?
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
I can scratch that right off.
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Eeaagh!
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Huh?!
So, how ya doin?
Yeah, well..
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
Wow... Wow!
Yeah.
Nooo, it wasn't.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Oh? Yeah! Sure!
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Oww!
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
How is that ever going to happen?!
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Hi!
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna...
I'm sorry!
Oh you don't have to be sorry. I'm...I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't...picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh...kiss good-bye? No? Okay.
What the hell was that?!
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
No kidding?
What?
I'd wait.
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds.
So we're a little late.
What?
I'm going commando, too.
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
You become friends after?
No, never done that either.
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
That's right.
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
No tongue.
Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!
Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Excuse me?
It's horrible.
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
Need uh, need a little hand there.
You really don't seem like you do. That's...
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
Hey!
Hey!
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Joey, what are you doing?
Just being friendly.
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Because it's my apartment!
How about, you're moving!!
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
No. No!
Hello, Rachel.
Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
Oh. Oh-oh.
Done!
You just finished?
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Oh, I already have one.
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Hey, I know I what I want!
What we want honey.
These are from Halloween three years ago.
Worth a shot, huh?
Look at this.
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
G'night.
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
No thank you for... Thank you.
Okay, let's go!
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
Oh, yeah!
Absolutely.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
Oh, that's true.
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Hey.
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
Look I told you...
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
It's breast milk.
So?
What is the big deal?
What did you just do?
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
I know! I know!
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
You found my book?!
Yeah I did!
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
Well, because of us! Because of our history.
Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
No!
No?
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
Heyyy.
We're hanging out.
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Fine, I'll go call her.
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Wow! This looks great!
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Got a job on a river boat?
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
Right.
Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Why are- why are you so tanned?
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
Me?!
I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Ohhh!
Why are we in bed together?
Yeah.
Really?!
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
You know, I think I might just.
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
It starts?
Okay!
Already?!
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
No.
Eww!
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
Great.
Relax, I'll fix it.
How did he do this?
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Pheebs?
Yeah?
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
Because I'm going to London.
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Oh my God, it was incredible.
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
Oh. Stop it!
So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
What?
I think he's stealing from me.
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
I love Jacques Cousteau!
I wanna gooooooo!
That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
What? Nothing.
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
Well what is it? Let me see.
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
Monica's wasted.
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Good ones?
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
Good morning!
I sure did!
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Why would I have the keys?
But I didn't.
Well, you should have.
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
I'm goin' home.
What?
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Ok, you weren't there.
Comin' through. Move, move.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
No! Not at all!
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Really?! We are?
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Hey.
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
We ended up having sex in his chair.
Oh, do I?
Uh huh.
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
You-you had what?
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Hey!
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
Hey!
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Green. To the green.
To the left, to the left- aww!
Ohhh... I'm fine.
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
Kitten?
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!
This bottle opener.
And?
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Hey! How'd the interview go?
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or...
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
Hey! We're here!
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
You told them he was missing?
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
Hey, thanks for talking to me.
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
What?
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
No-no! I-I...I found one.
Okay.
Sure. Do you need some floss?
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Noooo.
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
Any minute now.
Hey, this- Heyy...
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Pizza guy!
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Thunder being stolen!!
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
Um-hmm.
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
Okay.
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Yes, it was!
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Ha. Ha, ha.
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!
Hey!
Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
Hi!
Hey!
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so...
Yeah.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
So did that do anything for ya?
Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Hi!
Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
What does she do?
She's a waitress.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
What's 1922?
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
No.
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
What?
Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
Obviously not to Joey.
What?
Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
Because they're people.
But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
Rach...
Rachel...
Look, either help me or go.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
I thought it was $98.50.
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
I don't know what else to say.
I feel terrible, I really do.
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Vomiting stories are funny...
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
No!
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
Oh.
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
Hey!!
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Oh God, here we go!
What?
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Mr. Treeger.
Uhh, you said there was a party.
Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
What? A brain transplant?!
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Hi!
I can show you an ID if you want?
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
All right, let's do it.
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
Oh, fine! Take his side!
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
Yeah, but you didn't.
No, but it's-it's-it's hot!
I can't believe no one believes me!
I do, I believe you.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
Great!
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
Honey, I was wondering....
Hmm?
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
Hmm.
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Why do you need it?
Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!
Nooo, later.
Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!!
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Okay. I'll be right back.
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Look, either help me or go.
Fine. I'll go.
Sure. I'll help you.
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
Wow, that's-that's-that's incredible.
Uh-huh.
You are right there with Emily. And it's y'know, it's kinda like.... it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Hey!
Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Ohhh!!
Nope! Something else.
I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I...I really miss downstairs.
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
Oh.
What? Is it my breath?
Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
Yeah. Well, umm.....
Remember when we were in high school together?
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Got me.
Yeah.
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life.
Yeah, I know.
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Throw in the duck too!
What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
Look, we are not gonna...
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
But you guys came so close.
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
Hhhhiiiii.
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
I do the same thing.
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th.
So when are you getting married?
Oh May 15th.
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Gimme them!
You just wanna each take one?
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Well...
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
A couple of days.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
They had to have that specially made?!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Oh, you go out with him.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
Oh come on Ross!!
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Oh my God.
Can I see your license please?
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Hmmm, that's very cool.
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
Rachel!
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
How many you want?
One.
I bet two dollars.
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Really?! We are?
Ohh! That would be great.
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
NO!!!
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
Come on!
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Really? A purse?
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
I really do.
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Okay.
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
Yeah!
That's true.
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
That is not true!
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Bummer.
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
That cup is mine!
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
With Ross and my sister?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh there is no way.
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
What?
With a man?
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
You're back.
You two were married?!
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
We said seven!
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
So, does this come in another color or...
Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
I own this store.
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
I'm moving in.
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
You got ink on your lip.
Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh....
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
Yeah.
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
you don't have insurance?
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
I got itI'm getting it!
Thanks.
And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Uhh, rub it?
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
Time's up, now your dead.
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
It's not a library...
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Big time!
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
I mean, was it Gina?
Which one is Gina?
No, no, no, that's Dina.
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
Hey!
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
What's goin' on?
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Rachel, how did this happen?
Where?
At his apartment. Is this juice?
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
I make the decisions, and I say no.
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Okay.
I know I do.
Hi.
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
Hi!
Wow! How long were we arguing for?
No that's my assistant.
Is-is he coming?
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
All yours babe.
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
Really?!
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Yes I did.
Ohh. Ooh!
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Oh, look! Look! Look!
Surprise!!
That's the surprise!
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
How could you not tell us?
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
Alright!
Ni-chou chi-ma!
Hi!
Hi.
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Oh, I am sorry...
I gave you one job!
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
I just... can't do it.
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot
Okay.
Okay, good. Thank you. I'll be back shortly, all right?
All right. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Oh, well...
Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
You were at the coffeehouse!
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
Wh-You dated my sister!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Ahhhh!!
Hey, my Father's house does that!
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Hmm.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
What happened?
Noo. Why?
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Goodnight.
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
Naa, she's lyin'.
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Okay, what's up?
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
Yeah?
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Chandler told me.
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.
So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
What? What?
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Three of your five, what?
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
The fear?
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Closer than here?
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle.
Okay, your highness.
Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Where's all the tissues?!
Check out the ring.
Hi.
Hey-hey Pheebs!
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
This is my wedding.
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!
So?
Gloves?
Uhh, actually y'know what, I kinda-I have to take off.
Oh.
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
Ew-eww!! Undies!
Well, they're not mine!
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
You don't have any secrets!
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Ugh.
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.
Oh.
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!
Shh! Get me out of here.
Oh.
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Drum roll.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
Ohh! Me too!
Is-isn't it the best?
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Ohh, I would love too.
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Joey!
They know you know.
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
So umm, where are the other guys?
Fighting?!
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.
What?
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
Everybody smile.
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
Doctors are wrong all the time.
Well, yeah.
Definitely.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
Hi!
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
...I'm his
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Oh my God.
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
I bet two dollars.
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Oh, hi!
Hi!
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
But we should move quick.
Why?
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Oh my God! That's David!
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
No, don't worry about it.
No, you could've lost your job.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
God, he's good.
Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Hey!
Hey!
Yeah!
Subtle guys!
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
Hmm-mmm.
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
You've never asked a guy out?!!
No. Have you?
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
Yes, exactly!
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Well, I'd have to say gay.
Yeah? Why?
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
Hi!
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!
She said you gave her the razor!
Hey guys.
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
You look pretty tonight.
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.
We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
I had a bra.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
Our apartment is ready.
And that makes you angry because...
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Hey.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Phoebe, tell her!
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Ok, you win.
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
I have quarters!
Hey!
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Oh.
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it.
Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Hi!
Hi, I'm Joshua.
Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife...
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
Hey!
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
So umm, what's this book about?
You didn't read this one either?!
What?
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
What?!
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
You're welcome.
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot
Emily.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Okay.
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Pastrami.
Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
Yeah.
Up!
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
That's right.
Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
What?
Nothing, nothing.
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
What's wrong?
Oh no.
What party?
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Five.
Five.
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
Shut up.
I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
Wow! What do you do now?
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
You're jokin' right?
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
So?
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
You have other friends?
What?
With a man?
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
OK!
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
Mmmm, no.
Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
Um, cake.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
Oh good.
Thanks for your help.
Just call me Paul.
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Hi.
Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
Hi.
Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
You didn't get it?
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Nice try.
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
Chandler?
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Wha...
Is there? Is there someone else?
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Hey, big...
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
Yes I am!
Rach!
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
Why?
Why? Because of the government.
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
Oh-oh!
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Yeah. How 'bout that.
I really can't say.
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
Yes!
Frank Jr. Jr.!!
So gross!
Okay. You ready to push again?
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Hello?
Hello, is Ross there?
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
I don't have ten minutes!!
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
Hey.
What are you doing?
No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Hi!
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
Yeah.
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
No!!
Just get out! Now!!
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Umm, hi!
Hi.
She's doing her laundry.
What's that?
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
That's the stuff!
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
Bing! That's a great name.
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Don't do it.
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
What?
Excuse me?
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
That's great. Thanks Rach.
Rach, you're in my seat.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
Oh God, absolutely.
It's the museum again, can I, oh.
When?
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Yes, you can, very much.
Ahhhh!!
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
All yours.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
Oh!
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
They don't look any bigger than me!
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Oh.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
Who said anything about Christmas?
Hi.
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
That's too hard. Too hard!
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
No thank you.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
You're that stupid.
I am. I'm that stupid.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
Hi Pheebs.
Hi!
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
Yeah.
Wait, he's not here yet.
Yeah.
Alright.
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
Okay.
I'm not allowed to have soda.
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
Marry me.
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
Well, do you see any babies?
How do you feel?
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
Twenty percent.
Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
Hi, is Rachel there?
I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing.
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Huh.
I know.
The test is ready.
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?
Yeah.
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
Oh no.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
I, I don't have it.
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
Rosss...
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Yeah!
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
Well that I can believe.
Yay!
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
What are you talking about?
But you guys came so close.
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
Pheebs, that's great!
Oh, yay!
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
Why are they here?
I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
Yeah!
Yeah!
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Yeah, I heard it.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
I guess you weren't there.
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
Eldad, this is Rachel.
How are you?
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
I-Ohh!
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
Okay!
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
She seems really, really fun!
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
You could?
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
I guess so.
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Phoebe that's not true.
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
Has it been that long?!
Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
H-He's in China!
The country.
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Why would you want to do that?
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Hope you had a nice flight.
Ohh, it was the best!
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Got me.
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
I could, yeah, I can do that.
Yeah.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
That he doesn't exist.
Right.
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
Wow!
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Hey!
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
Oh. And what do you call that?
A moustache comb.
No.
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Petrie.
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Ross?
I'm here.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Now, we'll see.
Air hole! Air hole!!
The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
What's that?
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
Pretty much.
Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
Oh hello, Ross.
Hi, Mrs. Green.
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
Is it a meatball sub?
That is incredible! You are the master!
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Okay, I'll go!
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
What kinda noise?
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Uh-huh.
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
Okay.
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Hey Erica, c'mon in.
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Uh, yeah.
Y'know what, pretty good.
Yeah?
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
Okay. I'll miss you.
Isn't he great?
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Hello.
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
Ohh, good.
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
I used to wet my bed.
We both do that!
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
But I hired you!
What?
I am?!
Yeah!
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
Well, so do a lot of people.
Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
Okay! See you later!
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
You be okay?
Yeah.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Goodnight.
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Yeah.
Thanks. What photo album was it?
Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
Hey.
I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.
Thank you. Oww!!!! God!
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
Does it involve travel?
Noo!
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I want my money back.
Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Let me finish.
Oh.
Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Or you could end up with everything.
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Judy.
Who?
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
Monica, let it go.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
That yeti is one smooth talker.
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
No! Why?
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Why is Ross doing that?
DANGER!!!!
We should help him!
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Oh, thank God.
Hi.
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
What?
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Yeah.
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
What are you talking about? Keep it!
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
We're with you. We got it.
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
What are they?
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
I had to go with the odds Rach.
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
What?
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Hmm.
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Yeah.
Well honey, what about you?
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
Not from where I was standin.
where were you standing?
Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Joey...
You wanna make it 6?!
Hey!
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Wh?!
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
I don't know! Charity?
Ugh!
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Who is it?
It's Monica, open up!
Oww!
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Good, you guys are all here!
Hey! What's up?
Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
I know!
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
How? I don't have any money.
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Like what?
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
No.
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
Oh.
So, all right.
Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
This body?
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Great nap.
It really was.
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Happy birthday.
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Rach? What are you doing?
It's a diaper commercial.
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
Ugh, she is a slut!
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
He's taking off her coat!
Oh, this is just terrible.
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
What was the book?
The big book of childrens' names.
Yeah.
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
You just said it!
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
Eh, no problem.
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
I'm sorry.
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Ross?
Yeah?
No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
Ohh, what is in that?
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
Hey, hey, no, oh oh.
Run Phoebe run.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
I don't know, I don't know.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
I've never done that.
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
Really?! You think that will work?
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
We were on a break!
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
One more game?
Oh yeah!
I'm sorry!
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
What?!
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Hey.
Hey.
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
Go, go, go!
Oy!!
What's with all this sand?
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Oh, that sounds great.
Come on over here, sweetheart.
I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
I am.
You really think so?
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
A dollar?
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
Yeah.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Thank you.
Right.
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
Uh-huh, what?
Oh!
...how about I move in with you?
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Okay.
Well I just came... I just needed to tell you... Congratulations.
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It's Phoebe again.
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Thank you. Mon?
Hmm?
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
Hi.
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
And that's funny, why?
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
Chandler!!
Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
What?
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Went out with Joey.
No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
Wow! I did not see that coming.
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
Hello.
What did he say?
Something about hi.
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Hey!
Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
Where are you gettin' this?
Oh. Oh.
Joey...
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
Oh...
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
But...
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
How is that the silver lining?
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
What? That's terrible!
No-no, we do it every year!
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
Why didn't you get it?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
Hello.
Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Monica, leave him alone!
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
How much did you pay for that?
Yeah? How much?
A thousand bucks.
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Can I do it to you?
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
Okay.
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
Rachel!
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much.
You told me you didn't see anything.
She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
Hi!
Is uh, is Monica here?
I think Chandler's gone.
What?!
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Yeah! Yep.
Ohh, I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
It is? Really?
Yeah, sweetie.
No.
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Just the matter of ...payment?
Jack used to handle the finances!
Sure...
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Oh, come on!
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
It's exactly like it sounds.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Oh, all right.
Look I was going to tell you!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
We need a hat..
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
Hi Kim.
Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
You and Ralph?
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
We'll see.
Well, thank you for lunch.
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Its still there!
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Oh, "you do, do you"?
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
That's great! That's wonderful!
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. Okay.
All right.
1...2...3!
Ready?
Uh-huh.
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
Oh yeah? Okay.
Okay.
Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Oh yeah, why not?
Pheebs?
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
What? Why? Where are you?
I'm still on the set!
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
Oh! It's you. Hi.
Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
So listen uh, I know you and I haven't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Oh.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
Rach, he's not an ex-con.
I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Okay.
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
That guy's still doing that?!
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
What's your problem?
Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Uh.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
I thought it was Chandler!
What? What?
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
Hey, Pheebs.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Your company has a fine foods division?
Well, so what does he do?
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
Any luck?
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Now she's passed.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
So, um, did she...
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Get in here!!!
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
Hey guys!
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
You know the words! You are so into this!
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
All right, then show me some manly moves.
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Do what, do what?
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
Yeah that's better than my way.
Aww, man!
Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Night.
Uh-huh!
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
Well it stupid, unfair question!
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
What?! Oh.
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
How often do you read it?
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Hey guys!
Hey!!
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
Really? I only had two glasses.
I just had a glass.
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Yeah, I filled them out last night?
Hey Rachel!
Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up?
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Wow.
Yeah.
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
But, you are.
What?
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
There you go.
So, have you kids eaten yet?
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?
Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya.
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Come on Rach, let's go.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
I'm a little embarrassed.
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Gimme this.
Brides magazines?
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
Okay Rach, but...
Op! You're peeping!
Look I told you...
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
But...
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
No! I do want to!
Oh, she does want to.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
Vanilla?!
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Yeah, come here!
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Okay, good bye!
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
Okay.
Did I, uh, did I miss something?
Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
I don't know.
You were supposed to tell her!
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
It was fine.
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Hey, where is everybody?
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
At this?!
Just go get some! Go!
Okay.
Okay? Whoa, wait!
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Alright!
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Sure, okay.
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Okay!
Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
Thank you!
Some uh, some visual aides.
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
Aw-awww!
I don't think she'd like that.
Oooooh...
I don't think so dear.
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
That's correct.
Sure.
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
Hey.
So it's looks like we're the first ones here.
Yay!!
Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
We were on a break!
Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
What?!
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
All right, I'll do it.
Yes.
I'm Rachel Green.
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room.
Hey. Oh, I'm sorry, this is Cailin.
And! Break!!
Okay.
I'll join you.
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
Me too.
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
Alright.
So, I figured it out.
What?
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Then you should have said something before I met her.
There was never a good time.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
I know.
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
Well, we were very young when we had her.
Oh. We?
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
Mazel tov!
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
You're gonna what?
I'm gonna tell Mom.
Crazy.
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
May I help you?
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Tell him.
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
Hah!
That true, I am flaky.
Yeah, totally.
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
That's what I said.
Look, maybe we should go?
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
Why are you so jealous of me?
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Yeah.
They are gonna love me.
Oh!
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Well then, you should look with us.
Why?
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
You don't say.
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Who?
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
Hello.
Hi! It's me.
Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
Ross! Stop that!
Ah, I'm sorry.
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Yeah!
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
Okay.
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
We need a hat..
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
Alright, fine. I'll call you back.
Good.
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Say that to him and you're golden.
Hey!
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
What?
That's cool. Cool.
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
Oh my God!
Just a bug.
Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
That's weird.
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
Joey, I really don't...
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
What?
I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
Yes, you're having a boy!
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
She is so great! I miss her.
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Hi.
May I see your boarding pass?
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
I was not!
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
Pick me!!
No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
Y'know, I never saw that.
Ooh, it was only okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
Let go!
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
I gotta go.
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Oh, like that's a word.
...Pheebs?
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
It won't come off!
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Joey!!
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Oh, I'd like that.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Hmm.
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
You did it twice?
Okay...
Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Okay. Have a benefit.
Hey!
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
Ooooh.
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
So did you ask him?
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Oh Fonzie.
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Damn, I forgot you were here.
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
Yeah.
When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
All right that's it, school is in session!
My God! Is this a gym card?
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Okay, there.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
Nooo, it wasn't.
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Ohh that's great!
Yeah!
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Well, start looking.
Wow.
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
No, I just, I fell down.
You know, a party, or--
What party?
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
Hm-mmm.
Why?!
I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
No.
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Yeah.
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
Eh, do you believe that?
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
Okay...
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
What?
I don't know.
Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
My hands?
Yeah.
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Yeah! That guy's all right!
What?
Y'know, all the women.
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
It's a diaper commercial.
Pizza delivery!
I'll get it! I will get that!
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Thank you.
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
Heard what?
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
Twenty-four actually.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
Pop it in.
I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
What's wrong with people having sex?
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Okay, who wore those?
Not bad.
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
...pig...pig man!
Yes, good! Ok...
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
I'll be out in a second.
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Good.
Yeah, I-I really do. Hey! This-this was a gift?!
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Oh my-Oh good God!
Baking it didn't help, huh?
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Okay.
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
How is that ever going to happen?!
I know why!
No you don't know why!
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
Oh. Oh-oh.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Okay no, you do it.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
That's him.
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
I had a really nice time tonight.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
What is the emergency?!
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
Thank you.
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
Uh-oh.
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
One.
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
Look. Look, I wasn't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
You don't?!
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
We haven't eaten yet!
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
What are you smiling at?
Yeah, right.
Hello.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Oh, well thank you in advance.
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
I love it, when we share.
You're okay there?
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
Oh.
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
With you?! Yeah right!
All right.
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
Really?
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
Delaware! Delaware!
All right.
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
You are so cute.
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
No!
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
Hey!
What do you got there?
What are you doing tonight?
Huh? Uh...
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
Okay. Let's bring it in.
Here you go.
That almost hit me in the face.
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Hey.
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Rach?
Yeah?
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
You're good. These are not.
Yeah.
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
How about 600 and these earrings?
They prefer it if I don't barter.
Well you can split it with another credit card.
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Come on.
And you didn't marry him because...?
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
Hi.
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Oh, Ross...
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Oh, you're kidding.
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
We don't, really.
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Fine.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
What?! What?! What?!
I guessed 20,000!
What?! I don't have 20,000!
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
I'm just trying to help you, move on.
Petty...
Petty...
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Just pickle.
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
We kinda broke up this morning.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
He does not look happy.
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
So?
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Can't do it, can you?
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
What?
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
Oh, like you don't already have everything.
Ow! Ow!
All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
I promise.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Helps a little.
Yeah, have a seat.
I'm so sorry.
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
That's what you say at the end of a date.
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
The guy still won't put out, huh?
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
So, Monica, what do you do?
Good for you.
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
I'll help you throw out your purse.
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
Joey?
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
That's not good.
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?

You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
What up?!
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Yeah, see ya.
Hey, thank you so much.
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
Hey.
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Okay.
Great.
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
She seems really, really fun!
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
Who you what? Who you what?!
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Oh my god.
Oh my god good?
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
Hi Pheebs!
Are you moving out?
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
We haven't eaten yet!
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
I can't tell you that, no.
Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
The small one.
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Your work makes me sad.
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
So, did I hear Poconos?
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Yeah, that's a big step.
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
Yeah.
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Uh-huh!
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
What?!
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
I don't think so.
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
What?! You say that to kids?!!
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
You picked a great couch.
Yeah?
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
God I'm just a horrible person.
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
Hello, excuse me.
What.
I'm talkin'!
I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Yeah, I do know.
Ick, you were eavesdropping.
Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?
Yeah...
Hey!
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Ohh, that's a good one.
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
How about, you're moving!!
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Great! Monica's moving!
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
Okay. But wait!
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
You got a tattoo?
Lemme see.
Well?
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
That'd be good.
Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you.
Oh, thank goodness!
Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
Happy for you.
No, happy for you!
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
What? Guys, I'm not.
C'mon, this is us.
Waitressing?
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
Really?
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
You're not laughing.
This time it's not so funny.
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Oh that's great!
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
I, I don't know.
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
Alright.
Alright...
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
Y-sure!
Okay.
Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Why would you want to do that?
Rach, there is a decent place to...
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
Oh!
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
My mom will.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
What?
It is our first official date. Our first date.
Hey, yo.
What's tonight?
Uh, hello.
Hi.
How does going to a strip club help him better?
What's Phase Two?
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Because there are naked ladies there.
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
How, how, um how can you not be going?
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
Who is it?
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
For what?
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
You al-you already had it?
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Its back in cage!
Cage closed?
Ohh. Mmm.
Hi.
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
You're kidding! Where? Where?
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Hello!
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
Hey!
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
I know.
What, so what are you gonna tell him?
Huh.
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
A little bit, yeah.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
What were you doing?
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Hey!
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Happy birthday!!!
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
Fine.
No. Really?
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
No I don't.
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Hey!
Hey!
Yeah! That guy's all right!
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
No. Why?
Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Oh God.
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
You okay?
Yeah.
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Well, here's your phone doctor.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
Ross!
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
How do you feel?
Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
Some moms do that.
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
It's a woman.
So talk to her.
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
Ohh, I thought that you....
Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
I don't care, she slept with me.
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
Okay. We'll be right back.
So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Do you?
Okay.
And stop saying that! I hate that!
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
Say you're sorry.
What're you gonna do?
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Many are scheduled to appear.
Okay, I'll go!
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Noo.
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
Because that would be crazy?
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
No anchovies.
With ah, extra anchovies.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
Good morning Rachel.
Went out with Joey.
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
No! I mean he's nice.
Yeah.
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Yes I am.
Yeah.
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Because I knew you were lying!
All right, come here!
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
Sure.
Yep?
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
No suds, no save. Ok?
What's goin' on?
Was your basket on top?
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
Yeah!
Oh, I know...
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Okay, that we may be able to do.
How?
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
Yeah!
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
All right.
What's the matter, Pheebs?
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
Monica.
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Yeah!
Ooh, now you lost me.
You stole the phone!
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
We are there!
What, what are you laughing at?
Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
Bye!
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Oh right.
Yeah.
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.
Get the what?
What're you doing?
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
Oh no!!
No.
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
Ohh! Okay!
Come on!
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
Oh yeah? Okay.
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Anymore!!
Okay.
Yes, at 4:00.
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
Shut up!
Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
Oh please...
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so...
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys...
Oh, well, that's great!
Yeah! Yeah!
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Hi.
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
Yes but my mom got me this job.
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Fighting?!
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
What're you gonna do?
You don't have the guts.
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Well, what's the job?
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Is Tony Randall dead?
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
You have some life here, sweetie.
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
It's horrible.
Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Here we go again.
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
Oh, that is better.
Are we in London?
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
Yeah.
Well, what period is it from?
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or...
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
Oh hi!
Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere.
No.
All right!
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Ummmmmmmm, no.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
I'd better get back to my desk.
My what?
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
Great!
Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
I guess so.
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Hi, thanks for coming.
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Hey, you're not Kip!
Do you even know who Kip is?
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
Ohh!
No, I haven't.
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Sure.
If this is your idea of sexy talk?
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Can I please be there when you tell her?
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
What is this? What's going on?
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
I know.
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
Um-um, um-um.
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
You okay?
How's my Bing-a-ling?
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Never!
You never come into this office again!
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Oh... Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
What?
Eh?
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Oh, you're...
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Orange juice.
Ha-ha!
They have another guess.
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it.
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
Okay, you go grab it!
I saw it.
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
Okay.
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
Oh my God you stole her award!
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Colorado.
Ah, what good are you.
Okay.
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!


C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
You bet! What's the part?
Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
Will you quit hoggin' it!
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
HI!! Hi!
What?! What?!
Actually, it looks really good.
Get in here!!!
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Rachel! You okay?
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Ohhhhh!
Just go over and say hi.
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
Whip it out, whip it out.
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Hey.
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .
How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
Yeah.
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Oh my God! Look at this!
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
And did you?!
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
That guy, he burns me up.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Oh.
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Well I-I-I'm not moving.
What?!
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
Just call me Paul.
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Oh!!
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
Well believe it baby!
Well I-I-I'm not moving.
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
You need to get out of my chambers.
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Just one cheek.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
That's romantic.
C'mon touch it.
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Great! Thanks!
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
God. You seem really, really nice.
Okay, bye-bye.
All right, here we go.
Okay.
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
Hi.
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
What did, what did he say?
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Refill?
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
You mean like, music?
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Take thee, Emily...
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
Uhh...Shall I go on?
Yes, yes, do go on.
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Okay, good luck with that.
Hey!
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
What?
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
You know what?
What!!?
Hello! Here we go!
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Hey!
Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
You don't?!
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Well thank you, you too.
Thanks.
Well sure. But I get married all the time so...
Ohh...
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
It's Pam.
Aw-awww!
I don't think she'd like that.
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
The fake kind!
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
You still love me?
Noo.
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
Thanks.
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
About what?
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Yes.
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
The balloon?
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
Hi, hi can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
What?
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
What?
No! You should've read it yourself!
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
No!
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Oh come on, not again.
Hmm.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
No. Really?
My chair heels itself.
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Oh no!
It's my new apothecary table!
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
What? What's wrong?
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
They're not listening too me?
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
I think you look fine.
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Huh?
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Hey!
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
Isn't that a line from the show?!
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Hey you!
Hey, come on in.
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
I can't believe this is happening.
I know.
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
OK. Oh, oh, oh.
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
Huh.
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Great! Monica's moving!
I am not!
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
No Phoebe I am mad!
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
No I don't.
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
What happened?
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
So?
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
Yeah.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
Well, that could take a while.
I got the time to get to know Julie.
I got time.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Okay.
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
Pheebs, did...you want a cookie?
Thank you so much.
I haven't really had any yet.
Hey guys!
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that....
Ross? What's with the neck?
You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
You stole the phone!
No I didn't!
No.
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Did you two...
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Anymore!!
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Like what?
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Jill?
I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry...
Right! But, I am sorry.
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
Here it comes.
This is a great picture.
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
You mean, we-you and me?
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Shake it off.
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bye house!
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Mon?
Mon?
Wait a minute, look.
What?
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Maybe on some level.
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Susan, he looks just like you.
Thanks.
I know, I still am one of these.
Ross, can I?
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Umm, yum!
It's Danny.
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
But...
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
All right, let's go!
You're welcome.
We were on a break!
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Oh!
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Thanks for being born.
Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
Now I love you even more.
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Hi!
Hey.
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
I don't know.
Ah-ha! Too cocky!
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
That's okay.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
Hit me!
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Oh, hey!
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
I'd love to!
What?
My God!
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Thank you.
See he's nice. Right?
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
His new girlfriend!
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
Call.
I'm in.
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
No! I'm not okay!
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
Ross?
I'm here.
What? Great, now I'm having a baby.
What?
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
You guys!
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Well you said you couldn't go out so....
You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
Oh-oh, you lie.
What you don't think I'd go up to her?
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
What did you just say?
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
F-hah.... flennin....
Oh.... my God.
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
I-I-I-I did?
This body?
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Good luck.
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Just a waitress?
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
Whatever.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
I know.
Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
Nothing I do means anything, really.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
People, people, people.
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
Right.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Oh umm, uh we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
That'd be great, thanks.
Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?!
Melissa!
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Hey.
That was gonna be my opener.
I thought that was just a rumour.
True story.
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
What?
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Yes it is!
Why is it inside out?!
How much did you pay for that?
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Okay, quick and painful.
Oh, what? What-what?
Y'know Marcel?
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Still thinking about it huh?
Oh, who cares?
I care!
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
If we broke up, and I lost you...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I know.
Where's all the tissues?!
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
Well honey, what about you?
What?
No.
Come on you gotta have one!
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say...
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Just, y'know out.
What were you doing?
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
You wanna go down to the office right now?
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Hey!
Oh.
Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
Oh.
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
Whose is it?
Whose is it?
I don't want to say.
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
No. A break from us.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Done.
Hi Steve!
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Show time!
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
Yeah.
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
I like Ross.
Ohhh! Kids!
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Did I, did I even treat?
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Erin.
Hey Rachel.
What's wrong?
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
Don't get me started on that.
I was not flirting.
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
This is totally your fault!
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Hi! How are the Gellers?
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
Tell me about it!
It does sound appealing.
Oh, I never could do it.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
I'll do it!
Okay, I gotta go to work.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
Hey, it's my list.
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
I know.
Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Got me.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Looks like a fun gang.
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
What do you mean?
And she just gave you this?
Yeah!
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
What?
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
It's work.
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Ohh-ha-ha!
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
Really?!
Ohh!
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
Rachel.
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Why aren't you home yet?!
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Let it go!!
Hey!
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
Nooo!
Then you're not invited.
Oh-whoa, what party?
Well umm...
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
Hiya.
What is going on here?
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Okay, hold my crawler.
Okay.
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Uh, good.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Ohh! My God! Barry!!
You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
Surprise! Look who's back!
Hey Pheebs!
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Why to save your dignity my man.
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
In your mouth?!
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
How'd the lecture go?
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
That you're not funny or sexy?
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
No.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
Hey.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Yes but my mom got me this job.
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Got me.
Remember when we were in high school together?
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
Ow!
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Rach!
It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
What?
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
Ohh. Ouch.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Since when?
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Yeah, I know!!!!
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Hey!
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
All right, maybe it means that too...
Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Her ankle is what you're watching?
She's just doing her job!
You sick bastards!
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
What?
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Thank you.
Okay, let me just change.
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
What is going on here?
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
Oh God!
Argue with that.
Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
I know that!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Your work makes me sad.
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
Bye!
Bye!
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
I did not!
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
I wish I had smoked for my career...
That's so gross!
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
You will?!
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Hmm.
Hey.
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Okay.
Not even close.
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
All right!
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Yeah, you didn't get one.
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Ohh, hi, Kim.
Hi Rachel.
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Ok, that's enough.
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Yeah, I heard it.
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Y'know what? You are right?!
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
I guess so.
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
Okay.
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
Yeah baby!
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
Yeah, he's head of the department.
All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Joey you broke my chair!!
Your chair?!
So, there was no miracle?!
No Joe, no miracle.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
Ohh, okay.
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Yes!
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Yeah! No?
A kiss? What are you talking about?
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
A little bit, yeah.
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
You are just like Jack.
...Jack from downstairs?
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
They had to have that specially made?!
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Uh-huh.
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
What?
I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
What do you mean?
Smell familiar?
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
What?! Over a stupid room!
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Hi!
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Oh.
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
And a date with a man!
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
I did, but that was really fun.
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Uh-huh.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Okay!
Okay!
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Well, it's better than us deciding.
No! Coins hate me!
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
You had no relationship!!
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Amazing!
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
So, will you talk to him?
I don't know Rach.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Chandler? A word.
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Oh, okay.
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
That was me.
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Oh, she's gonna love that!
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Er, yeah, it's mine.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
And what will that be on the side of?
And for you?
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
And then he did.
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
No, women are welcome to play.
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
Hey!
Hey, Rach, how was work?
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
I don't know.
Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?
OK. Hold my board.
Atta boy.
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't...
What? What?
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
I don't know. The left one.
Which ones?
Hey.
Hi.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
It's so secluded up here.
I know. I like it up here.
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Bye.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Oh my God!
Wow!
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Okay.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Hah!
That true, I am flaky.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
All right, then you owe me $350.
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
Ohh, I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
Why are you yelling?
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
Huh?
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
Nothing?
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
You're not gonna mess it up.
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Ohh!
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Crap.
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Okay! See you later!
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Ahhhh.
Oh. And how was the date?
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Ahh.
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
What?!
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
So Joey, you okay?
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Hey.
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
Right?
Nope.
I don't know why you just don't say left.
Okay, go to the left. The left!
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Well ah, actually...
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.
It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Hey guys!
Hey!!
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
Well there's an idea!!
Yeah!
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
Tell it again. Seriously.
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Nothing, why?
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
And heels.
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
Oh yeah.
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Yeah! Sit!
You okay?
Do I?
'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
See now it feels like Christmas!
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
Hey you guys.
Hey Joe what's up?
Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
Hey.
Hey.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
I'm just trying to help you, move on.
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
That's what you say at the end of a date.
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
We?
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
No.
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
Not a problem.
Thanks.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
They're male nurses.
Not in my head.
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Okay then!
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Oh great!
Hello?
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
Ohh...
You okay?
You mean, we-you and me?
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
What a nice story!
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Yeah, take your time.
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
So?
Why do you care?
Because they're people.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Oh, yeah.
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Yeah!
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
If this is your idea of sexy talk?
What contracts?
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
That sounds great.
Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Can we just start throwing things in?
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
What?!
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
And thank you, for that.
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
Same difference.
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Alan.
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Who are these men?
Men. I guy I know.
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
Good day for married people huh?
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...
Blow it.
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Oh fine.
Ready? Wrestle!
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Joey's not going.
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
What?
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Oh, please.
What? Honey.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
You are ready to make a commitment!
Whoa! Don't know about that.
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Thank you.
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
Charity?
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I...I really miss downstairs.
Well hello! I'm Ross!
Good luck to ya!
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
I don't know.
You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
It was nice to meet you.
Take care.
You like that do ya?
Oh yeah.
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Just sit over there!!
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
Oh my God.
What is with your nose?
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
Yeah?
..Naughty!
Right, I'll see you guys later...
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
NO!
No?
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Chicken? Chicken boy!
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Uh.
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
No.
Twelve dollars an hour.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Done.
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
Monica?!
I'm just trying to spice it up!
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Oooohh that's interesting.
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
That wouldn't help me.
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
Ok?
Ok.
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Done!
Let me finish.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
Surely you can think of something good.
What?
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Okay, who's next?!
No-o-o! No way!
Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend... No!
Yes!
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
I am so sorry.
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
Aww, not right now.
Oh, but that's okay.
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Is there a puppy here?
You don't like puppies?
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
Uh-hmm.
Congratulations.
What?
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Oh. Thank you.
That's no problem.
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
That is amazing.
Congratulations.
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Funny book?
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
What line?
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
Hey Ross!
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Uhh, hang in there?
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Why are you yelling?
Hi, honey.
See you later.
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
Naked alone time.
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
All you had to do was buy the card!
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
What?
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Gooood morning!!
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
Surprise!
I was in charge of cups.
Oh, okay, not so weird.
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
Why would you kill his fish?
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
Yeah.
Wait, he's not here yet.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Fine! We went out.
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
What's going on?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Well, but, but. . .
E-except, except that what?
No, no, ACC-cept that.
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
We have to get her a present?!
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
Cassie?!
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
Really.
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Hey! How'd it go?
You did the right thing.
I don't like this anymore.
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!!
What? What?
Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
It's Joshua.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
I can give it a shot.
Stick to your side!
Hey, come on now!
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Ooh great! Very Monica.
And chili!
Both!
We're paying for this y'know.
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Hiii.
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Pancho Vila?
Yeah!
Hey, you wet my pants!
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
I know honey, I'm sorry.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Hey, what happened to you?
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Oh, that is so sweet!
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
All right, all right.
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Oh!
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Well, h-how is this like that?
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
I was thinking Chinese food.
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
But what?
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Right!
Y'know-thanks!
Yeah, well...nah.
What? Wait, what?
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
What?
I feel great. In fact! What?
Oh, I'm sorry.
There it is.
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
Oh my God!
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
I think I need a drink.
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
What do you think?
Huh. Yeah?
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Uh-oh, busted!
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
Go on.
And Milton Berle has a...
Ohh, not compared to you.
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
What?!
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Okay. Sorry.
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Good morning.
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Ohh that's nice.
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Well, the duck...
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Yes.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.
Ohhhhh!
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Is that so?
Yeah.
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Hey!
Hey!
Why? Why would you do that?
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Oh, I know...
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Uh--
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
What's the charity?
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Oo! When's her birthday?!
I don't know Rachel, why?
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
Well thanks!
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
You can't, because of the new skylight!
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
Are you kidding?!
No!
No.
Joey!
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
Then what is it?
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
Sure.
Oh-oh, yeah.
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Rach...
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Yeah?
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Okay.
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Just please stop!
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Now I love you even more.
Surprise.
Happy birthday sweetie.
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Foot rubs for a month!
Freedom!
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
Sophie sit!!
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Okay. Umm...
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Someone like an...angel?
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
The Waltham Residence.
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
No, forget it.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
All right.
Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
We're sorry.
Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
Aw what are you?! A detective?
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
What is this? What's going on?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Joey's!
Okay...
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
Phoebe, come on that's silly.
All right, so let's switch.
Okay.
Okay.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
No! Barry and Mindy.
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
Ohh.
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Because, he's my friend.
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Your make-up!
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Hey! I call her!
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
He asked you out?!
Saucy!
What are these?
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Are you serious?
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Well, either that or uh...
With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
What do you need help for?
Oh God!
Argue with that.
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Hmmm!
Oh my God!
Behind you?
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Hi! Rachel Green's office.
You must be Hilda.
Phoebe! That's a great name.
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Hi!
Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you.
Hi!
What's up? You're voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
Great!
Yeah! Sit!
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
And you're okay with that?
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
That was not funny!
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
No.
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
Say you're sorry.
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Hmm.
Yeah.
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
Hey.
What's going on?
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
Oh that's so sweet.
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
That-that's bad?
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
Ross.
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
I need something sweet.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
In a bad way?
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
And we didn't have sex.
Tell me about it.
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Oh!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
Apartment pants?
Yeah, you never heard of them?
Huh? Oh, I got this--this!
A pajmena?
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
Well, somebody should.
Look uh, if we're gonna do this...
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
Who is it?
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
I didn't read it.
Yeah.
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
Yeah me too.
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
Hey!
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
No, look, don't touch that!
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
I care!
And so do I.
Okay. Sure.
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Aww, is it broken?
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
Hi.
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
What, what incident?
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Ohh, ohh.
When, when were you... under me?
OK, I need to lie down.
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
Monica bang!
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
You okay?
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Won't-won't that take longer?
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
Its still there!
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
No that could kill her.
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
I'm not listening to you!
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Excuse me?!
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
Who?!
In Human Resources!!!!!!
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
I make the decisions, and I say no.
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Well...
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Obviously.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Yeah! Yep.
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Well, people are different.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
What?
Me.
Well, thank you for giving it back.
Hello?!
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
I don't know, you might be the first one.
Rach, did you check the machine?
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
What?!
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Me and Chandler?!
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
You really don't seem like you do. That's...
Well, what was supposed to happen?
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Dr. Burke will see you know.
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
See ya!
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
You.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
We will.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Every year.
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
All right.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
She lets you borrow them.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
What else?
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
That's a hernia.
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Yes that would have made more sense.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
Come where?
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
O-kay!
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Well you did a little bit.
Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
What?
Huh.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Is there a Julio here?
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
I can't say.
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Yes! Totally!
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
Good night.
Men are such idiots.
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Good day for married people huh?
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
Try telling my wife that.
Okay to come in?
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Said what? Exactly.
That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Say more things like that.
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
You guys ready fore the movies?
Man! They cannot get enough!
Okay, pick a card.
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Rach...
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
We'll be waiting for you...
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
What?
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
What?
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
What?
Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Well, the lighting was okay.
And I have costumes.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
What, that little thing at the prom?
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
Happy birthday sweetpea.
Daddy.
Well, we could count again.
I can't believe this is happening.
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
Could we be more white trash?
How desperate am I?
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
How come?
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
You had no relationship!!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Would you let me talk.
Did you just flick me?
Quit flicking
Ow, you stop flicking.
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
What?
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
This woman's living my life.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
I have absolutely no idea.
That's... that's classic.
If you want, I'll do it.
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Bathroom's up there.
Great.
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
So I guess it's Joey then!
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
Hmmm!
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!

There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
Okay.
Okay.
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Yeah you did.
Okay.
Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
Hey.
Hey.
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Why not?
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
What? Who?
Phoebe.
Ohh, I don't think so.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
Ohh!
Oh my God!
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
I can show you an ID if you want?
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
Oh, that must be it.
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
What?!
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
She's right in there.
Hey, Chandler!
Bummer.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Do you wanna start telling secrets?
No!
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
You have other friends?
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
Okay, I have a wedgie.
Okay, that is all you.
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Move!
Uh... yay!
Thanks!
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
I'm so sorry you're sick.
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
I have not been sick in over three years!
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
Yeah right.
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
I did.
Yeah?
Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
What?
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
What?
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?
Do the claws again.
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
What?! What else did he say?
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
All right. Fine.
Yowzah!!!
Aww, come on.
That's it. Ow!!!
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Here let me...
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
You got ink on your lip.
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
Stay well.
Rach! Rach!
Oh, hi!
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
You promised you would break up with her!
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Uh-huh!
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
She is a kook.
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Ohhh!
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Hey Joey!
Erin! Still here!
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Why's that?
I don't think I should say.
Okay.
'Kay.
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Right.
Oh? Hello you.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Oh good, you're all up.
Oh yeah, that's over.
What?!
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
What the? What...
A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Just get away from me!
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Whe-where did he put it?!
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Yeah.
Helps a little.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
Why not?!
Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
What are you the memory woman?
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
Okay!
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
See ya!
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Oh, that's great!!
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Yeah.
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
Yes!!!
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Sure. Joey...
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
How's it going with her?
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Hi, Josh.
Hi.
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
Oh hey! How was your audition?
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Yay!
There you go.
Oh, that is amazing!
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
Oh.
I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda..... y'know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.
Come here.
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Yeah right.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Yes!
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
There was never a good time.
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
Oh.
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
Thanks!
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Really?!
I just, I thought Joey was there.
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Do you got your gracious loser face?
Yeah.
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
On TV?! Yeah!
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Hey!
Vince is a fireman.
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Rach, there is a decent place to...
No. No. No.
No?
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
Hey, this is hollow.
What?
No, don't look directly at them!
What?
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.
I can't imagine why.
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
How about a scone on the house baby?
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
Nice try.
I don't know.
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
What?
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
I got time.
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
Well, in a nutshell. . .
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
: Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
OK, then get me your purse.
OK, here you go. Good luck.
...teen!
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
What is it?!
I can't believe we're living here!
What?! What-what is it?!
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
Sure. Do you need some floss?
Oh here's a whole bunch.
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
I don't use a curling iron.
Well someone does.
It could've been a hair straightener.
Oh.
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Still no luck.
Do you want me to check again?
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
This bicep?
Well it's not flexed right now!
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Oh.
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
Really?
Yeah.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Not unless different means the same.
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
...Dinah?
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
Huh umm...
What's the matter?
Rach, he's not an ex-con.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Sorry.
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
Oh, thank God!
Did you get your money back?
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
What am I gonna do, huh?
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
Hey.
Hey.
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
A mirror?
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Really?
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
What?
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...
Yeah!
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
Oh, is that against the rules?
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
What did he say?
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
We?
Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
Ah.
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Oh, hey!
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
Oh, great. This is just...
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
Hey!
Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
You look fabulous honey, you really do.
Yeah? Are you sure, really.
I, I, I'm hideous.
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Wow.
Lucky sixes....
Hi!
And Joey....
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
But if...
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
Yeah!
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
Everybody!!
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Is this about Mark?
Oh my God.
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
Get out, get out of my apartment.
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Your own boat?
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
What?
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
Yeah.
Tell me everything.
Hey guys.
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
I love that movie.
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
Uh-huh.
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
Really?
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
Here's your lemonade.
I didn't order lemonade.
But...
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
You are beautiful.
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
Here.
Oh! Thank you!
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
I've got some bad news.
What?
Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
Actually, it's kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
So did you read your evaluation yet?
No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
A joke they would appreciate?
I'm thinkin' no.
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Ooh, okay... good.
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
That is amazing.
Congratulations.
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Really? From who?
Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
Yeah. Here you go.
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
I was her accountant four years ago.
Ohhhh!
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Well no.
Miracle!
Someone like an...angel?
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Right.
You like it right?
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
What contracts?
Like what?
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Rach?
Okay, I bought a boat.
You bought a boat?
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
Many are scheduled to appear.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Get down?
...And boogie!
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
Are you close with them?
No-no, they're not very nice people.
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
Do what?
Put all my money in me.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
Why? Did you write it?
Well ah, actually...
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
That won't go with this dress though.
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
YOU KNOW?!!!
What's going on?
Ohhh!!!
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
Really!
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
Hey.
Hey.
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Oh, thanks.
You okay over there?
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
Hey!
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
God bless the chickpea.
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
I used to wet my bed.
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
Okay whatever.
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'
What?
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
No.
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
Why did you look at me when you said that?
Well, I guess now we can't go.
You know what? You're right.
Fine.
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Really?
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
It sure is.
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
Yeah.
We just want you to think it through.
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
I might've said that. Why is that funny?
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
You're back.
You two were married?!
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Hey. Morning, dear.
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
Goodnight.
Oh, no no, I am.
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
Why would he turn off the TV?
Oh no-no-no-no!
We don't know what could make this go away.
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Excuse me?
Yeah?
And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
I can't imagine why.
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
Morning, Ross.
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
What-what is it, what is it?
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
What?
Why?
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
You did it twice?
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
No!
With extra pulp?
Yeah!!
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Okay..
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
You just thought of that in there?
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
You're on the phone!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Shut up, Joey!
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Art lover!
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Well...
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
You fell asleep?!
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
FINE BY ME!!
Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
But what about Phoebe?
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
Uh--
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Yeah.
Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Right.
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
Please, just a little bit off the back.
I'm still on "no."
No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
What's goin' on?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Oh. Yeah?
Wow, that's-that's-that's incredible.
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
Art it is.
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
Hi.
Hey!
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
I thought he was with you.
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
Really? I've heard better.
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
How could you lose him?
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
I don't know. The left one.
I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
Yes.
So?
Oh no.
What?
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
Me?!
I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
You're right.
Tell him it's for you.
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
Ahh, third base.
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
We had a characturist!
Oh!!
Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
Oh...
Yeah!
Hey, what's going on?
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
No! No-no-no...
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Yeah!
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh, please.
What? Honey.
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
I know.
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
Duh!! Christmas!
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
Just, just, just pick one!
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Got me.
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Oh dear God.
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Do you want me to check again?
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
What do you mean?
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
All right.
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Serious?
Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car.
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
What do you need from the car?
Surprise me.
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
Oh.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
A little.
Yeah?
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Monica! Stop it!
Damn! It's empty!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
What are you doing?
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
With ah, extra anchovies.
That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
You can have the last piece, if you want.
Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Hi Rachel.
Oh hi!
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Wh-wh-why?!
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
It's coming from Joey!
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Well, there's you.
Better not be doin' these in order.
Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
All right, straight, and not subtle.
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
Sorry.
What happened?
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Well...
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Ohh, I don't think so.
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Where the hell have you been?!
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Ugh!
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Your messages have been erased.
Noooooooo!
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday.
Okay.
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
A big idiot.
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Let it be me! Let it be me!
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Come on baby, come on!
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
She does want to.
Yeah!
Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Yeah.
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Come on, they're gonna love you.
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
Rach!
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Yeah! Why?
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
Ohh, nice choice.
Yeah.
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
What?! Why?!
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
So ah, Monica ready yet?
Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
I know.
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Bye, Chandler.
So ah, what's wrong with him?
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Oh my God.
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
I will have one.
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
What?
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
Ohh, what's wrong?!
Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Thank you.
And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds.
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
So we're a little late.
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
Hey! I got great news!
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Relieved?
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Hi.
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
I can do that!
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Ohh, thank you.
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
Go, go, go!
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
All right. I'm a total pro!
Hello?
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
I'd wait.
You'd wait?
Really?
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
And it works both ways.
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
That's easy, baggage claim.
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Let go!
Yes! Did you see that?
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Ohh we're not sailing.
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Which proves that I never lie.
I guess you don't.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
Yes.
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
What are you talking about?
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
Yeah.
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Oh my God. What happened?
I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
What?
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Well, you-you know what I meant.
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Oh man.
Okay. Well there's one down.
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
A pharmacist.
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
And you didn't marry him because...?
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Yeah right.
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
Well, thanks anyway.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
Yeah?
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
Really?!
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
Did you find the dress?
I-We gotta get Monica.
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
Yeah but Phoebe...
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
Oh, thank you so much! Okay.
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
No, I haven't seen him.
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
Yeah, why?
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
So how's it goin' with Joey?
Uh, okay.
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
No you didn't.
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
A lot.
Mm.
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
Rachel! That was a library card!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
It's an expression.
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
What is the matter with you?!
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
What's hard to believe?
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
That's great! Hey! Excellent!
Oh, God bless us, everyone.
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
No.
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
Well what is it? Let me see.
Hey, someone order a coat?
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Huh. Yeah?
I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
Great.
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Sure! It flushes it.
Hello!
Hey! Ah!!
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
No, I haven't.
Who is it?
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Yeah! Right!
You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
Oh, that is so...
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
So?
You really serve people sneezers?
Well um, I don't.
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Me! On my computer.
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Yeah.
Not to me.
Yeah, fair enough.
You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
JOEY!!!!!!
He asked you out?!
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
I want to keep one.
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
That doesn't seem fair.
Yeah, it is the best.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Yeah?
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
See?
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
What?
Yeah, I filled them out last night?
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Oh yes, there you are.
Goodbye Geller.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
I'm thinkin' no.
What did you say?!
No, not my touchie.
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Oh! You are?
Um-hmm.
Yes!
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Wow!
Takes it out of you?
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Just, just, just pick one!
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
But I...
I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
Yeah, he likes porn.
Where ya going?
Hey.
Hey!
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
I thought it was $98.50.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Huh. A moo-point?
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
That is the Coast Guard.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
All right.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
You were supposed to tell her!
Fine, I'll go call her.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so...
Like a date type person?
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
But you said one.
I meant, me plus one!
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
He is the man in the black dress.
I'm Amanda.
Oh I get it! A...man...duh!
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Oh that's not true.
London is stupid! Stupid!
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Yep.
This one's from me.
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go out this window. I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
Okay!
Ross!
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
Thank you. I'm from New York.
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
I'm free! I'm free!
That oughta do it.
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
Thanks!
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
I don't want to move again!
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
Let us keep the apartment and...
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Oh, I couldn't eat now.
Chicken? Chicken boy!
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Some of them.
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Okay, who wore those?
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
No.
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
I guess so.
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Care for a cherry?
Oh, no thanks.
You okay? You all right?
So we should probably get going soon.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Dennis.
Ok, that's me.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Joey.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Okay!
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Good for you.
This hummus is great.
God bless the chickpea.
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
Hummus. I got the hummus.
That won't go with this dress though.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
I know!
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
Okay!
Sucker!
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Hey!!
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Oh, you're kidding.
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Okay!
Already?!
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Which one was Pete Carney?
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Not that often!
No! I'm so happy for them!
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
Okay.
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Aren't you with that girl over there?
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Well when can we have this shower?
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Yesterday!
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
Okay then.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Phoebe!
Yeah?
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
And you know what? We want a rematch.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
...Yeah.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
You al-you already had it?
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
We ruined everything.
Ugh...
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Honey, there's a reason.
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
Or incredibly offensive.
Oh yeah, sure, that too.
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
Oh no.
A dollar?
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Okay.
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
No.
Mmmmm.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Gimme a 'Y!'
Y!
Are you all right?
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
Oh my God!
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
OK. Oh, oh, oh.
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
We're good?
Yeah.
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
Are you sure this time?
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Why did they get divorced?
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
Kinda.
Then change it back!
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
What?
What?
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
Surprise me.
Okay.
Just relax. Just relax Paul, you're doing great. She likes you. She... Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y'know why? Because you're a neat guy. You are the man. You are the man! I still got it. Nice and sexy. You're just a love machine. I'm just a love machine and I won't work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! Showtime. I'm just a love machine, yeah ba-by!
Phoebe!
Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Done.
Great! Thanks, Rach!
Sure! God, please take those off!
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Lots of responses.
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Come on, Rach.
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
I'm good.
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Well, you're not.
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
But if...
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
So the going for help went well?
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
Shut up!
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Sure. I'll help you.
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Ohh.
Okay. Let's use this brush.
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
Then uh, what's-what's this?
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
What are you talking about?
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
No-no, they're not very nice people.
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
What?
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
I'll have whatever Christine is having.
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
What?
Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
I can't believe this!
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Behind you?
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
So... We go eat.
Yes.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
Well relax, he'll be here.
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Thank you. I...yeah.
I mean after tomorrow night.
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Ross thanks.
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
What about him?
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
Y'know what...
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
You got it.
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Wow, you worked in a mine?
All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Nope.
Okay.
Okay.
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Luck!
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
What are you doing here?
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
Oh!
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Alright, what have we learned so far?
SURPRISE!!!
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Yep!
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Oh God, no.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
You don't have the guts.
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Joey we know you steal our food.
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Marcel, I'm hungry.
That was good.
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
Lots of responses.
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
: We have apple cinnamon...
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Wow! What did he say?
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
Rach?
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
It's me! Good morning!
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Was she good?
Don't answer that.
She was...
Awful! Horrible!
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Huh.
I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
No, no, we won't.
We won't?
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Ehh!!
Hey!
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
Move!
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Uh-huh.
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
I got the job!
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
Well...
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
They're not listening too me?
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
I know, it's sick.
Why is it sick?
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Oh God.
Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
It was fine.
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
That's excellent.
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
How ya feelin'?
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
Dude that is so sad.
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Ross, where did you get this?!
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Oh yes.
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
You know, I think I was sixteen.
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
For what?
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Why, why not?
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
Oh, I already have one.
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
Oh, the guys are here.
Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
Hi.
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
Rachel? Um, hi.
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey!
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Ooh! So close.
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Eew! It's creepy looking!
No, I hate cats.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
These are her earrings.
Why not?
Because I lose her stuff!
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
That's closer.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
You wanna go down to the office right now?
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Really, y'think so? I don't..
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Are you alright?
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
No.
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
Also Monday.
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
We need more cards.
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
So what job did you get Joe?
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Great!! That's great!
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
Done.
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
Yeah?
What else do they add smell too?
Oh, is there a problem?
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
You owe me a cat.

Wow.
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Yes I would.
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
No, I hate cats.
Wow! What an unusual cat!
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Do we have to tell her?
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
How's your room Rach?
Isn't that mine?
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is...
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
Yeah.
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
Oh, thank God.
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
Sure! Here.
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Yeah.
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
What, that little thing at the prom?
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Oh, yeah.
He could hear me.
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Bon giorno tutti!
Ewww!
Rachel, how did this happen?
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Now?
Oh, I-I don't know.
Monica, what should I do?
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Woah.
Foxy lady.
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
Well I-I think your wrong.
Oh-no.
Fortunately, I won't. And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.
Do something..... Something....
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
Oh, Kim, Hi.
Uhh-huh.
I didn't read it.
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
I did!
I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
Monica did it?
Monica?
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
I don't think so.
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Come on.
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Yes, I realise that.
Summer catalogue!
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
There y'go. Ross?
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
...But a man can change.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
Oh that.
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Yes.
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Hey!
Hey!
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
'Kay.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
Sorry I'm late, what's up?
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Thanks.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
You can live with me.
What?!
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Fascinating.
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Ah!
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
I'm sorry..
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Oh, yeah! Right!
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Uh-huh.
OK.
Oh that's what you want.
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Really? You two?
Yeah! Rach?
Then tell him quickly.
Fine! We went out.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
Ohh.
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
What?!
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
Can we just start throwing things in?
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Rachel stop!
You're so bad!
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
Yeah, so?
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Rach, have you never done this before?
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Huh.
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
What song was that, Pheebs?
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
And who pays for that?
Um... my... father.
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Oh! Ow!
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
I don't even have a 'pl'.
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
Huh?
I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
yeah-yeah-yeah!!
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
No dear. It's not.
Thank you! Good meeting you.
All right. I'm a total pro!
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
Hey!
Hey!
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
Well, what are you going to wear?
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Doing it on this table.
Wow!
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up either...
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
Guess what?
You got a job?
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
What?
What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Oh I...
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh.
Hey, what's up?
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
She asked-asked you out again?
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
I'll help you dial.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
It tastes like feet!
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Mmmmm.
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
It's not random, it's Bob.
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
You asked him too?!
Hm-mmm.
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Hello! Here we go!
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Really?
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Hey!
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Well, what was supposed to happen?
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
Well...
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
I'm not allowed to have soda.
What's a virgin?
Water it is.
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
I've had better.
All right! I found one that fits!
Whose is it?
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Yeah, but that was different. Y'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird.
I don't want you to see me naked!
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
What?
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
What's the matter?
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
No! Coins hate me!
Hey there, you handsome thing.
Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
None for me.
Okay sorry, whew.
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
Yeah.
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
You won't boss me around anymore?
I won't boss you around.
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
I had one glass.
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Oooooh.
Ooooooh.
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
Are you sure?
No!
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
What's the second part of your plan?
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Okay.
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
I know! I know!
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Really?
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
Good morning!
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
But you guys came so close.
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
Hhhhiiiii.
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
I'm sorry man.
No, that means nothin to me.
Uhhhaahh.
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
I can't do that.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.
Okay.
That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so...
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Okay, sure.
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
I have one.
Good! Great! You can go first.
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
Not for you.
All right, what's goin' on?
Fine. All right, fine.
Yeah.
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
Wait. Give him a minute.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
What's Flimby's?
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
I know!
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
I'll be right back.
You and your ice.
Did you really hear a bear?
Go-go!
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
Oh. Yeah?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
Good morning.
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
Fourth gear!!
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
It's a different guy!
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
Ohhh!
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Okay, a thousand.
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-
Yeah!
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Also large?
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Come where?
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
What?
Okay, bye-bye.
Ow! Ross!!
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
Really?!
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Can I see that for second.
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
Ohh, that is soo sad.
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Fine.
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
Oh, okay.
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Yes, we have something we have to get to.
Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
What big thing?
So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
And thank you, for that.
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
What?
Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
Well, but Pheebs.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
You did not go!
Come on.
Step back.
We have a winner!
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
You have Knicks tickets?
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
Yeah.
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
What?
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Then you should have said something before I met her.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
What?
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
And his puppet too.
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
That doesn't seem fair.
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Okay, Chandler!
Okay.
Oh, well thank you in advance.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
I think I'm gonna cry!
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
What?! Over a stupid room!
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
Ohh...
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line.
Hey, you wet my pants!
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
Ugh!
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
Really? From who?
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Are you talking about having sex?
Normal.
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Hi!
Miss? May I help you?
Can I change a hundred?
Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Heh... I was bluffing.
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
I don't know, you might be the first one.
Rach, did you check the machine?
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
All right! You can have the chair.
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Well, not at first.
What is she doing here?
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Fair enough.
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Ohh, ohh.
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
You've had feelings for me?
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Hey-hey-hey Joey!
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Oh, you go out with him.
Oh, really?!
I'll try.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
None.
They didn't fight a lot?
In my day, divorce was not an option.
Hey, look who's up.
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
I'm Rachel Green.
Thank goodness.
Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Oh well, no I...
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Okay.
Okay.
Yesss?
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
Are you serious?!
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Oh, seriously?
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
No.
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
Agghhh.
Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
A what?
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
I would really like that.
That was...so good.
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
What?!
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
Uh-huh, go on.
That's it. That's my whole name.
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
Who?!
In Human Resources!!!!!!
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Do I have my own castle?
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
You did?
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Oh my God! How bad was it?
Come on!
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go.
What?!
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
Yes.
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Huh?
I-I-I-I did?
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Gotcha!!
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
What's ready?
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
Couldn't be more out.
Me too. Rachel.
No, not this time. So... what'd you have?
I'm not telling.
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Huh?
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
No, they're not.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
C'mon Rachel.
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
What?!
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
Monica!
Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?
What?
I was saving you.
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Pete, can I get you something else?
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Yeah!
Okay, yeah!
Umm, hi!
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
Okay. Okay!
1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
Is Joey Tribbiani here?
Umm, no.
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
You talked to her?
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Okay, hold on. Okay.
You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?
Caitlin!
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
You bet.
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
What?!!
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Animal Control.
See? I've even called Animal Control!
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Really?
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Remember when we were in high school together?
Yeah.
Yes, yes!
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
Great! That's great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Okay.
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
Wow.
Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
Yeah.
Oh my!
They're male nurses.
Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
Hello?
Hi.
Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Look, can, can you do something for me?
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Sex in his chair.
What, uh... what were you thinking?
No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
I mean he just started going out with her.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
Alright.
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
Oh.
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
Uh-huh.
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
A what?
Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Let's roll!
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
That is never good.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
She said she'd call me.
Ohh!
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
Sure! Here.
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
You know what?
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
She's just doing her job!
You sick bastards!
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
Hi.
Wha, what?
Ben just said hi.
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
Yeah, well they suck too.
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
Hello.
It's us.
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
Uh-huh, that one!
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
That's insurance fraud.
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
I can't believe you bought this.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
Yeah!!
Na-huh.
So, I love you.
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
How did you know we were here?
Umm...
Obviously.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Something to remember me by!
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
You're on the phone!
Oh my God! How bad was it?
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
Totally. I'm like 90/10.
Yeah me too.
Mira, Mira, el viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop!
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Ewww!
Hola, Joey!
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
You like me?
Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
But...
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Yeah.
Well, those were seals, man.
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Yeah?
Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
Why not?!
Well, that's because of a lot of...
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
Hi!
Hey!
Why don't you ask him out?
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
What is the matter with you?!
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Phoebe, you're on.
Oh, oh, good.
Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
It's not a club.
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
They have that on the napkins at the club.
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Excuse me?
Thank you.
Right.
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
What?
I think it's sexy.
See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
Still no luck.
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
You're alone.
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
I am so on board!
Rachel didn't you just light that?
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
Yeah, but wait...
Good bye!
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
May I help you?
Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
It was only 500 bucks.
500 bucks at a flea market?!
Oh no.
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
Good luck!
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Oh sure. Vince?!
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
I think I need a drink.
Yeah!
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
Okay.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
What? We could do it!
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
These are from Halloween three years ago.
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Really? Well, in that case...
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
Ross, cough drops, please?
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.
I'm done now.

Get the what?
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
I swear you said you had the keys.
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Why would I have the keys?
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
Because a car backfired?
Okay, why are you here?
You talked to her?
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
Yeah. Hmmmm.
It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
Why?
Because, uh-it has to.
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
Oh I am!
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
Stevie the TV?
Is there a problem?
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Don't touch him!
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
What a nice story!
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Yeah I did!
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
Oh great!
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
Because I'm going to London.
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
Yeah, that didn't work.
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Awwww!!
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
I could die.
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Oh.
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
That would be nice.
Pardon?
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Are you drunk?!
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Monica? Monica!
Water rules!
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Zelner.
Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Oh! You are?
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
I would never do that!
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
Mark's a genius!
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
That's the surprise!
Surprise!
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
London is stupid! Stupid!
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
I'll do it!
I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Okay.
Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
Gotcha!!
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Go on.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
That's insurance fraud.
Okay, okay. I hate this.
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Rach, here's your mail.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who's ass I cannot kick.
Oh, of course!
Chuck Woolery?
Say it!
Say we are unagi!
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
Thank you. I'm from New York.
No way!
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
Well, thank you, Melanie.
OK, this one right here is from me.
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
Like this.
Sure! It flushes it.
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
What did you get?
Credit.
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
Yes.
Yeah?
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Thanks!
No, I'm-I'm serious!
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
I did not!
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
That guy, he burns me up.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
Yes, and grumpy.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
I love you too.
Aw, it's soo unfair.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Well, like father, like son.
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
Good for you!!
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
What?
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
So-so there is no party.
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
Exactly.
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
You really didn't know?
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
Like what?
What-what-what is so funny?
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
Okay, see ya.
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
And you're not gonna do that.
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
Hey!
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
Oh, how well you know me...
How'd you pay for them?
Uh, credit card.
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Does anybody need anything?
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
Really?!
Uh-hmm.
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
Hang on.
Hello, excuse me.
No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
Will you quit hoggin' it!
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Oh, how well you know me...
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
Fish!
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
You did?
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
I did.
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Huh.
What?
This totally makes sense!
It does not!
What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
What?
Yeah?
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
Yeah.
So, I'll get-get back to my friend.
Oh, that'd be great.
Okay!
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Yes.
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
You could?
Your own boat?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
To Monica!
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Yeah, you're on your own.
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
I'd love some juice. Thanks.
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Excellent!
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
That is what the thing is.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
What are you doing?
Storming out!
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Yeah.
All right.
Oke-dokey.
Oh-ho!
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Knock-knock.
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
The fear?
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Because, I'm too afraid.
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
No. A break from us.
I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
Umm...
What's up?
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
Hello darlings.
And there's daddy!
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
Oh come on Ross!!
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
Yeah.
Never call me from that phone.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Oh my God!
What?
Yeah?
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Oh.
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
You get your messages!
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
All right!
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
Okay!
Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
I can't do that.
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
Yeah.
Yeah!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Uh-Huh, Which is...?
So?
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
How? How is your fault?
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
Very good Monica! You know where they are.
I sure do! And you don't get one!
They're still in my coat.
Damn!
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
Chandler, is that...
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
She has to know that your not ready.
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
Hey!
Hey!
Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
Nothing.
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
So what are you gonna be?
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
You said number two.
I also said number one.
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
Basketball!
I'm sorry.
Wow! That would be great.
Really?
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Oh my God.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
No. A break from us.
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Tag Jones.
Uh-huh, go on.
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
Go ahead.
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Yes I would.
Yes.
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
Well where's Amanda?
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
Ross, cough drops, please?
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
I can't believe this!
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Well that too. Joey?
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
Floopy?
Yeah.
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
Your sister Joan is crazy.
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
About what?
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Take the top down did ya?
Only way to fly.
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
All right, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Something wrong?
No. Nothing.
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Did you go home and change?
No, I haven't seen him.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
So, uh, how's she doing?
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
It's uh, right through there.
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
Yeah, it sure is!
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Yes it's true.
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Fine by me; hope she wins.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
Okay.
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Well, you're not.
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
I KNEW IT!!!!
Gin.
Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
This is how I would hold a football.
Ok, here, here. There we go.
It's alright, it's no big deal.
Really?
Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
Really?
Okay, let's go running!
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
No, you don't.
What is this? Ross, what is this?
Good luck.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Is this true?
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
But, but?
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
Talk to me.
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
I found it!
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Well you sure used a large font.
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Something else I might have said?
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
You said it was okay!
You said she was bald!!
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I...
Bye!
So, system kinda broke down huh?!
We want you to marry her!
What?!!
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
You have to respect the sea!
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
Phoebe, tell her!
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
No, only for sex.
Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
Uh-huh.
Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Hi honey.
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
What?
Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Yes, we were just...
I'm already here.
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
If it helps, I could slide over.
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Ohhhh.
And, uh, and then I kissed her.
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
Hi!
Rachel.
Nice to meet you.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
I'm good.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Is that a swing?
Oh don't even ask!
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Yes, we are.
Rach...
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
So are things with you and Joey any better?
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
You shouldn't.
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Oh, no!
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
She's not even cold yet!
That's true.
Okay? You ready?
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
What?
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
No, you don't.
All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
Which one do you have?
I don't care.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
Yeah, umm, no honey.
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
What?
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
All right, fine.
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
All right, you got it.
All right.
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
: Loser?
No, I fold.
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Why are you so jealous of me?
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
Wow! I did not see that coming.
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Really?
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
...Pheebs?
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Sharing is good.
Really? Like how?
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
No one was around to hear that?
So what'd he say?
Well, thanks anyway.
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
How long do cats live?
I'm sorry?
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
That's just great.
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Monica? Monica!
Water rules!
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Vanilla?!
Yeah.
To Ross.
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
Really?!
Yes, we are.
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Honey, there's a reason.
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
Yeah?
...is for me not to see you anymore.
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Sure.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
What's the charity?
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
You idiot!!
I'm sure you're right, but why?
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Oh yeah!
Oh that's so sweet thanks.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
Look I was going to tell you!
What?
You're kidding!
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
No, you know what, I think you should go.
What?
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
Oh. We?
Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to...
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
What? You mean behind my back?
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
What do we use to split it?
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Hey!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
I want to go to the bathroom.
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Uh-huh
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
No!!
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Green. To the green.
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Happy birthday!
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.
I know, it is.
Yeah!
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
Are you sure?
Oh me too.
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
Yeah. That's Daddy.
That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
So?
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Hey! I made that for her!
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
I know! I know! I know!
Monica, you asked the question.
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Ohh.
This stuff is great!
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
When's my daddy coming back?
Sharing is good.
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Ow!!
Isn't there a national football league.
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Well, where's the logic in that?!
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
That's right!
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
I want the little round waffles.
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
But...
Okay uh, however...
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
A couple hours.
Oh, that's nice!
Excuse me?!
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Kim, hi.
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
Oh, really?
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
It's not funny, this is actually my job.
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Ah, just one other thing.
Yes?!
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
Honey, I'm sorry.
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
I know. I'm sorry.
So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
I have no idea.
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
He didn't ask me to marry him.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Hey! Hi!
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
I think it's sexy.
Sexy?
No kidding?
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
How could I have left them in the copy room?
Fine.
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
Nope.
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Yeah? Sometimes it's...
Okay, I'm the baby.
Eh! Stop it!
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Aw, Mon...
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Yeah.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
Just a job!
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
Oh, God...
Should I not have told you?
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Prague?
There's sooo much you don't know.
I did! I absolutely did!
You idiot!!
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
I could do that.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
Guess!
Umm, a flea market?
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Ohh, yes.
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Really?
Okay.
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
That is so made up!
Yay!
There you go.
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
I gotta get the before shot!
What?!
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
What if you put them here.
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
What?
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
No no no! Federal regulations!
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Ooh!
Okay!
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about.
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
How come we have one extra place setting?
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department.
Oh, hi!
So glad you brought someone.
Oh, hi.
And I also brought my friend Joey...
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
Ahh, miss? More coffee?
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
My God! What did you order?!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
I'll talk to them!
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
No it isn't, I ate that.
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Hi!
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
It took two people to break up this relationship!!
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
But we have to!
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
It's not here.
How could I have left them in the copy room?
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Come on, hurry!
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Not a good day for birds...
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Emotional Knapsack?
Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
Phoebe!
That is a different phone.
That is damning evidence.
Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
You are totally jealous.
Honey, I love you too.
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
D'oh!! I've got it!
You don't have it.
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
No.
Phoebe!
That is a different phone.
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Look, I'm sorry.
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Oh, right!
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
You need to get out of my chambers.
Yeah!
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
I was just leaving.
Why? Did you write it?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Maybe not.
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
To Ross.
Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Well...
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Hm-mmm.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...
No I didn't!
Are you sure?
Feminine.
Yes!
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Wow! This place is fabulous!
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
I'm sorry honey.
Yeah.
Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
I said, "Like what?"
Now that's a thinker.
Hi!
Care for a cherry?
Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
The coins have finally forgiven me!
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
Oh my God, you look so good!
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
Because I promised Mindy I would.
Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.
No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
But hes falling in love with her.
Okay... Okay.
Oh, okay, oh.
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Umm-hmm.
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Coffee house?
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Oh. Aw, forget it.
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
That's very nice.
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
Insane!
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
That was not funny!
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
She is a kook.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
Oh, great. This is just...
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Maybe not.
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Oh that's great! You are the best!
I thought you didn't smoke.
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Great!
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
You're welcome.
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
There you go!
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
No no no! Federal regulations!
Alright. What's the message?
Uh... I don't know.
When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Yeah.
Oh, I'd say about a month.
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Ugh!
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Nice.
And the way she slaps all the time!
Oh!
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
So I nodded off a little.
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
Well then I demand a recount!
Actually, it wasn't that close.
The coins have finally forgiven me!
Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
All you had to do was buy the card!
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Why not?
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Naked alone time.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
No-no-no-no. Hey!
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
I'm gonna do it too!
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Yeah, um, may we help you?
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Which one was Pete Carney?
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
What? C'mon, talk to me.
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Technically, huh, no.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Yeah.
Sit down!
No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
Okay.
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
It's this way? Sorry.
Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
I own this store.
So, does this come in another color or...
So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
All right, I like that.
Okay.
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
I cannot push it in!
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
It's all right. Sweetheart.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
You guys! You guys!
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
Ooh, who's it for?
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
We are so gonna find them this year.
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
God I'm just a horrible person.
Wh-why?
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
Uh-oh...
How-how did that happen?
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
What?
Hi.
Really.
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
No, I had sex in high school.
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
Hi.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
Oh yes! Thank you!
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
Do you?
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
I'm still right here!
What?!
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
You work and you work and you work on a boat...
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
Hey.
No way.
I'm not answering that.
I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
Okay.
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
Steve... sleeve!
OK, noone is named Sleeve.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
What?
He can have his job back.
That's great. Thanks Rach.
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Ah, the other Jack.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
Hey!
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Paolo. Hi.
Ross!
I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Huh.
That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Well, there you go!
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
Well that wasn't easy.
Ok, dinner's on.
Alright you kids, bye now.
Bye.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Oh my God.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
Are they here yet?
Ok.
Ok?
Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Um, what- what would make you think that?
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
What? What's what you were afraid of?
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Hey Chandler!
Hey!
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
No, wait Phoebe.
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
But you're not anymore!
No, I'm not.
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Sure...
I don't know... um, Grease?
No....
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
Here you go.
Thanks
What check thing?
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
Your parents'?
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
What's going on?
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
Hey!
Did you find it?
Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Okay, calm down, here they are.
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Le Poo's still alive?!
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
It's Le Poo.
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Yeah, you wish!
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Yeah.
Really?
Aww...
Big day.
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
You have to pick your moments.
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
How 'bout just a boom?
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Hi!
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
It was a dry day.
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Hey!
Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Hi, Joey.
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Yeah!
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Step back.
We have a winner!
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
Hey!
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
I don't know if it's true.
Oh b-b-but it is!
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
How often do you read it?
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
Because, I'm too afraid.
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Rachel?
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Are you kidding?
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
What's up?!
Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
What?!
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
You're not gonna mess it up.
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Hey!
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
You mean like for award shows?
Some of them.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Okay, can we please go eat?
No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Hey!
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Hey.
May I come in?
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
And you were at this job for four years?
That's right.
What?
I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'
Hi!
Nice uh, costume.
E!
Gimme an 'M!'
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
Oooh.
We're all alone in an empty apartment.
There it is.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
That's weird, she locked the door.
Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Yeah!
Hi! How are you?
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
Good luck Phoebs.
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
Well, I just called Joshua...
Oh, how did it go?
What did he say?
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
So you really OK about all this?
Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Oh!
What was that?
When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
Not interested.
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
You are right there with Emily. And it's y'know, it's kinda like.... it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Uh-huh.
I gotta get to work.
Oh yeah? Fine.
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
No. Thank you.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
I can't believe you would say that!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
I don't know.
Is he romantic with her?
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Well, what about my stuff?
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Oh, why?
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Okay.
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
I have quarters!
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
I know.
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
Y'know what?
No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
Oh, I thought I heard you.
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Well, somebody should.
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Nope! That never happened to me!
Nope.
All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
How are ya?
Good.
Yeah.
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
And Monica knows...
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
Rachel has a new doll.
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
Oh god.
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Hi.
I can't believe you came back.
Rachel! Rachel!
What?
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...
I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
Yeah!!
Pepper?
None for me.
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
I can't do this.
Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
OK, this one right here is from me.
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
: That book got me through some tough times.
I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
Still in love with?!
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
I was kidding.
So was I.
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
Hm-mmm.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Oh!
Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Okay.
Yesss?
Yeah.
O-kay!
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
What?
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
Really?
Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
I have my reasons.
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Wow... Wow!
Yeah.
Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
Yeah?! So's yours!
How did work go?
You stink!
Thanks!
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
You want me to see a therapist?
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
Well, this is much better.
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
And who laminated it?
That would be me.
Hey, it's my list.
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Pffhah.
What's your problem?
Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
Hey! Hi!
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Okay great!
Yeah!
What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Yeah!
After one class? I don't think so.
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
Together.
Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
Hopefully.
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
Yes!!!
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Eh?
You're alone.
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Wh-what?!
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Yeah.
Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
Yeah, what's your point?
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
C'mon, she's your mom!
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
It's my sister.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
So how are things going with Paul?
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
You're not dying Hope, you're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.
Oh Drake.
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
What???
Oh my god.
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Yeah!
I can't believe it!
Hey.
Hey! Good, you're home!
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
She's not even cold yet!
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Wow!
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Okay.
And a glass of tepid water.
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
Oh-hooo, I missed you.
I missed you too.
I suppose.
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
In your mouth?!
You were at the coffeehouse!
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Hey, where you been?
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
Let me get my coat.
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
What? Nothing.
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
Joey's!
Okay...
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
It-it did!
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
If you want, I'll do it.
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Hi.
Hey!
Well, it's nice to know that you...
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
What's this.
Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
Oh, hi.
Hey, what's going on?
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
Hi!
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Can I ask what-Come on in.
Okay.
And y'know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8:30.
So, I love you.
I love you.
Okay.
Bye.
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
Man, do you know what guys want!
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
You put these on my desk!
I did not!
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
I am so hot for you right now.
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Joey!
Oh, you weren't finished?
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
It's the same story.
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Oh, Chantal!
Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Really?!
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
Excuse me. Hi.
Hi.
You don't think I'm cute?
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
You completely stole my answer!
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
What?!
I just, I feel, I-I just...
And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
Thanks.
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
Oh, that's funny!
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Ross thanks.
You want me to call her right now?
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Yeah do it now, call right now.
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
So, what? That's it?
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
I just, I thought Joey was there.
What do you mean?
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
What is it?
Barry who you almost...?
Barry who I almost.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
Yeah!!
Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Yeah!
Hey, and then lunch.
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
What?! No! Why?!
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
Isn't it.
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Hey you guys.
"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
Hey! I call her!
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Still broken?
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Oh, Ross...
What?
Huh.
Oh Ross, you're so great!
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Oh, why?
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure
So, what should you have done?
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
Then uh, what's-what's this?
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, what' going on?
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
Francette? What is she? A couch?
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
That's weird.
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
I'm a little embarrassed.
Then why did she ask us to...
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something...
Monica, please?
He's totally flirting with you too.
Hey!
Hey! Hi Bonnie!
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Yeah?
Who the hell are all these people?
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
It's fine.
Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
Oh wow.
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Well, because of us! Because of our history.
I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
How can you not remember us kissing?!
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
Because I promised Mindy I would.
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
I may have.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
What the hell are you doing?!
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
Nothing! You go!
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
What is that noise?
You!
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
What do you mean?
You mean a backup?
Exactly!
Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
That's not true?
No.
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
Oh, that is so...
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Let me see! Show them!
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
First of all, I'm not losing...
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Because it's my apartment!
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
No! Why?
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Ross, I...
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
Yeah!
It's got 'em!
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
Okay, fine.
You don't know!
YOU KNOW!!!!
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Rachel, get the book! The book!
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Oh no!
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
Mon.
What, what.
And that's, that's funny why?
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
When?
Oh you are so lucky.
I know.
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
Would you excuse me for a second?
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
And I just want a million dollars!
Rachel?!
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Hi, sure!
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Who's that?
Pierce Brosnan?
Uh-huh.
Okay! "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time!
Really? Really?!
Yes!
Hey!
Hey!
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
Me too, we should get goin'.
Rachel, that's all we do.
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
What's the other one?
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Oh, we have some...
No you don't!
I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Hey!
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
Oh, no, no.
What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Still no smile?
Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
Do you?
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
It's the same story.
Wow, it's really long.
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
Yeah!
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
'Scuse me?
Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Oh, I'm sure.
Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Yes, at 4:00.
I'd better get back to my desk.
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Like what?
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Oh no, yeah.
Where are you gettin' this?
Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Well, go ahead Rachel.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
That's who.
Look, are you gonna be ok?
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
What?
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Oh yeah!
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
What are you saying?
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
I'll treat you real nice.
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Shhhh!!!
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
I swear you said you had the keys.
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Yeah! No?
A kiss? What are you talking about?
Come on, Rach.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Oh! No, not really.
Well, that's cool. So did...
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
Oh b-b-but it is!
Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Okay.
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Ennnh.
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Huh?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Joey has got a secret peephole!
Oh no! No! No! No!
Look!
Dude! That's my sister!
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Hey!
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Rach, have you never done this before?
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Just go over and say hi.
Hey, Danny!
Hey! What's going on?
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Why did you do that?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
I don't want to, I'm scared.
Hey, you guys!
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Brides magazines?
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Yes, they can stay with us.
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
Wooooo!!!!
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Come on, take 'em off!!
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
You could drink the fat.
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
What?
I think you should drink the fat.
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
Depends on what you mean by we.
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Oh yeah, go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
You're over me?
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Don't do that.
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Call me!
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
So what was it for anyway?
I wanna say a disease.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Well look, if you don't like this...
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Francette? What is she? A couch?
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Ugh!
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Ha!
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
We know!
Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you?
Spiderman?
Hardy Boy.
Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
FINE BY ME!!
Hey!!
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
It looks like a women's purse.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Exactly! Unisex!
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
The guy with the gas?!
Really?!
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Yeah... ....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
Sorry, Rach.
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Yes, we do.
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
And that's, that's funny why?
I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
OK.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Knock-knock.
Until now.
Oh, hi.
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
Now I do.
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Yes.
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
What's up with Gene?
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Oh my God!
Oh, no!
Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Duh, where've you been?
Yes!
Why?
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Sounds like a fun party.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Something else I might have said?
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
That's good. Very good!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
Yeah, I remember.
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Hey.
Hey.
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
What if you put them here.
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
That's, that's nice twice!
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
Technically, huh, no.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Hey.
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air...
Still thinking about it huh?
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
You're hurt!
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
I would never do that!
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
In my day, divorce was not an option.
Hey, look who's up.
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Like a goalie, right?
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
I suppose.
Umm-hmm.
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
OK, gook luck.
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Yeah, that didn't work.
I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Do I?
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
Hey!
Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Um-hmm.
What am I making him by the way?
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
Hey.
Hey.
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
That's not Ross!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
This stuff is great!
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
You do? Why?
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
What are you writing?
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
Hi guys!
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
Oh.
Are you jealous?
You are totally jealous.
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
How did you get in here?
Your sister Joan is crazy.
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
No Joe, no miracle.
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
I think I should get the chair!
How do you figure?
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
I know, yeah, sorry.
What, it's not your fault.
Really?
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
Does it?
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
Are you sure?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
You think?
Hey, you're right.
Yeah.
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
Oh, is there a problem?
Oh my God! That was flirting?!
Yeah.
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
Hi.
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Any luck?
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
Hey!
I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
I'm talkin'!
Alright, fine. I'll call you back.
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Okay. I'll miss you.
Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.
Bye Ben.
Bye.
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Oh my God!!
What do you think?
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
Rachel? Do you smoke?
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
That doesn't seem fair.
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
And I just want a million dollars!
Rachel?!
Can I get you some coffee?
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
Here are your cakes.
We didn't order cake.
You're right.
You know.
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
So that's two of my wives.
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Yeah.
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
I don't know.
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
Is Monica here?
No.
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Hey, is Chandler here?
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Twenty-four actually.
Me too.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
That is neither here nor there.
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
Okay, okay, okay.
I think you should go.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
Dude!
Sorry.
Well it didn't!
What?!
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
That's kinda sad.
Got it!
Let's roll!
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
....Are we still talking about sex?
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
What?
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
Marenge,
Everybody!
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
I'm just going to need to see your passport.

Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
Ooh.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
What?
Could tonight be the Night?
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Okay.
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Oh! I used to do that too!
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
What?
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
Why do you care so much anyway?
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Uh-huh, that one!
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
What? What?
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
I did!
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
Yeah?
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Nope.
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
Hi. I'm back.
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
A lover?
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Were both of those Joey?
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
We didn't give you any money!
You don't think I know that!
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
Yeah?
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Yeah.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
Hi.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
I can't believe she cracked your code!
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Eh. Beth dies.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
You owe me a waffle.
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
Hello, Chip.
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
So ah, Monica ready yet?
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
It's uh...
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
It does sound appealing.
Oh, I never could do it.
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
What?
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
To get you to make out with him!!!
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
And lucky means, more cleavage?
Does for me.
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
What?
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
That's ridiculous!
Can I use.. either thumb?
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Good for me!
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah?
The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
What?
Why?
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
What?
You're nose is bleeding!
Umm...
Sorry. Sorry.
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
OK, that's my tattoo.
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Um. yeah.
I am soo dead.
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
All right, you ready?
You can, I know you can!
I don't think so.
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
That's a little clearer.
Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
My what?
Are you serious?
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Yeah, don't push it though.
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
Did I, did I even treat?
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
What's happening to your accent?
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
Well, hello Rachel!
Have you really done this before?
Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you...
Hi!
Hi!
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
Ah!
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
No! They did!
Yeah, we went shopping!
Sorry Jill.
Sorry-sorry Jill.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Yeah, you do.
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
I'm sorry?
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
An advance?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Let it be me! Let it be me!
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
We're gonna find love!
Definitely!
What do you mean?
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Time's up, now your dead.
And deaf!
Yes.
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
I wish I had smoked for my career...
That's so gross!
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Okay!
Oh that's so great!
I know!
Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Ohh yeah.
Right?
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Oh! Thank you!
So now what's going on here?
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
Uh, wh-why?
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
OK, gook luck.
Wha, uhh, what?
OK, now I'm nervous.
Maybe you should put it off.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
What?
You're bleeding.
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
What?
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
Pretty good! I told her.
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
What's a 'niffle'?
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
: Loser?
No, I fold.
I'm in.
How many you want?
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Oh, get out of here!
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
How-how did you lose your job here?
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
What's wrong with people having sex?
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
What?!
What?!
So that's two of my wives.
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
Yeah.
Wow!
The guy with the gas?!
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
But, it's not raining.
I can't catch a break!
Yeah?
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
Oh yeah surfer?
I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Hey.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Hey Rach.
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
Sure.
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
What?
She-she died Jill.
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
It's us.
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
Hi.
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
I need some milk.
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
Crap!!
I gotta go!
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
Any luck?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Hmm.
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
So you hit her in the face?
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
What happened?
You kissed him?!
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Oh my God.
Can I see your license please?
Your license?
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
Right!
So tell me about this girl?
Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.
Ehh, pardon me?
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Sure! Why?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
What did Joey say? I like you back?
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Yeah, what's it about?
Events from around the globe.
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized...
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
What about Julie?
Well, that could take a while.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
What are you talking...
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Yep! That's hilarious!
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Not even with your best friend.
Noo!
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
Pretty much.
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Hey!
Hey Rach!
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, right, clink.
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
I mean he just started going out with her.
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Oh fresh air!
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
Okay.
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
Yeah.
Yeah, what's that like?
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Hey! What's up?!
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
What's up?!
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
Hello!
All right, I'll do it.
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
...But a man can change.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Huh?
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Tah-daaah!
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Well, whaddya think?
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
Morning!
Yeah!!
Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Call her! Call her now!
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Oh here's a whole bunch.
Oh my God!
What?
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
So how's Mindy?
Brrrrrrr!
Hell is filled with people like you.
So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
Sure.
So.
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Really? Me?
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
What d'you think?
Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
That's me.
Ahh, yes.
You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
Okay. Okay.
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Paul.
Oh.
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Why did they get divorced?
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Which time?
I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
What?
No dear. It's not.
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
I wrote you a letter.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
No.
Rachel, you and Mark?!
Morning!
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
Yeah, I know.
What?
Rachel stop!
You're so bad!
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Wow, cute one!
Very!
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
Damnit!
Okay, who's next?
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
What?
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
What?
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Y'know what? You are right?!
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
So you really OK about all this?
Hi guys.
Hey.
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Sure!
Hey. It happened!
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Why are you taking this away from me?
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
She didn't hang up either...
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
Rach, I got a message from you.
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
That is lucky.
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
Y'know what you should do?
Huh?
I'm listening.
See?
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
200 at least.
...and this guy...
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Ross, there is no us, OK.
No, but. . .
Well, but, but. . .
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Here, look, alright, does this help?
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!

I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
Thank you.
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Really?
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
That's ok.
What's goin' on?
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
No. No-no-no-no.
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Still crying?
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
What's the other one?
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Uh, here. What time?
4 o'clock. Food?
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
Hey!
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
Okay.
Okay.
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
That is so made up!
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Are you all right?
I think you're done.
Okay, time to take off the bra.
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Oh me too.
No, I do not hear that.
...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
You don't think I'm cute?
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
You seem to really like her.
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
You think?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
Everybody!
Okay, I'll do it.
You'll do what?
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
What's this?
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Hey Rachel!
Hi!
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Just a job!
Yes.
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Well neither do I!
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
Hi.
How'd did it go?
I'm so proud of you.
Me too!
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
I am so sorry.
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
Just a smidge.
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Sorry, Rach.
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Oh!
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
Oh, I couldn't eat now.
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
What about him?
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
It's not a cat!
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Uhh, the ball thing.
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
No.
You want me to talk you out of it?
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
What?!
Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you're a real special lady, but my divorce isn't final yet and, and, and we've been on four days, so I'm thinking "No, but thanks."
YOU IDIOT!!!!!
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
Phoebe?
Hm?
Fish!
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Oh, hello Rachel.
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Really!?
Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up?
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Hey Rachel!
Umm, is Tag here?
No. Why?
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Oh I am!
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
Yeah! You're the best!
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Your sunglasses?!
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Yes.
It's that terrible?
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
I love you too.
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
What?! We can't do that!
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
We're not?!
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
Hey, Monica!
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
I don't know sweetie.
No! Help me!
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
You have some life here, sweetie.
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
For...me.
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
Okay Rach, but...
Op! You're peeping!
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
No, I'm not.
'Cause you guys were on a break.
When's my daddy coming back?
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
I didn't realize that she was so close.
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Hi Rachel!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Uh, boat rope.
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
You got a tattoo?
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
You start working on that list.
I cannot believe her.
I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
You know what?
What?
But...
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Hey Rach!
How'd it go?
Not a good day for birds...
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
I don't gossip!
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
What? They were like this!
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
I'm gonna start getting ready!
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
You said she was bald!!
What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
Yes.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I know honey, I'm sorry.
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
...it's gonna be okay!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
Thanks!
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
That word was swans.
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
I thought it went very well.
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
There's nobody here!
That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
All right, I'll pick that one.
Ohhh!
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
What?
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
I'm right here!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
I'm still right here!
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
I mean really, think about it.
Ho-ho, I will.
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
What's hard to believe?
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
But I...
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
Hi Ralph.
Hi Kim.
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
Really?
Women really want this?
More than jewelry.
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
You got porn!
Hello.
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Oh, everything's pink.
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Oh my god.
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
I think so.
Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
Yeah. A year ago..
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
I don't think mine likes me either.
Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
That is damning evidence.
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
Really?
Will you call him?
So now, what is this now?
Guggly worm.
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
I can scratch that right off.
All right!
All right? Thank you.
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Mm-mmm.
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
What?! What?!
Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
Yeah, maybe.
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Oh, that poor bastard.
You're not gonna be phased out!
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Remembered what?
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
I thought you didn't smoke.
We get high.
Oh, me too.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
So what happened?
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Ohh! That would be great.
Yeah, I didn't think of that.
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Remembered what?
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
OK.
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
Just one cheek.
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Nooo!
She has to know that your not ready.
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
Uh-huh.
Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
Ohh, God.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Very good, so good.
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Come on! Look where you are!!
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
Hey guys.
Hey Danny.
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Yeah?
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Do you have any ice?
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Yeah, okay.
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Ross, you don't know that.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Really? Like how?
That's a good one.
Yeah? You like that one?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
It's not here.
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
What???
Oh my god.
I am proud of all my friends today.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
Sit down!
Okay.
We're sorry.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
What are you guys talking about?
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
But I love swing music!
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
Rachel has a new doll.
Uh, hello!
Hi-e!!
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
Wow, you worked in a mine?
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Oh, this is not that bad.
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Why? What happened to him?
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
You're not gonna be phased out!
Ehh!!
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
We need more cards.
That must be our alcohol and beers!
Hey!
Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
I, I don't know.
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Phoebe!
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
That's fine!
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
Wh-why is that the best part?
Because then I don't have to!
I'm really not deciding!
Fine!
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
My God! You love me!
What?
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
Hi.
Are you all right?
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
God I know, you're right.
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
Are you talking about having sex?
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
And you're not gonna do that.
So-so there is no party.
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Thank you.
Um, coffee to go, please.
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Okay!
Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
You have to respect the sea!
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Ugh!
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
Ohh! Hi!
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Hey!
Y'know?
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
Fruitflies?
Yes! Thank you.
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Hey!
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
It's not random, it's Bob.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife!
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
Him? Him, Ross?
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Absolutely, yeah!
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Well, I taught me and I love me.
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
I don't gossip!
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Ball? There is no ball.
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
Hey, hey, hey no.
Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.
Are you crazy?
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
What?
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Normal.
Nope! That never happened to me!
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
Did uh, Ross call?
No, I'm sorry.
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
What was the book?
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
What?!
I know, Monica told me.
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
Surprise!!
What?
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
I have plans.
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Yesterday!
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Rachel, calm down!
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
Hopefully.
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
How long do cats live?
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
And stop saying that! I hate that!
Okay!
The pizza-place across the street any good?
What?!
Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
That's a little clearer.
Sure, I-I-I...
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
An advance?
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy.
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Yes!
You tired Chandler?
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
It's my sister.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
This one?
It worked!
Wait, no, look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..." Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
Hey!
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
I am gonna see her again.
Damnit Phoebe!!
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
What?!
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
She asked-asked you out again?
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
Thank you. I...yeah.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
Not right now.
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Yeah.
Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
I'm talking about massages.
Oh.
Okay that's fair.
All right.
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
Well, hey I did learn.
Really?
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Well, Ross said my name.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
But my clothes are-ohh!
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
That's right!
Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
Rachel is my girlfriend.
So, this was uh, really fun.
Need uh, need a little hand there.
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
Yeah.
Ok fine.
Thank you.
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
What are you talking about?
Yeah, what' going on?
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
Awwww!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
Huh.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
All right. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Okay, good. Thank you. I'll be back shortly, all right?
Hey!
Hey!
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
What?!
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
That's great! That's wonderful!
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
Yes!
That, you get? That, you get?
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
So you hit her in the face?
Aww, Pheebs.
Honey, that's you're name.
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
C'mon Rachel.
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Huh?
Hey.
Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
Okay Ross! Please don't die!
That's kinda sad.
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
ON A CAT??!!!!
It's not a cat!
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
It's not a cat!
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Waitressing?
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
W-What was the one right before bananas?
Y-sure!
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
Then how come it is?
Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
I'll say.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
Hi!
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
What? Why?!
This is weird for me!
How is that important?
Oh it's important!
Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Wow.
Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!
What?
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Because! Because I was sad.
What do you mean?
I don't care, she slept with me.
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Okay.
What?
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
I'll treat you real nice.
Won't-won't that take longer?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
And your fly's still open...
Ha, I made you look....
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
I'll go.
Fine.
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
Do you want me to quit?
What?! What would make you think that?
Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
What?
Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Hi!
Wow!
I know!
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
I guess so.
Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
Exactly.
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
No!
So what happened?
What happened?
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
What do you mean?
I can do that!
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Good.
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Why not?
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
I don't think so.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
Emily.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
You look cute in bubbles.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
Absolutely!
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Ooh, this always happens.
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
Okay.
Okay.
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Yeah.
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
Right...
So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
What big thing?
I'll go.
Yay!
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
No, look, don't touch that!
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
Oh! Yeah!
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message.
Aaaahhhhhhh.
I'm outa here.
Well, what happened?
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
No, not my touchie.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater." Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Nobody likes change.
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
You seem to really like her.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
Yeah, it is the best.
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Yeah, I can do that.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Thanks.
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Never done that before.
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Okay.
Um, I'm not.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
See, now it's weird again.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Hello? Hello?
So how's Mindy?
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
What?
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Why not?
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Why are you laughing?
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Oh, really?
You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Hi Kim.
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
I'm starving!
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Hello.
And that's Pete's Mom.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Oy.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
W-What was the one right before bananas?
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand.
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
I'll take care of it.
That's right! You do what the hand says!
Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
No.
Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
You would think.
What?!
Gunther, I quit.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
OK, tip the man.
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Oh! That's nice.
Wow. Good speech.
Yeah, it really was!
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
Really?
Uh-huh.
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
Go!
Oh! That's nice.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
Oooooh...
I don't think so dear.
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
No way! It's mine!!
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
See, he's her lobster.
Nooooo. You're really not going?
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Oh.
In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
Hi!
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
Sorry, prom queen.
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Nope.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
So what happened?
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
Well, how bout just her mom?
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Oh that's not true.
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
Oh that's so sweet thanks.
Ohh.
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
Excuse me?
Here let me...
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
Then why did she ask us to...
Yes, Papaya Extract.
Thank you!
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
Great!
Okay, London 1...
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Right! But, I am sorry.
She took all my stuff.
Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Of course, yeah!
Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
Yeah?
So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
Yeah, don't push it though.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
I say push her down the stairs.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
You're gonna be an aunt.
Oh shut up!
Hi guys!
Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
Hello.
Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
Maybe in L.A?
Yes!
Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
Ooh, steer clear of you.
That's right.
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Shut up!
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Yeah? You like that one?
Yeah, you're funny.
Can I do it to you?
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
I'm not in love with Ross!
Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
We thought you knew!
We?!
Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
Oh there is no way.
Okay then.
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
That'll be $3.85.
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
No, Rach!
And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
Marenge,
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
Oh, please!
Hey, how you doin'?
I've never done that.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
And then... your face is bloated?
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
I, I know.
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
How could you lose him?
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
Sure.
Hi.
Hi, hi can I help you?
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Hi.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Fair enough.
Zelner.
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
