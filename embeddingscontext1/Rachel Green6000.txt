Ohh whoops.
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
Phoebe's Mike?
Oh, it's fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over.
Since when?
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Is Monica here?
Hey!
Where you goin'?
Hi.
I thought it was Ross.
So hum...Why did I have to hide?
Oh, right, clink.
Um, cheers.
Ok, good night!
Night.
Bring it on!
I do yoga.
What? I-I don't.
Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
That sounds great.
So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Yeah, that didn't work.
But what about all the "finding-his-flaws" stuff we've been doing?
I won't speed.
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
I cannot believe her.
You start working on that list.
Just a bug.
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Joey, I really don't...
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
Goo--ood night!
Yeah! Good night!
Wonderful weird.
Good weird?
Hi! Excuse us.
James Campbell...
Well, you should have.
But I didn't.
What? Yes, I am!
You're not sick!
I, I don't have it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
That's not European!
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
She could be you.
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Both of you?
Uh huh.
Are you over me?
Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
That would be great!
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
Aw, Mon...
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Hello, Chip.
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Sophie's desk.
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Yay! Emily!
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Gunther, I quit.
What?!
It sure is.
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
Yeah, I mean whatever.
Sure?
Oh. Oh, that's great!
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Yes, and grumpy.
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
What's your problem?
Pffhah.
Yeah. That's Daddy.
Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
No, we never do that
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
I would love to!
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
Please, just do it!
I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
Oh, somebody will.
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Nooooo, why?
Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
Sure? Thanks.
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
True story.
I thought that was just a rumour.
Um... Done!
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
I don't want to say.
Whose is it?
Oh yeah? Fine.
I gotta get to work.
Oh, that sounds great.
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
Oh, they're real!
Hi! What... . Please tell me those are clip-ons.
I'm thinkin' no.
A joke they would appreciate?
I'm just serving it.
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
No. Have you?
You've never asked a guy out?!!
What?! No! Why?!
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Oh my God, is that still...
Yeah I think so.
Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Oh, the guys are here.
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . .
We use it!!
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
It is? Really?
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
Alright-y then.
Through the glass doors.
Any luck?
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Bye-bye Julie.
See you later Rach.
Meeting Julie.
China.
Noo! Angels.
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Ok... O-k...
This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
Congratulations! Wow!!
Hey!
Still nervous?
Ooh...
How about you guys?
Where are you going?
We're the Cobras!
Yeah! We are!
Some of them.
You mean like for award shows?
All right, bye-bye.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
Yeah, I'm just mad!
Well, deep-deep-deep down!
Yeah. Well, umm.....
Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
Oh no no no.
Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me.
You have a roommate?!
My roommate.
What was the book?
No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
Oh, thank goodness!
But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
I'm so sorry Pheebs.
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Oh! It's not good.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Take it back!
No.
Ohh that's nice.
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Nothing! You go!
Okay, what's going on with you?
I... I... I...
What?
And-and what else?
No more pranks.
Do you know something?
Do you know something?
To be nice.
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
Apartment pants?
And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
Full house.
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Ross! Stop that!
All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
Well I've had it.
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
Oh... That's true.
No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Thank you, Okay, Okay.
Okay, good luck
I'm all better now.
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
As are you...
He's Greek Orthodox.
I bet 20.
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
What's up, Ross?
Okay...
Do what, do what?
You can not do this.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Okay. Wait! Wait!
You tell them to wait!
That's not the end.
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
I went really long.
Hey, where'd you get that?
I do the same thing.
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
No, that's David.
Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?
Well, who wouldn't?!
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
What?! You kissed!
Umm, she kissed me.
I said I'll do it!
Who wants it? Anybody?
Monica! Stop it!
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
So shake it!
Hell yeah!
Isn't that amazing?
Make me rich!!
... the WENUS?
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
What? What carrer?
This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.
Hi! How are you?
Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!
All right, I like that.
No we're not.
Uh... November?
Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
Well, it's nice to know that you...
Space cowboy!
Correct, his profession was?
What... What...
Oh my God!
Yeah but Phoebe...
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
No. No, you can't.
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
I'm gonna do it too!
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
That is so cool.
Oh!
In a month?
Yep!
Joey, had reasons.
By being in a box?
It's All Relative!!
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
Oh! It's you. Hi.
Hey!
Oh come on Ross!!
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
What's up Joe?
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
Well, not this second!
Really? You're not gonna return it?
Oh well, no I...
Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Oh sure it is!
That's not all.
You were with Julie?
Jody!
Right! You're right!
Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
What'd you get?
Sorry-sorry Jill.
What is the emergency?!
What?!
Okay. Every time.
Yeah.
Come on Joey!!!
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Why? What was it?
Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.
Oh, time's up.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Really? How good?
Mmmm! It's good!
Good for you Pheebs!
You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!
I'll get the hat.
Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
Mark? Oh my God!
Rachel?
What are you reading?
Hey, Pheebs!
What are you shushing?
Shhhh!
I mean, this is unbelievable.
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
I'm not gonna gooo.
Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
OK, well, bye.
I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.
Phoebe are you serious?
Totally.
Oh, was it awful?
It's over.
You look so beautiful.
I wanna wear this everyday.
Well, what do you mean?
Well, not just for you.
I thought it was Chandler!
What's the matter with you?!
Oh, come on Ross...
Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
Joey, I can't do that!
But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we're getting rid of her.
...pig...pig man!
...like a...
Bob Buttons?
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Exactly! Unisex!
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
ROSS! end.
Well... Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
That was not funny!
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
Does it hurt?
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
Well um, I don't.
You really serve people sneezers?
So, how are you?
Oh my God!
Hi, remember us?
Yeah, you too.
Uh-huh, go on.
Tag Jones.
Oh, that is so sick.
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
He's not 11!
Or Spin the Bottle?
He's not stoned.
Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.
You really think so?
It's what you want. You should go.
Well, I-I guess-I...
You're into hardcore S&M right?
Aw, I love that.
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
Oh, it's gonna be fine.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Because they're people.
Why do you care?
Oh-oh, you lie.
Yeah, maybe.
Well no brush!
No way!
How was the beach?
Hey!
Hey, hi, hi!
Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.
We didn't change..
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
What did you just say?
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What is that noise?
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
just... don't talk...
but, but..
I'd love to!
I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
All right? Thank you.
All right!
Gimme the keys!
What?! Give-give me a brush.
That's it. Ow!!!
Aww, come on.
We're not actors.
No, they-they weren't in the play.
He is so cute!
Right- where we've been looking all night!
Thanks for dinner.
I'm an eight!
Yeah, what's it about?
The paper.
Oh, get out of here!
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Yeah, what did happen?
Then what did happen?
What, what incident?
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
Joey, you're so sweet.
Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
Thank you. I...yeah.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
Phoebe, that's huge!
Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
You don't have birds.
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
Hey! What's up?!
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
You guys! You guys!
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
No, happy for you!
Happy for you.
Allll done!
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
Calm ourselves?
It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
Funny book?
Some day, maybe.
Ha, tails!
Just flip!
Mmm hmm.
Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .
Smell familiar?
What do you mean?
Sophie sit!!
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
Why would you do that?
I'll watch her.
Ok, maybe you're right.
No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Ahh. Thank you!
Here you go honey!
Well, I like you less!
Okay, how do you feel now?
Pheebs, I was wondering...
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Oh, that sounds good!
So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Monica, let it go.
Hide the Lamp.
Really, really not.
Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you like to make love to me?
Oh my God, Jill!
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Hello, excuse me.
Hang on.
Yeah, like a chimney.
Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
Oh-ohh, thank you.
Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Where are you going?
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
Water it is.
What's a virgin?
Oh, hi Danny.
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Oh, I can give you that.
She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.
Do you have to go?
A year?!
Great!! That's great!
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
What? You're leaving?!
Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
Who's this from?
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Oh, this is so cute.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
But I hired you!
Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
That is so unfair.
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
And did you notice...?
Yeah!
It's OK, it's fine.
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
No!
Oh, that is so sweet!
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
What? What's the matter?
Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...
Shake it off.
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Ohh, what is in that?
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
Oh Ross, you're so great!
Huh.
Monica, what are you doing?
Tomorrow night.
Yeah, it sure is!
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
Was she good?
What?
Okay no, you do it.
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Alright, I got it Ross.
No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
Oh don't even ask!
Is that a swing?
Well, what about Mindy?
No, it was. It was very very good.
No! Help me!
I don't know sweetie.
What are you guys doing?
Excuse me?
Honey, I was wondering....
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
That'd be good.
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
Yeah, four times.
Did he go out for a cigarette?
Oh yeah surfer?
A surfer.
But what about Phoebe?
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
I had one glass.
Two.
Why? I love that thing.
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
That is not a problem.
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
No, I'm still going.
So, you're not going to Paris.
Oh that's what you want.
OK.
Ross, what's the matter?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Oh, this is just terrible.
He's taking off her coat!
What were you thinking?!
That might be fun.
What-what about Monica?
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Okay, just sweep it.
Sorry, I'm sorry. Close, close, close...
Well that was umm...Okay.
Mom, so what did you think?
They're not true?
All those things I said about not being ready...
Ohh! That's so great!
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
That's 'cause you have it.
I, I just never think of money as an issue.
Wait, how long?
You, you go long.
Hey, come on now!
Stick to your side!
Let's go to lunch.
What?!
Y'know, all the women.
What?
Yeah, it's just y'know...
What's the matter? You okay?
God I know, you're right.
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
I'm not reading this!
This is disgusting!
Oh! No, not really.
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Well that too. Joey?
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
What are you doing here!
No, we're late!
Okay. I'll miss you.
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Just one cheek.
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
Just one drink?!
Oh-no-no-no-no....
I need to talk to you!
Hello.
Feel me up?
I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
Who wrote it?
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
That had to hurt!
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Because I already did!
Why not!
Gimme a 'Y!'
L!
I'm sorry, let her?
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
Let me finish.
Done!
Yeah! Excuse me...
And I'm fine never having heard it... Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?
I can't, I gotta go.
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
I need some milk.
Are you okay?
How did it go?
That's right! You do what the hand says!
Oh Ross, you're so great.
I do.
Chandler, what are you doing?
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
So this is Brooklyn.
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
It's kinda slutty.
Really?!
Well, I-I don't like it.
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
Argh. fascist.
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Beefsteak Charlie's?
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's...
Career counselor?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
Diane Keeton.
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
Ew! Gross.
What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.
Fourth gear!!
Who?
Gooood morning!!
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Hardy Boy.
Spiderman?
Here?! Now?!
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Kate Miller?
I know we're not, but Frank Medeio and... Eva Trorro... womba...
Later! La...
Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
Macadamia nut?
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Menstrual cramps.
No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
Merrill Lynch?
What?!
Ow...Oh Gosh!
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
Pancho Vila?
What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget.
Rob Tillman!

OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
mh hmm..
Oh my God!
Well this is romantic!
Sorry!
How did this happen?
Mr. Heckles.
Oh, that must be it.
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
What did you get her?
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
Oh yeah, there you go.
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
Oh my God!! Great!
Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
Why?! What is it?
Pete?!
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
What are you doing here?
Hi!
...I really don't...
You know where Joey is?
Oh my God, what!?
Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
Yeah! I'll cook!
Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
You get your messages!
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Joey, that was formula.
Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
Oohh, I love it!
I love you.
Well, whaddya think?
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Bathroom's up there.
Hi.
Monica, is this true?
This is not good for my rage.
Oh I don't-I don't know.
What?
No luck huh?
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
She's still with you?
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Oh, hi sweetie.
Bona sera.
She said "gleba"!!
And what did she say?
Hi! Oh my gosh!
Oh my God!
Is that the heartbeat?
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
Why didn't you get it?
No.
Oh my God! How?!
Joanna passed away last night.
Well, I'm very impressed.
Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
Okay, I need a date!
Bye-bye!
Oh. That WENUS.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Nice to meet you.
It was nice to meet you Rachel.
Who got married?!
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
Monica, what should I do?
Oh, I-I don't know.
Oh, I can't watch this.
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
I got off the plane.
No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Okay, I gotta go.
We hate that guy.
Basically we just feel that he's...
Ohh, I would love too.
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
C'mon touch it.
That's romantic.
Why, why not?
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Yeah, I-I don't care.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
It's the same story.
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Ross, Joey is not here.
Joey?! Joey!!
Okay, who's next?!
Aww, thank you.
There's nobody here!
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
Thank God. Food.
Pizza guy!
Y'know what you should do?
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Hey, this is hollow.
Hmm, how about my azzz?
Oh, so everything's okay?
Yeah!
Its still there!
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Oh... Bye guys.
Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a cafe, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
Thank you! Break!
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
I am not a pushover!
I am not high maintenance!
What the hell is that?
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
I came with Paul!
What are you doing here?!
Okay, here we go...
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
You fell asleep?!
I fell asleep!
Men are unbelievable.
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Tell Monica I'm sorry.
He left that.
Yeah, fair enough.
Not to me.
Seriously, it's moving!
Oh, it's not!
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
No no no no.
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
Ohh, you're so sweet!
You're so sweet!
Ohh! Me too!
Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
You bought boobs?
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
Chandler! Is he?
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Oh, damn you Geller!
Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
Hey Joey, can I...
All right everyone, lift! And slide!!
Oh my God, what happened?
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Goody, what is it!
Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
Ross gave it to me.
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
I'm so happy for you!
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
Well, this is going well.
You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
What's the other one?
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Seriously, good night!
Good night!
Joey proposed to me.
What?
What's goin' on?
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
God she is unbelievable.
Ew.
How come you are?!
Na-uh, I am!
It's a different guy!
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
Well, people are different.
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
Hey, nice toilet.
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?
Oh.. a little..
Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
No, one of them...
Both of them?
Oh, I would love to!
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
Yeah. Hi Mark!
Rachel?
Hi! Hi Ben!
Hi.
You're jokin' right?
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
Wait, what are you doing?
Well...
Honey, I'm just checking.
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
Right, and the humiliating.
About the yelling.
Let's do it! Ross?
Yay!!
Really? You think so?
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Ross, I really don't think...
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Well, I've been better.
You doing ok?
Okay, I'm totally cool!
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Honey, that's you're name.
Aww, Pheebs.
Did you talk to him?
Hey, Rach, can I get...
A birthday party.
What party?
Oh yeah, go ahead.
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
Oh, you go out with him.
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
How are you doing this?
Is he gone?
Okay? Whoa, wait!
Okay.
Ooh, okay... good.
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Thank you! Thank you!
All right, we'll work it out.
Oh, everything's pink.
All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Oh, that's um, interesting.
I didn't get a cat.
Right, right, yes!
No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
I know them from work.
Who, who are they?
Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Would you guys stop.
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
Oh, that is so tacky.
We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
Thank you! You're great!
Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
Ugh! What grandmother?
Okay. Sorry.
Are you kidding me?
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
Bye, see ya.
Bye.
Really?! Even Ross?
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
Stevie the TV?
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
I can't kiss anyone.
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
And she's not crazy?
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
Wait, are you leaving?
Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
Hey!
Honey, this will help.
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
That's what we decided.
Even if we want it really bad.
What d'you want?
I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
This is ridiculous! I...
We're all getting off. There is no Philange!
Well, what is the truth?
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
But you are a liar.
I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
We're having a party.
Yeah!
So umm, does it?
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
I'm going for a walk.
Us too.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
All right, let's go!
All right Pheebs, your cab's ready.
What?! Are you crazy?
The physical act of love.
When did this happen?
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Okay! Okay! Here!
Rachel, get the book! The book!
I guess you weren't there.
No.
oooh! Oh oh!
Damnit!
Wh-what do you mean?
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
It's coming from Joey!
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
Oh, d'you like it?
Thank you so much for this.
So what are you gonna do?
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
Oh my gosh, Joshua!
Hi.
Ugh! So close!
Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
Where did you get that?
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
We need a hat..
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
But I don't want you to.
But I want to.
I wrote you a letter.
Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
What does she mean?
You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
Not in the street!!
Okay!
Here's your lemonade.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Where ya going?
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Pheebs, that's for men!
Oh, I'll take some of that.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first.
Are you okay Mon?
Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Okay I'll take her, here.
Oooohh that's interesting.
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Wow! How are you?!
Yeah. Right.
That wouldn't help me.
Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
I'm just cleaning up.
...How long was I in there?
Eh! Stop it!
Okay, I'm the baby.
Oh my God! What happened?
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
For Ross, Ross, Ross.
For Ross.
I'm just making margaritas.
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
Well look who's here!
Oh. Hey!
A big idiot.
I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
Really? Mine too.
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
You stole the phone!
Ooh, now you lost me.
This place is amazing.
I-kea! This is comfortable.
Good. How are you?
How are you?
Yeah, umm, no honey.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
Oh, I know, isn't she?
So beautiful.
Ross, you don't seem okay.
Totally.
Wow! What's that like?
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
God. I feel violated.
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
I'll call the super.
It uhh, it won't go back.
Well thank you, you too.
Wow! Happy Monica's night!
Ross said he died.
Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
Ross, it's too hard.
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Oh, he sees her!
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
One two three.
Yeah.
Really? What's that like?
I silk-screen t-shirts now.
I might know something too.
I might know something.
Oh yes! Thank you!
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
No, wait. Wait.
All right, I guess we should go.
Good luck Chandler.
Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Well, they always called.
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
Oh, okay, not so weird.
I was in charge of cups.
Why?! Why not?!
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
Was that the cake?
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Well, I-I said yes.
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
And a thousand dollars.
Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
It's not a big deal!
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
How many you want?
I'm in.
Oh there is no way.
Yeah.
Come on, show me.
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Oh I get it! A...man...duh!
I'm Amanda.
And, I'll be nice.
And you'll be nice?
Well honey, what about you?
Yeah.
It was really... great!
Yeah!
I'm not in love with Ross!
Yeah!
Yes, I realize that...
Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
And you know Monica and Ross!
Hi!
No, what's he like?
A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
Wow! That was amazing!
Uh, why, it's a... one of her favorites, uh, "Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression" eesh! "Love you forever". Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be". . And while he rocked her, he sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be".
I think they're very nice.
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
How do you know about that?
I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
Ethan called again.
What?
YOU! You feel!
Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
Oh? Yeah! Sure!
Hey, do you have any gum?
Oh, honey that's awful.
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Pretty well, actually...
How'd he take it?
I am sooo drunk.
Not her!
What? You didn't get one.
Yes.
I lent them to Ross.
I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
I love it at Joey's!
Really? Its not just frowned upon?
Ben just said hi.
Wha, what?
Nobody does honey.
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
Yes! Y-E-S. Yes!
You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
Ohhh, yeah, me too.
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
All right, let's do it.
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
Hey guys! What's...
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
I don't know all the words.
Okay, what does it mean?
We'll take Literature!!
Nice shooting!
I am so on board!
Absolutely!
By all means.
Shall I carve?
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
It's really not that big!
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
Closer than here?
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
You found my book?!
Where do you think, Zelda?
What is she doing here?
Well, not at first.
Great! Monica's moving!
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Oh great, the pacifiers?
Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Oh, making it worse!
Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning.
All right, I trust you.
Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
Ow. Ow. Ow.
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Oh, what a fun office.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
Yeah, yeah, oh!
I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
... yeah, it's true.
No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
Oh b-b-but it is!
I don't know if it's true.
Yeah, you should, really.
Yeah, you should.
You brought a carrot?!
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
Hey! What's up Mon?
Hey!
No. Well, yeah, maybe.
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
Oh, yeah go ahead.
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Oh no, you're the best.
Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
Wow...definitely just Drake...
And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!
Oh, this one's for me!
Alright, no, we could look at them!
Thank God you're pretty.
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Happy wedding day!
Hey!
They're in a caaar...
What?
Ok, who ordered what?
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
No! They are mine!
Gimme 'em!
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
What 'cha readin'?
Okay. I-I can't watch.
What are you gonna do Pheebs?
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
You found me a guy?
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
Oh, ah with who?
Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Here are your cakes.
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
Oh yeah, I got a cat.
What?!
No! Wait! Come on!
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
I'm going commando, too.
What?
Joey, do you have a minute?
Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Hide my rings.
It's your favorite sister. Ross and Rachel while looking at each other surprised and shocked: Jill? Woman at door in a sing song voice: Amy.
What thing? What thing?
Oh, it was, nah, well....
Yeah. Nice try!
I loved them!
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Better than Chandler.
Oh I know.
Yeah, great, you betcha!
Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
Alright. Thats it!
Uh, yeah I think I did.
Well, Ross said my name.
Hi, so what happened?
Gimme an 'I!'
M!
Gimme an 'L!'
I!
Gimme an 'M!'
E!
What?! We can't do that!
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Only like a month!
What... for how long?
Yeah! I got my girls.
You okay?
Joey! Sit down!
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
What?! What? What happened?!
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
You're not an artist.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Hey! How was basketball?
aaand SEND! Opening credits.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
Joey! Joey, good one!
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
What bank is this?
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
He offered me one.
How did the job stuff go?
Ohh, hi, Kim.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Oh-hooo, I missed you.
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
Hey! Got champagne?
Hey!
You know? Forget it!
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
What? Guys, I'm not.
When are you coming home?
Yeah! That would be great!
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
OOH! God! Sorry!
RACHEL!
Well, now I don't have to.
You still don't know my name, do you?
A thousand bucks.
Yeah? How much?
She needs changing.
You are not going to regret this.
Monica's making jam.
What is this? Fruit?
I wanna say a disease.
So what was it for anyway?
Yeah? You like that one?
That's a good one.
I think I'm gonna take off.
Yeah...
Barry who I almost.
Barry who you almost...?
Yes! Did you see that?
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Joey, it would mean so...
No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
Sure, what's up?
Okay. I am so hot!
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
I already fed her.
Try feeding her again.
Don't call us that!
Hi! How are the Gellers?
No you don't know why!
I know why!
Well, what about my stuff?
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Hey, guys, what's up.
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
Is-is he coming?
No that's my assistant.
With Ross and Jill?
Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
It's Le Poo.
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
Oh, she's still napping.
Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Very nice touch.
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Okay, let me just change.
Thank you.
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
All the time!
Ohhhh, come on!!!
No.
Because, he's my friend.
Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
I have absolutely no idea.
Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
I'll figure something out.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
Uh, credit card.
How'd you pay for them?
Well I. . .
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
What, is everything ok?
Hey...
Ohh, not compared to you.
And Milton Berle has a...
Really?! How do you know?
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
Did you just say Emma?
Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.
Sure, is she married?
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
No way, forget it.
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Said what? Exactly.
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
...it's gonna be okay!
I've got cold feet.
Are they in love?
I don't know.
Stop picturing it!!
Hey Rach.
I always loved that!!
She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
What's the matter with you?
Hhhiiii.
It's not the time Charlie.
Actually the wet season is June to December.
Did uh, Ross call?
Hey.
Yeah, I don't think so Joe.
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
What the hell was that?!
Ross!!!
Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Oh, well...
Oh yeah, sure, that too.
Or incredibly offensive.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
And thank you for your time.
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
So, how was the party?
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
Oh, ok, which one?
I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.
I will. Ross, come here.
Call us when you get there.
Well, I just called Joshua...
Plus, you look cool.
Oh Amy, you remember Ross.
Hey Amy.
Oh... you're so sexy!
Oui, bien sur je parle Francais! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
Oh yeah, what's it about?
I am good. I finished my book.
Oh... okay, just hide!
No idea what it means.
But, it's not raining.
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
His new girlfriend!
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
Because I'm going to London.
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
Well, thank you, Melanie.
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
We were on a break!
Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
Ooh, it was only okay.
Y'know, I never saw that.
Well, what would we be doing?
Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
Close call day.
Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!
Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
D'oh!! I've got it!
No!
Hi, how was the movie?
...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Did you just push me?
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!
Do you want my pickle?
I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
Good luck, honey!
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Oh, youre gonna be great!
I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
What-what-what are you gonna do?
But you live here! You know that.
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Monica, you asked the question.
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
And I will see you tomorrow!
They're still just friends, right?
Well, yeah, this is the deal.
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
On TV?! Yeah!
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
A-alright! I can do this.
See?
Oh, I know. Look at him.
He is so amazing.
Well hello !
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Joey, why would you do that?
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
Sorry!
Uhh, hang in there?
You're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
No, it's okay, you didn't know.
Great. I feel like an idiot.
Oh Chandler, stop talking!
Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
All right, I got 48.
Oh, okay, time's up!
OK, that's dead right?
C'mon.
What? C'mon, talk to me.
Naa.
You said she was bald.
Thanks! You too.
Huh. A moo-point?
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Yeah, you're on your own.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
I won't boss you around.
You won't boss me around anymore?
Hey, how'd it go?
Hey!
Oh! Weather bitch!
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!
Ok, we're still on that.
My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
Op! You're peeping!
Okay Rach, but...
Thank you. Oww!!!! God!
Okay?
Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
What are you going to make?
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Does it still hurt?
Yeah.
Oh, can we read them?
Hey!
Fine! We went out.
Then tell him quickly.
Oh, come on squeeze it.
No.
I bet you're a Gemini.
You're an Aquarius, huh?
Do you guys want these?
Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
My God, get a room!
Mmh... this cake is amazing!
I can't believe this is happening.
Well, we could count again.
Wha... the next one?
Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
Hey. Got a second?
Nooo!
Then what's gonna happen?
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
What are you playing with?
I could do that.
Eh, do you believe that?
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
I did not sell you out.
You sold me out.
Give it here. Oh, God.
Yeah.
Pheebs, I have to ask you...
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
Not at all inappropriate!
Very informative!
No-no, I bought those.
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
Oh, she does want to.
No! I do want to!
Hel-lo, Rachel Green.
Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
No, no, ACC-cept that.
E-except, except that what?
Run Phoebe run.
Hey, hey, no, oh oh.
Sandy made Madeleines.
Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... These are amazing!
Ahhh! Ooh, nice!
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
Oh yeah, no, what's that?
Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
What do you really want to do?
Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
Oh! What are we gonna do?
Ooh! We have a problem.
I don't have ten minutes!!
Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
And everybody knows this?
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
I can't say that I'm surprised.
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
So were done then!
I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
Let me get my coat.
I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
It's Robert Bobby.
He's Bobby Bobby?
It won't come off!
What?!
Ah, this place is great!
You know, we should just go, I'm not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
You're bachelor pad?!
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
Ohhhh!! ...What? What?
That's all!
Okay, see? I told you!
That was unbelievable!
Hello! Here we go!
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
We're gonna find love!
It's okay, I got a plan.
A couple of bucks.
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Here you go. Thank you!
I guess so.
No, you gotta pick one!
Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
Chandler, what did she say?
Chandler!
Hey guys! What's up?
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
Ehh, pardon me?
Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.
So seriously...rodeo clown?
Don't be. It's just bad timing.
Thank you. What a bitch.
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
Allison's birthday party.
Who's birthday party?
Oh! Oh, I love that but.
But...
Well where's Amanda?
No, sorry.
Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
Wait, what am I gonna do?
Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
Ohh, well you got 'em.
Yeah we do!
What is he doing here?!
Hi!
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
Right!
Uh.... its Emma.
Is this Emmett?
Yes! Hell yes!
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
Um... my... father.
And who pays for that?
Wow! What do you do now?
Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
But I am going hunting!!
Thank you.
Do you have any ice?
Hey.
...Jack from downstairs?
You are just like Jack.
Hmmm... this is so nice.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Well there's an idea!!
Maybe you could be my roommate!
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
I know!
I'm an assistant buyer!!
Phoebe, wait a minute!
Ooh... I love Barbados!
Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
It's a, it's a cat!
What the hell is that?!!
What are you guys doing here?
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
I'm already here.
No! Not at all!
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
Hello darling.
Music. Very nice.
I guess they're back from their date.
Ohh that'd be great!
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
How are you holding up?
Hey.
Do we have to tell her?
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
No, I-I-I love it there.
You don't?
Wow! What did he say?
And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
You don't have any secrets!
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
Tip of the iceberg.
There's a third guy?
Hmmm... Me too...
I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.
Ooh, I have another idea!
Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
OH MY GOD!!!
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
OK, gook luck.
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
The job is in Paris.
Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
But I insist harder!
But I insist!
No, but you know what I mean.
I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
I'll be out in a second.
Rach?
Oh, are you sure you're ok?
No.
Good luck to ya!
Well hello! I'm Ross!
Well I-I think your wrong.
But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
Who are these men?
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Ooh, I've been better...
You all right?
Afraid to ask him?
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
I've never wanted you more.
Mi-mi-mii.
I hate when Ross is right!
Thank you.
Ross, say something. Anything.
Ross? Can we just close the door?
Just get out! Now!!
No!!
It's me! Good morning!
Who's out there?
Oh, they're firemen guys.
They're nice guys.
When you were in China.
Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
So what happens next?
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
Can I see that for second.
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Well, so what're you gonna do?
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
That is the most ridiculous.
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
And the video camera?
That makes sense!
You said she was bald!!
You said it was okay!
It's so not a big deal!
NO BIG DEAL!
Can I ask you a question?
At least tell me where you hid it.
What? They were like this!
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Do you want some pancakes?
Yeah?
Monica, I'm your best friend.
Thank you.
Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Well neither do I!
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
Who is being loud?
I warned you...
Well I-I-I'm not moving.
Well believe it baby!
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
Two, two babies?
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
The oven is on.
Care for a cherry?
Hi!
Do you want me to quit?
Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
No-no, but I support it.
Really! You-you sail?
Hey, who's Phoebe with?
Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!
Well, so what does he do?
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Come on you gotta have one!
No.
Little village people.
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!
Um, Russ, you ready?
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
Oh yes!
The burping clogs?
In the closet.
The lights, please..
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
Uh! The police!
It's the police!
Just get away from me!
Rachel?
So, how was your date?
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
No. She doesn't die.
Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
Oh! Emma might like what?
Hey, I think Emma might like it!
Hips or thighs?
hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
Oh, look at the little cat!
Yes, yes, that's right...
Oh, hi! How are you doing?
It's up to you.
Why didn't I get that message?
Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? You've been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn't even have the courtesy to tell me.
... Ok, who is this?
Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.
If you hold a spider.
Good.
Hey! So, did you quit?
Hey.
Ugh, she is a slut!
Who? Is that your sister?
Is Joey Tribbiani here?
Hey Rachel.
Op! We gotta go!
That's much better.
You do that every year??
I do it every year.
I just had a rough night.
Hey, what's wrong?
Would you let me talk.
Yes you did. Absolutely.
You heard them say that?
Yeah!
No, I can't, I have a baby.
You can do the presentation.
Oh, no! Who did that?
Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
How did you make $17.
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
Hi, thanks for coming.
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Monica, what are you talking about?
Hey, here's a thought.
This is totally your fault!
Porsche.
But you could teach us.
No.
Oh... Italy, I think.
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Did you watch the tape?
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
You think about stuff like that?
What?
Ohh we're not sailing.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Wait, so, you're going?
I'll be right down.
We weren't doing anything!
Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
I love working with designers!
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
Sophisticated like a hooker?
Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Hey! What's goin' on?
I would love that job!
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
Come on! Here.
Okay! Check it out!
Yeah!
Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
Yeah, he broke those too.
Well, he had gravity boots.
But why, why not?
NO, NO! It can't happen at all!
Hey. I need to tell you something.
Hey.
Please, what about you and Chandler?
No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
You seem to really like her.
What do you mean?
OK, ready when you are.
Ahh.
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
What 'cha doing Mon?
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
Well, well I can up with it!
The name was my favourite part!
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Don't touch my coat!
Really?
All right. Be sexy.
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
Why, where are you going?
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
I'm gonna get back to retraining.
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.
Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
Great! I'll call ya!
Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
I almost caught that one!
Over here!
Oh, but of course it is!
Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
Monica is Ross' sister.
Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.
So, um, did she...
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
Ohh, that is soo sad.
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
I haven't seen it yet!
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
No that could kill her.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Ok, let's keep talking.
I'm gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.
So, will you talk to him?
Can you people not see me?!
Awful, absolutely awful.
You look like a freak.
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Ive never done that.
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Oh, it ended very well.
Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
They have that on the napkins at the club.
Phoebe, come on that's silly.
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
Oh my God! Are you serious?!
What?
Sure. You got it. Great!
I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London-well Shropshire really but y'know-well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening?
Why aren't you at work?
Hi.
Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
Oh, is this the bug lady?
Phoebe, you have to calm down.
But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
Would you like some pancakes?
Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
What'cha gonna' do?
Whatever.
Who gave you that hickey?
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
I can't believe you would say that!
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
What? Why? Where are you?
Damnit!
I cannot push it in!
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
I was just getting him to like you.
Hi Ross.
Oh my God! Look at this!
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
You kissed my girlfriend!
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...
Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
You have all the answers, don't you?
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
I also said number one.
You said number two.
Oops sorry, my mistake.
That's Hanson.
Then how come it is?
Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm...
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
I didn't. I got under him.
How'd you get over that teacher?
Ooh, the gift shop!
Where do you want to start?
More than jewelry.
Women really want this?
Because a car backfired?
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Is he okay in there?
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
It was nice to meet you.
Pleasure.
Ok. See you, bye.
Yeah.
Okay. We'll be right back.
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Well, what are you going to wear?
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
Well, what is the other reason?
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
There. Now there is.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
In Human Resources!!!!!!
Who?!
With Ross and my sister?
Yeah!
Well that's his last name.
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
What is the matter with us?
OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Uh, I'm holding Ben.
What're you doing?
So all we have is ice?
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
All right, I'm outta here!
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
That is the most ridiculous...
You had no right to go out with him.
Jill! Did you shop?!
Hey!
Well that sounds fun too.
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
You know what I really really want?
Okay.
Now I love you even more.
Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
That's not what we're gonna do!
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
Still in love with?!
Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
Oh! I used to do that too!
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
What, isn't he sober?
It's Fun Bobby.
I think he's stealing from me.
What?
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
...Dinah?
I didn't... I never said that.
'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
Well what happened at dinner?
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
Why? What's the big deal?
Wow.
What happened to uh, MEG.?
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
I know. I know. I've feeling.
Look, I-I know it's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma and...I've been feeling.
Do you think I'm someone else?
I know why I don't remember her, huh?
Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.
Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
Hi... I'm on a date...
Rachel?
Ow, you stop flicking.
Quit flicking
I really think you need to go now.
What?
Well why shouldn't I?!
Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.
Uh, yeah, if you want too.
May I come in?
That's a good call. Right.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
Uh-huh... right... yeah...
And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Go on! Go on.
He took off?
What is the matter with you?!
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
So what-what is the exhibit.
Yeah.
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Noo way, Kevin.
Can we please turn this off?
Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Hey! Hiya!
Its back in cage!
Is it back in the cage?
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
He's like a big disgusting...
Oh he's like a...
You were gonna propose to me?
What?!
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
You pierced her ears!?
Ta-daaa!
Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
Ow, that had to hurt!
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
May fifth, why?
When's your birthday?
Then why do you ask?!
Give me two.
Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Did you know he was in there?
Hey.
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
Is someone there?
Oh, Joey, look who it is.
I'll be right back.
No, I couldn't let you do that.
You know, I would give her up, for you.
Yeah, don't push it though.
So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
through the glass doors.
Have a seat through the glass doors.
Just stop it! Come on!
Me too! Me too! Me too!
This time it's not so funny.
You're not laughing.
Ooh, let's open them!
And the big one's for me!
You're never leaving the apartment!
Yes I am!!
Ohh! My God! Barry!!
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
So what's going on with you?
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
Alright fine. I'll do it.
Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Huh, Bob Saget?
Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
They're male nurses.
Oh my!
There's more alcohol, right?
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
Now, does it really matter?
Before!!
Phoebe? Is everything okay?
Uh, Rach, hang on.
Oh, you're welcome a million.
Thanks a million.
No, God! Please, let me!
I'll get it.
OK, well, bye-bye again.
Well, bye for me too.
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
What the hell are doing?!!
No-no, it's really not huge.
Oh no!
Yes, you're having a boy!
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
Oh my God, honey that's great.
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
Something to do with numbers?
Good, so do I
Are you gonna let me play?
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Because I lose her stuff!
Why not?
I don't know. The left one.
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
It's so secluded up here.
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
Ewww, is that what that is?
That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
All right fine, I pick you.
Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
Honey, we have been through this before!
...I mean it's my fault.
Ohh.
Ahh, so do you, beautiful.
Oh, you look so great.
The bll is drrbing!
What?
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
I mean you definitely should do that.
Yeah!
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
Aah... I bet you're right.
I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
Ha, I made you look....
And your fly's still open...
This is just occurring to you?
Im gonna be a father.
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Because! Because I was sad.
Okay! Why?!
Joey! We should just switch.
Ross!
Well, how did you find out?
Yes.
How is it going with Charlie?
Hey Ross!
Wow... I really love your...
Time for your scalp massage!
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
What?
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
You ok?
Could I get some peanuts?
I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.
Oh, no no no no no.
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
He carries a briefcase.
And processing.
Yeah, I forget which ones.
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
That was kind of rude!
Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus...
OK, OK, it's my turn.
That's a bird!
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Who are you supposed to be?
Hello, Zelda.
Oh, that's great. Look at that.
Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
Good, you guys are all here!
I take it.
Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
Well you did a little bit.
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Well now what's the rush?
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Does anybody need anything?
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
What do you, what do you mean?
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
I think he's across the hall.
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
What?! You say that to kids?!!
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
Just washing the windshield.
What do you think you're doing?!
Oh, howd she take it?
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Thank you. Thank you so much!
You owe me 20 bucks.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Ok, so let's talk money.
He didn't have any.
It's a uh, regatta gala.
Yeah, what's the gala for?
We won. We won!
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Joey, we're not keeping this!
I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
Hey! Hey what's going on?
Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Oh wow, this feels weird.
Thank you.
I don't know where the phone is.
I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
"Oh, my, god."
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Huh ha ha!
I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
My God! What happened to you?
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
No! I'm so happy for them!
Not that often!
Is he romantic with her?
I don't know.
Honey that sounds like fun.
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Just sit over there!!
Huh?
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Well, I'd have to say gay.
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Then why would you say that?!
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
So you like the short hair better.
I didn't know there were docks.
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Oh! What's new in sex?
That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
Yeah. A year ago..
Well that's great! Congratulations!!
Oh... Oh boy... Hi...
Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... In New York... it's...
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
Honey, I love you too.
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Rachel, wait, wait.
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
No Joe, no miracle.
So, there was no miracle?!
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
I can't find garbage bags!
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Okay, okay. I hate this.
Probably just the first half.
Y'know maybe a little bit!
I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
How've you been?
Thank you. So are we good?
I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
Tag? Hi, who was that?
Rachel Green's office.
You are soo enjoying this.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
Oh honey, but it is just about...
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
What?! You got us evicted!!
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
Oh yeah? Since when?
Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.
Well, h-how is this like that?
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Her dancer friends?
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Did you just break the radiator?
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
I don't want you to see me naked!
What?
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Ross, you're like my best friend.
No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
Then what? What do you want?
No.
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
Yeah.
Wha. . . hey!
But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Okay.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
She asked-asked you out again?
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
Hey, thanks Rach.
What?! She made the tea!
What?!
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
All right Ross!! I get it!!
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
Oh my God! That is so good!
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
What thing? What is this thing?
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
Okay, should we get some coffee?
We got some time.
What are you, what are you doin'?
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.
Joey asked me marry him.
Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
Really.
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Amazingly, that makes sense.
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Oh my.
Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
Hi!
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
Well, then can we meet him?
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Hey guys!
We'll be right back sir.
Sure!
Ooh, your brother. Score!
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Well try to keep it down.
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Wow! I did not see that coming.
No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
Well no, I don't smell anything.
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
We're paying for this y'know.
Both!
"Yeah." "Me neither."
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."
"Yeah." "Me too."
No. No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go. "Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."
4 o'clock. Food?
Uh, here. What time?
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Ha, I made you look....
Well, I would like to have the option!!
Do you wanna go hunting?
He's not having an affair!
OH! He's having an affair.
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
There are seven?!
I didn't know you guys hung out.
Yeah.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
Wow, look at these prices.
Oh please, they're having sex.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
Just pull on it.
Maybe you should put it off.
OK, now I'm nervous.
Where the hell've you been?
Yo- hooo!
Do you wanna play football?
What?
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
Hey.
Come on! I think this is funny!
What?
And um, what-what is that Ross?
So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
Say more things like that.
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
Because he's stealing from me!
Why?
Okay. Let's use this brush.
Ohh.
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
All right!! Fine! Fine.
No! Come on!
Do I have my own castle?
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
You want me to see a therapist?
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Huh.. How about 600?
The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
What a bad idea!
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Did you get your money back?
Ohh-Do you think he will?!
That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
She-she died Jill.
What?
Did-did you take these back?
Hmm?
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Not even one more time?
Hmmm-mmmm.
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
What?!
We have to get her a present?!
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.
What are you talking about? We're all together right now.
Wow! This place is fabulous!
...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
I can't tell you what I know.
Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
Don't touch my coat!
I know, I still need to talk to you.
Uh Dad, Emma's in the nursery. I'll take you now. If you want, but I really want to talk to you.
You put these on my desk!
Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
Three of your five, what?
Okay, I've got three of my five.
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...
So what are you guys going to do?
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Joey, where are those bags?
You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws And suddenly I am the bad guy?
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Oh, come on!
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Rach, come see who's out here!
You remember when we got these?
Oh God!
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
OK, then get me your purse.
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
It's open! Hi, Joe!
Oh! Weather bitch!
God I'm just a horrible person.
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
She you in the parking lot.
Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
So, uh, how was your day?
Woah, hey, yo.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Aww, look at the little thing.
That little naked guy would be me.
Well, you were pretty damn good.
More importantly, was I any good?
You give me back my Walkman!
Fine!
Why the hell didn't you tell me!
Thank you, Okay, Okay.
You were gonna drink the fat.
Well, yeah.
I think you should drink the fat.
What?
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Yep! That's hilarious!
What is this? Ross, what is this?
All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
So now what have we agreed?
I know! Robin is so gay!
Oh and I'll call ya too!
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
You guys wanna get some coffee?
No, this is pretty much it.
Monica, will-will you marry me?
Funny one! That's good!
No-no, I'm staying put.
So I understand you're looking for a place.
IF you hold a spider.
WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
Because I knew you were lying!
Then why did you move?!
Whoa, how do you know about that?
The guy you gave your number to.
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
What song was that, Pheebs?
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
So you know how to fix it?
Yeah, this has happened before.
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
AND YOU KNOW!!!
YOU KNOW!!!!
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
Hello! Ohh, kids love me.
Ahh.
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
leave...
What? You really think she's hot?
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
How did it go with Erin?
Hey!
But we should move quick.
But we should take it.
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
No thanks, I've already seen one.
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
Do you have a minute?
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
No so we're protecting her.
Well, we don't want that.
That is the Coast Guard.
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
I just, I feel, I-I just...
What?!
Oh wow! This is so cool.
Oh my God!
Really! That-that great huh?
Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
We're the Bings.
What did, what did he say?
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
I don't really care about the Knicks.
Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Hi! It's me.
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
I want to keep one.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
We are looking at a Playboy.
Wh-wh-what are you doing?
Awww, just like his daddy.
Don't talk to me now!
No. A break from us.
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
You let Joey drive it?!
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Let's dry 'em again.
Uh, moist, yeah.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
Oh so-so not really never.
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Oh come on, I already went.
Oh, Rachel.
Oh, look at her, so happy!
WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
Because I think it means more to you.
No, I think that was the whole all.
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
I really mean it.
Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
Really?! You think that will work?
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Okay, well, we won that one.
They have another guess.
What is this? What are we doing?
OK, that's dead right?
I didn't know you could get married here.
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
I said it's still nap time.
Ah, and where is Joey?
Oh, oh. . What is this?
Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but I do have something for you.
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
Ross, there is no us, OK.
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
So now, what are you doing here?
Always nice to meet a fan!
Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
You stole them from me!!
You stole them from me!
It'll be a short one.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
So maybe something in an office.
I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
Alright! Enough out of you!
And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
Ok. If you really need to.
Still-still, let me come... for me.
Monica, where did you get these?!
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Hi!
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
And I'm going to go get drunk.
Well, what-what 'cha got there?
Hi!
You've being seeing someone?
Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
I meant, me plus one!
But you said one.
It's a pretty cool tux.
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
Eh. Beth dies.
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
Oh.. Never mind. Who are you?
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
Oh. Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Hide my rings.
Well, look at that, same thing.
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Joey, you have got to take this back!
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
How'd it go with Pete?!
Hey!
Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
I pick you, Phoebe.
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
He could hear me.
Ooh great! Very Monica.
Finger sandwiches and tea.
So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Can't do it, can you?
No, was he any good in it?
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Turned out it was a hat.
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
You're out of Diet Coke.
I know. Hand me a tissue.
You're out of toilet paper!
How?
Throw in the duck too!
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Me too. Come here.
I want the little round waffles.
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
Hi, hi can I help you?
Hi.
What-what are-what are these?
Hi!
Well why didn't you take the job?
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Such a pig!
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
No thanks. I'm 29.
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Take it like a man, Ross!
Stay away!
Ross, what is taking you so long?
Well, now I don't have to.
Why would I have to sleep with you?
Me.
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
Not bad.
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut.
It's yours!
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
You dont even have cats.
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
Well, well, you said it was practice!
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Oh no! Not me! Emma!
You wouldn't let her have a grape?
No, it was just the three of us.
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
And um...You look nice today.
Happy New Year, Joey!
You too!
Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Just calm down woman!
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
How's the big anniversary dinner?
Men just take out wind?
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
I can't... I can't hear it again.
Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
Rachel, calm down!
What're you guys doing out here?
Hey.
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
I knew it!
Oh God, I really had a good time!
Well, it felt French.
I think it could be kind of great!
Well, do you think I should propose?
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
What?! What else did he say?
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
Oh... what an interesting name.
It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
Yes. You're not asking are you?
Really?
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Why aren't you home yet?!
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Pretty uhm, different huh?
I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
Excuse me, there was no time!
What?!!
I've got some bad news.
Yeah, huh.
I don't get this! She was horrible!
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
No, yeah, Ive done that.
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
You mean, you mean 30 days?
Yeah!
It's worse than the thumb!
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
Sure we should... So.
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Heey man, I work out.
No! What are you going to do? Make me?
That's a good story, Grandpa.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Because, uh-it has to.
Why?
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
You kissed him?!
No, you know what, I think you should go.
I get it! Well, that's that.
Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
Yeah, you too.
Op, I like credit cards!
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
I don't know...right, he's the pig!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
It's not random, it's Bob.
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
Oh! My hero! What happened?
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
Dear Lord.
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
You are having a party tonight??
Stupid Jane Rogers!!
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Because! You're mean on the boat!
Would anybody like more coffee?
There's an image.
Well, get back in there and talk!
I didn't say anything yet!
Well relax, he'll be here.
Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Hey!
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
God!! What am I gonna do?!
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
I - I have to get on the plane.
Miss?
Okay, what? What is too sensitive?
Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Sophie's desk.
All right, it won't come off!
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
No, you could've lost your job.
No, don't worry about it.
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Which one do you think she is?
Lotsa things.
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
Okay. Oh, yeah... Oh he's cute!
Please...
Op, ice. I need ice.
Diet Coke.
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Well then I demand a recount!
I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
And... taped back together.
This has been torn up.
We love you, we're here for you.
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
Eh, no problem.
How is that the silver lining?
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
No, no-no, Ross Geller.
How often do you read it?
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
We got some really great stuff!
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Just for a second.
Wh-You dated my sister!
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Hey.
Shake that nasty butt...
Shake it!
I am so hot for you right now.
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Well, that's because of a lot of...
Why not?!
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
OK, Phoebs. But what about you?
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
Can you?
What? Oh my God! To who?
Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Oh no!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Oh, thank you so much! Okay.
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
That's right.
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Why isn't it working out?
Could tonight be the Night?
What?
Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars.
Good luck.
She dropped off a casserole?
I did?
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
You want me to talk you out of it?
No.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Ok honey, you really need a job.
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Joey, did you my face cream?
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
That's because he's on your neck.
There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
Hey, how'd the interview go?
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
She didn't hang up either!
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up either...
Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Phoebe did the signs!
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
With ah, extra anchovies.
No anchovies.
Can any of you watch Emma?
I don't think that's what this is.
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
No you really think that's what it is?
Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
Okay.
Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Oh, that's Ross's.
Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go...
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
No.
I don't care about any of that!!
Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"
No its really okay... Monica!
Well, that's what I'm here for. Want me to get that?
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Okay!
Does anybody want anything else?
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Well, I-I could live without it.
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
Ok professor or detective?
I thought you came to say you were sick.
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
I don't want to say.
Well look, if you don't like this...
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
And a crappy New Year.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Ok Monica: We will!!
Call me.
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
You completely stole my answer!
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Yeah well unless we tell him.
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
OK honey, you're dating Ross.
Can somebody please go in?
Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
High-five, the babies are coming!
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
I found it!
Wow. She does that a lot!
You, touching yourself, out!
No. I was just going to do this myself.
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
Then what's with all the bananas?
I don't have a monkey.
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
Oh, no no, I am.
Not even with your best friend.
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
Jurassic Park could happen.
I do not always have to be-okay, okay.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
I'm 30!
You are ready to make a commitment!
You're there!
Would you excuse me for a second?
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.
Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? I thought you were a doctor.
Uhh... I think I just got engaged.
Are you all right?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
Sit down! We're winning!
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
You really think it would be that different?
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
Okay.
All right. I'm a total pro!
Thank you! Good meeting you.
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
I did not know you spoke French.
It was ok...
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
Okay. I'll be right back.
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Oh, I read that in high school.
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Okay! All right! How was she?
No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
We took our apartment back!!
What the hell is going on?!
You're just staring into space.
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Time is money my friend?
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Uhh, we still need a tip.
I love you too.
You went shopping for fur?
Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
Oh wow! Look at this place!
Merry Christmas!
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Or not.
I've never lived like this before.
Yeah! Look!
Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
...It's kinda hard though!
Uhm, right!
I could not have done this without you.
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
You just did a little dancy thing.
What?
It was only 500 bucks.
How much was it?
Now that she broke up with you?
A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
I was tired!
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I... I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have...
And Monica, what are you going to make?
Yummy noises.
And all these people actually died?
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Does anybody need more coffee?
Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
All right, so we weren't prepared!
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
And your fly's still open...
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
Okay! All right, pick a half.
What do we use to split it?
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
So did you break up with Joanna?
Two hours, that lasted!
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
And Mindy, your maid of...?
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
No! No dessert, just a check, please.
Well, then so you just invite me...!
You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
I-We gotta get Monica.
All right, straight, and not subtle.
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
Were both of those Joey?
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
God. You seem really, really nice.
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
So umm, what's this book about?
Hi!
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
Isn't that mine?
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
has your girlfriend got the butt?
Yeah!
How have you never been on Oprah?
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
Look, I'll just give you this and go.
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Well, in a nutshell. . .
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
Bye.
You all know? Does Ross know?
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
That's too bad.
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
It depends on who asked.
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
No! God, would you just calm down!
Sophie sit!!
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
Could I play?
Any sign of your brother?
Hey!
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
You are?
Oh my God! My dog died!
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
Because I promised Mindy I would.
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Break!
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
Think about it.
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Fine.
Well what is it? Let me see.
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
The job is in Paris. FADE OUT.
He got it a flea market!
Sure!
Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
What, the word hi?
...how about I move in with you?
Oh!
What...how is it going with Drake?
What?
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
He didn't get the goggles!
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
You look familiar, have we...
Huh. Does Monica know about this?
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
Me too! So happy for them!
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Right, I'll see you guys later...
..Naughty!
Hey, you.... So, what's up?
Hey, you.
But he has to know how I feel!
You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I'm afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Okay, okay, you got it!
You're fly is open, Geller!
That money is mine, Green!
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
What's going on?
Okay, go to the left. The left!
I don't know why you just don't say left.
I get to hire my own assistant!
Oooh!
Down at the docks again?
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
Oh, ye-ah!
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross!
Great set tonight Phoebs.
Phoebe's got another job, right?
Could you please get her attention?
's a good toast.
Oh, don't be such a baby! end.
You're mean!
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Hi!
Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
Hey, do you guys have... ...hi.
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
Wow, he must like you the best.
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
What? You don't want me to get a job?
No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Geez Ross, you could have showered.
Okay Marjorie, hit it.
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
Not after this!
But I told you, I didn't have the time!
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
Ball? There is no ball.
Great. So the ball is in his court?
: We have apple cinnamon...
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
Why-why aren't you more excited?
Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
Would you just open it?
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
So, did you shave your legs?
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!
Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
So it would just be, me alone?
Oh, she isn't home.
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
About what?
What, the blonde with no bra?
Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
I don't feel like talkin.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
No, not a problem.
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
All right. Okay. I'm starving!
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Oh!
All right are you guys gonna come down?
Oh.
I don't even know how I would go about it.
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
I know, I can do more than cook.
Oh my God!
Let us keep the apartment and...
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
So you eh, you talked to Joey?
Hi!
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
So how's it goin' with Joey?
Okay.
No matter how much we want it.
Not even once.
Get out, get out of my apartment.
Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
She won a thousand dollars!
I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
Yeah but, he's not your type.
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Of course, I'd be honored!
Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
Foot rubs for a month!
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
It's over! You have to accept that.
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
Come on, they were not that huge.
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Yeah do it now, call right now.
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Nah, I don't really want her to see.
Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. .
He doesn't speak much English.

No-no, they're not very nice people.
Are you close with them?
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
Hi Jill.
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Oh that's so great!
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
You didn't break up with that fireman?
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
Oh my God you stole her award!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Hey! Rachel!
Uh. Did you call your parents?
I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
Hey, that was an honest mistake!
Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
Well, apparently he scares easy.
Noo. Why?
Time's up, now your dead.
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
No, we kinda broke up instead.
Ohhh, nice.
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
I'm not going to do that.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Electrical plans for the building.
And that makes you angry because...
Our apartment is ready.
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Did you call the cops?
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
They're here already? How are they doing this?
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
Why?!
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
You are asking me to be your wife!
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
There's no room under the bed.
Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
So, uh, he's back.
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
Was your basket on top?
"Dude, Where's My Car?"
Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
Here, let me help you.
Good day for married people huh?
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Oh, right!
How long do cats live?
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
How about at a game, on the big screen?
Off to see young Ethan?
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Joey has got a secret peephole!
What's going on?
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Okay, let's go running!
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
I got a really incredible job offer.
Ooh, what's going on?
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
I made them!
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
And stop saying that! I hate that!
Okay.
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
That's a line from the show too!
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
NO, no science camp!
Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
I think she's here.
How can you not remember us kissing?!
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
So can we keep this between us?
Yeah.
How come you didn't come over earlier?
Hi.
Your fly is open, Geller.
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
Right.
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
And I do have one seat left.
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
You can't do anything!
Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Hi!
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
That's weird, she locked the door.
Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Hey!
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Really?! I mean, really?!!
I mean it's the end of an era!
I'm gonna miss you!
Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
I knew you didn't get a 1400!
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
Yep.
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
You didn't propose to me. Joey did.
I don't think you do.
Come on, I don't know what else to do.
Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
Happy birthday sweetie.
I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
What, what's it, what's going on?
Okay. Oh, no!
I'll help you throw out your purse.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
I can not believe your trading me!!
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
So, I'll umm...
You would do that? I never get picked!
Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Whe-where did he put it?!
And you really think this is a good idea?
Are you kidding? I'm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.
Look, either help me or go.
Rachel...
I haven't seen him in so long!
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
I thought you only met him once?
No, but he's always late.
Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in.
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!
Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.
Okay that is the one we already have!
On your dresser.
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Hi! Hey!
Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
First of all, I'm not losing...
Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Pretty good.
People are trying to sleep in here!
Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
Ok, use it in a sentence.
That almost hit me in the face.
Here you go.
Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
So-so, what do you want for lunch?
You never come into this office again!
Never!
How many guesses do you get?
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
It's not funny, this is actually my job.
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
So, what should you have done?
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
What? Shut up! We're winning!
That's not even a game!
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
Who are you saying "check" too?
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Fine.
It's not? When was she born?
No, it's not!
Honey don't worry, it was my mistake.
Y'know what you guys? I'm uh, I'm gonna go too. And uh, I'm sorry about everything.
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
Hey!
I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
I mean he just started going out with her.
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
Take the top down did ya?
Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
Since when do you watch the news?
Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
You have a play date with a stripper?!
Yeah.
Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
Hey.
See? Now, he could date her.
That's not what she said last night.
You can't, because of the new skylight!
Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Here.
Good, good, good, good, good.
Yay, okay!
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
How about 600 and these earrings?
Sorry.
What? What's what you were afraid of?
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
Hi mum, put her back on!
Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... Phoebe's totally ruined that for me...
It... You can so totally tell.
Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
Ah, so what are we looking at?
Sorry.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
That is the sweetest thing, I just....
What?
Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
Really?
Here. I thought you might be cold.
Oh, hi.
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
Oh!! Shrimp toast!
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
Rachel!!!
Hey, they were popular when I left!
Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync.
Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
Okay!
This is how I would hold a football.
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
I'm really gonna miss you.
I'd need an expense account.
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
That's true.
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
"Yeah. That works for me."
"Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?"
I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
...if you tell me, I might do it.
What?
Ok. Thank you for coming with me today.
Sure!
Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
Oh, major shampoo explosion!
Well, there's two spots left right?
Yeah I know.
Just give us our apartment back!
All right!
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
What?
Call her! Call her now!
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
And I also brought my friend Joey...
Oh, hi.
Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"!
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
you don't have insurance?
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
No. Rosita does not move.
All right, then you owe me $350.
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Thanks!
Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart...
So, um, will you bring the truck?
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
All right, everybody open them!
Well, at least that's a great suit.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Why did you do that?
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
Here he comes! Hurry!
You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
You will?!
Get your hands out of there! No!
Show them to me!
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
Hey, Mon.
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
We are so gonna find them this year.
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
Who ? Joey: Me.
That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
Amy! Yes I do.. I really do.
Oh she's precious. Do you ever worry she's going to get your real nose?
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
Okay, that we may be able to do.
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Hello? Who are we spying on?
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
What? What?
Well now it's an empty bar.
Open bar!
Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
It was Jones.
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Hi, and I am also Emma's mother.
How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that'smy roommate, Rachel.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Yeah?
Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?
Oh my God! He did it?
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
I am. Let me just get my coat.
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
What if she jumped out the bassinet?
I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y...you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.
That is neither here nor there.
That's what?!
Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
What?!
Well those are very popular frames.
Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about.
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
Okay uh, however...
No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
Somebody got in late last night.
Hey.
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Grammy, Best New Artist.
What award are you practicing for?
Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
Have you ever been with a woman?
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Okay.
To get you to make out with him!!!
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Oh Fonzie.
Can you come here with me for a minute?
Yeah?
Are you seein her again tonight?
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
I say 'cheesy line', but ok.
Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
I know. It seems smaller somehow.
Wow.
You know, he was just doing his job...
Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
No don't! Go back to repeating!
Damnit!
Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
So were you guys together a long time?
Thanks.
Aah! Why? What are these for?
Rachel, this is yours.
Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-
Oh, good.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
Ooh, God it looks bad.
So, will I like any of these guys?
Wherever! I've got like 20!
Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
Okay, shoot!
He's perfect, he's never been better.
How's my little boy?
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Okay, calm down, here they are.
Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
You took the same class twice.
Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
What a tool!
You are so just doing this out of spite.
Small...
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Rach, here's your mail.
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
I'm sorry. See ya.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
Ohhh.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
It must take you forever to find your keys.
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! Huh?!
We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
That really is something; that's really cool.
Yeah!
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
I am so jealous.
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
You're kidding! Where? Where?
Uh, we are here to break up with you.
Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
Wow! If only more people knew.
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Not bad.
Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.
Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
You still love me.
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Do you even know who Kip is?
Hey, you're not Kip!
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Sure! God, please take those off!
Great! Thanks, Rach!
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
So?
The meeting with the guy went great?
Ooh! Brian's Song!
Ah, did I leave the stove on?
Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Um, I'm not.
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Thanks Phoebe!
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Morning!
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
Oh, no!
How could you not tell me you worked here?
How can you come here?
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Hey!
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
Yeah...
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Cat!
N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
Aw ... what?
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
I'm never gonna find love again.
You promised you would break up with her!
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
You called Animal Control?
Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Do you even know what a vicar is?
The vicar!
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Rachel! What are you doing here?
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
No way. No way did you do this.
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Why on earth would I understand this?
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
Hang in there. You hang in there.
Yeah, all right, it's a date.
Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...
All right. What's your news, Amy?
No, I was talking about your bedding.
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Hey, how you doin'?
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Go ahead.
You too. Last night was just wonderful.
Morning.
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
Hi!
So did you read your evaluation yet?
Mm! Night Gar'!
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
How-how did you lose your job here?
Wow! That is a bad audition.
Oh we just put her down for a nap.
Hey. Hey where's the baby?
Then, you will definitely get him back!
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
That.
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
You practice losing the Grammies too?
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
Hey!
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
Hi.
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
But I made cards!!
Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
Okay.
What am I making him by the way?
Um-hmm.
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
Some uh, some visual aides.
Thank you!
Did you at least win the contest?
No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Oh.
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya.
Ross? Can we just close the door?
Ross?
Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
But he's the same.
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
So, whaddya think George is like?
Shut up!
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
No more jam?!
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Don't do that.
Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Oh, that's Ross's.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
Oh, that's great.
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
You are a frightening, frightening man.
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
All right, I'm gonna go!
They had to have that specially made?!
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
I *love* my job.
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Oh God!
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
W-What are you, what are you talking about?
I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
Well, he stabbed me first!!
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
I know. My arm is killing me.
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
No no no, go-
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Wow! What an unusual cat!
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Yes, it was!
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
Oh, hello Rachel.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
Um, what- what would make you think that?
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Can I please be there when you tell her?
I don't think so.
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
I can hear traffic and birds! I can hear the voices in my head again! I'm kidding.
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
No! No, you know what? You , the baby's fine, now squam . Yeah, story walking.
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
Oh damnit!
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
DANGER!!!!!
Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener!!!
You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
It's his dad.
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Alright, have a good time.
Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
Sorry.
You need to learn some new slang.
No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red.
Well then why did you give me a ring?
Actually, technically, I didn't.
Ish. I just don't think I can bear it.
Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso was a terror.
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
Why does it matter so much to you?!
But why does it even matter?!
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
There it is.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.
Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision.
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
Okay.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Grazie.
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized...
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Rachel, that's all we do.
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
How is you drinking helping the kids?
I'm just helping the kids!
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
Hair Straightener?
You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Here, here!
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
Why, when did you get out of the game?
I've gotta get back in the game.
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Any luck?
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
Hey.
Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
Oh yeah!
I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Which one?
Aw what are you?! A detective?
Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
Babies don't care if they're slim.
Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...
At his apartment. Is this juice?
Where?
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
What...that scene I saw was so good!
Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
What? You just click when they click.
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
And you're no friend to those with noses.
Rachel.
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Ohhh!
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
What's the matter?
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Oh! Oh, I love that but.
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
I'll get back to my new job.
Have you ever seen so much crap?
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Oh my God. What happened?
Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Absolutely, yeah!
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Beautiful!
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
What's the part, Anti-man?
Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
Yeah, me too.
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Uhh, Rachel, my parents...
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
Yay!!
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
You changed?
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Umm?
Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.
I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young...
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
If we broke up, and I lost you...
I know.
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
Oh!!
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
Oh.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Neither.
I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
Really? You're moving on from Ross?
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
Nah, I got it.
Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
Yes, yes, that's right...
Oh my god, I left the water running.
Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
What for?
Guess who we ran into today?!
Hey! Ah!!
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Sweetie, now I pick you.
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Let's get the show on it!
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
That's right! You do what the hand says!
I'll take care of it.
That yeti is one smooth talker.
How did that happen?
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Let me see. Oh, right.
Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
Hi!
There isn't. There is totally isn't.
So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...
Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?
Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
They published my paper.
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
Not really.
I tried! They won't take her back.
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Not yet.
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
I need to get some Richard.
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
Uhm... Stockholm.
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
We should help him!
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Okay. Umm...
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
You really think so?
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Is it dry in here?
Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Estelle said I didn't get it.
Not unless different means the same.
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Hey.
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars.
Excuse me.
Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
Chandler, sense the tone!!
Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
Thank you.
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
How could you have told her?
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
No.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Wh-wh-why?!
Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
Wo-ish.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight?
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Work on your music?
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.
I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
He's coming over! He's coming over!
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Why are you taking this away from me?
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
I can't believe that didn't work!
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
So do you think that my dream means anything?
Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important.
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
This is it! This is my category.
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
Nobody, forget it! Rachel: Maybe.
Who do you wanna fool around with?
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
You have been maid of honor before?!!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Rach, these are for you.
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
What?!
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Well there's not much we can do.
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
I know!
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Hi honey, how did it go?
Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
Well, just buy the damn boat!
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
I'm done.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Oh, that's me.
I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Hmmm... Me too...
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
I love ya.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?
Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
You like me?
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Yeah.
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
Really? Well, in that case...
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
Uh-hmm.
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Hey. Morning, dear.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Hey! What's going on?
Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!
What?
Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
Who do you think its from?
Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
32.
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is...
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
No.
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.
A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
Me too!
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
I-I-am-
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
Weird, weird.
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
Here you go.
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Go!!
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
Oh.
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Okay. Sure.
No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there.
Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!
Oh God. It seems like forever ago.
Oh God. Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
Ass and face.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
You're gonna do it?
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
Deal!
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Got a job on a river boat?
Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
Bye you.
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Uh, boat rope.
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
I know. I just can't find...
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
Because it's my apartment!
What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
What? Oh my God!
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Also large?
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Okay so listen I'm gonna go lay down.
Thankfully you don't need me at all so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let's give it six to eight months .
Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
uh uh!
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
Somebody called about a monkey?
No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
What did I just say?
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
...Yeah?
There were times when it wasn't even me.
What?
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
What's goin' on?
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Oh yeah right!
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
Um, cake.
And ya know what, now I've got closure.
Good.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
This time it's not so funny.
God how long do you think that's gonna last?
Wow, he's really not letting this go, is he?
Ehhh, aw! . Well, that's new!
just... don't talk...
Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
Hey, Rach, how's it going?
All right, well how much time do you need?
Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
So, what? That's it?
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Thank you.
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Phoebe, Ross sucks!
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
Well-Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Thank you. We both forgive you.
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
Come here.
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
No, no, I don't.
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
And he's, he's a total stranger?
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
Is that Mark?
You put holes in my baby's ears!
You're kicking me out?
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Okay. Sorry.
You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
I don't know what to say.
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
Well you can split it with another credit card.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Because they'll know we've been listening.
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
Here goes...
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?
Bye dad.
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
Hey!
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
As in Rosita does not move.
Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know.
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
You don't have any stuff.
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
No! You should've read it yourself!
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Are you serious?
Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
Sure, okay.
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Thanks. I think you got it!
We got locked out of the apartment, we ...
I'm so sorry ...
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
You're not going to go.
Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...
Not really.
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over...
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
There you go!!
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
So-Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
Hey!
Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
Yeah.
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Because it's too delicious.
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
Burning's good.
Do you got your gracious loser face?
Yeah, I got my speech!
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
Oh. Should we send them something back?
Excuse me. Um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Are these the shoes?
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
What are you guys gonna do?
Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
What?
And you were at this job for four years?
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
You can have the last piece, if you want.
Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
I know.
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
I just did them.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Nope.
Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
Okay!
No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
Yes, yes!
I'm the hell person whose office this is!
Who the hell are you?
Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
Are we ready to order?
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!
Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!
Well, because of us! Because of our history.
Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
What's the thing you know?
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
I feel terrible, I really do.
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
Your license?
Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Aww, man!
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
Oww!
Why do men keep talking to me like this?
So, you're saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
Um-um, um-um.
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Take the bra off.
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
Take care.
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
No kidding?
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
You think so too?
I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Why are we in bed together?
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
What?!
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!
Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
Hey.
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Really? A purse?
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
Hey!
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Oh, yeah!
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
She's doing it Look, she's breast-feeding look!
What?
How come we have one extra place setting?
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
Need uh, need a little hand there.
Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
Hey!
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't...
Sweep, sweep....
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in!
Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.
Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna...
Oh you don't have to be sorry. I'm...I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't...picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh...kiss good-bye? No? Okay.
Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.
Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.
Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Eeaagh!
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
Okay. You too. And I hope you score. Bye.
Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun.
Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff.
You ah, wanted to see me?
Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up .
It's not a word!
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
I'm sorry!
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Just being friendly.
Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Well, I'm there too!
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
No, never done that either.
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Yeah?
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Yeah, maybe.
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Great! Roomie!
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Oh, from who?
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
You are the official baby crier stopper!
Yes I did, I'm Monica, Super Aunt.
See? I've even called Animal Control!
Animal Control.
Your agent called. You got that audition.
I don't know, but it sounds great.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Fine, I'll go call her.
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.
Who did?
Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
Oh. Oh.
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
So, how ya doin?
Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
Oh. Oh-oh.
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
Because it's my apartment!
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
So?
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
No! I went with Mindy.
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
Hey!
...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin.
I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
What? Nothing.
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
Hey, this- Heyy...
Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
So we're a little late.
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
It should be right next to my plane ticket.
Where's your passport?
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Okay.
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
Okay.
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
I don't know what else to say.
The job is in Paris. FADE OUT.
You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Why would I have the keys?
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Yeah I did!
Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
It starts?
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
We're hanging out.
We ended up having sex in his chair.
Uh huh.
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
I love Jacques Cousteau!
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
These are from Halloween three years ago.
Look at this.
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together.
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Eww!
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
You're weird today. Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
Hey, thanks for talking to me.
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Look I told you...
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
You know, I think I might just.
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
No, but it's-it's-it's hot!
Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different. Joey: Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
Vomiting stories are funny...
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
Good morning!
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so...
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Hey!
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Hey!
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?
Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... Only... only not creepy.
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! Wow! You remember Joey?
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or...
Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
Who else?
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Hey! How'd the interview go?
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!
Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
She's a waitress.
It's a standard issue bra clasp!
I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Comin' through. Move, move.
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Thunder being stolen!!
Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
I know!
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful.
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!
Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Noooo.
Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Good plan.
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Uhh, you said there was a party.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
Relax, I'll fix it.
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
Heeeeey, where have you been? What happened to you?
Hey.
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
Not Joey.
Can you please, please take care of it for me?
Rach we have a code brown situation.
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
You just wanna each take one?
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Rach...
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
Green. To the green.
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
I can't believe you guys went for that one!
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
Nope! Something else.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
I thought it was $98.50.
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Yeah.
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
What? Is it my breath?
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
That is not true!
Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
But people that you don't know and will never see again.
I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Wow, that's-that's-that's incredible.
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
"Thanks."
But can it... just... happen a little bit?
No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Fine. I'll go.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
Remember when we were in high school together?
Got me.
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Really?! We are?
No, she was just much better at job than me!
Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it.
Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word.
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
With a man?
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
Hi!
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
Uhh, rub it?
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Yeah.
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Surprise!!
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
Hmm?
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
NO!!!
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th.
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
You were at the coffeehouse!
Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
Hey!
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
You two were married?!
Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
Ok...
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
I got itI'm getting it!
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Yes, exactly!
I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Why?
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
Dealer takes two. What do you bet?
One.
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Hello, is Ross there?
But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
I really do.
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.
You've had feelings for me?
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
Bummer.
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Hi!
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Rachel, how did this happen?
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Oh, women can. You can't.
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Check out the ring.
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
What? What?
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
Which one is Gina?
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
What's wrong?
So, does this come in another color or...
I own this store.
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!
Gloves?
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Morning, roomie!
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
Ni-chou chi-ma!
You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
Uh.. To name a few. You know.. You know.. You've just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.
Clever. So how are you?
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Hey!
That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
What happened?
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
You have other friends?
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
I gave you one job!
Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.
All right! Well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?
Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Mmmm, no.
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
Big time!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Hey, my Father's house does that!
Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Hey!
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
You look pretty tonight.
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle.
Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
Come on, lottery!!
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
What are you doing?
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Ew-eww!! Undies!
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
Well, yeah.
Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
So umm, where are the other guys?
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
They know you know.
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
Hi!
Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed.
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
Is-isn't it the best?
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
Okay.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Is there? Is there someone else?
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it.
What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
Okay, you're on.
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
What are you talking about?
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Hi, I'm Joshua.
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.
Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
Yeah. How 'bout that.
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. Hmmmm... raunchy!
Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Yeah? Why?
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
The big book of childrens' names.
Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing.
Huh.
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
You didn't read this one either?!
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
Oh, of course...
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Five.
Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
Thank you.
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Don't do it.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Hi.
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?

He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
Isn't he great?
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Right.
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
RACHEL!!
Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
No.
OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
I bet two dollars.
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
It's the museum again, can I, oh.
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
There is a hardware store right down the street?
The hardware store is right down the street.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Yeah.
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
A moustache comb.
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
Yeah, he had a paper route.
And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Kate Miller it is.
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
Why? Because of the government.
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
Rach!
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
Oh!
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
Thanks for your help.
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
I used to wet my bed.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Air hole! Air hole!!
This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
Frank Jr. Jr.!!
Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... Okay, bye bye. She was nice!
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
That's great. Thanks Rach.
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
Also so gay!
Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Hey!
Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know guys do that.
: Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room and I caught him molesting himself.
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
Okay.
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
I am. I'm that stupid.
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
Twenty percent.
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Okay.
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Wow!
I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
Wait, he's not here yet.
yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
: Eww are you talking about my bother.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
Hey.
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
What?
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
What are you doing?
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
That is incredible! You are the master!
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Okay, I'll go!
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
DANGER!!!!
Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Hi.
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Thanks. What photo album was it?
Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!
Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?
Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Hey! What's up?
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
You wanna make it 6?!
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
How are you?
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
Oh, yay!
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
Yeah.
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Oh.
Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
You like that? Let's take this into high gear.
Oh! yeah!
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Uh, yeah.
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
NO! Or, cut!You know, that's your call!
CUT!
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.
Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Rach? What are you doing?
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Go, go, go!
Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Hey.
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
Hello.
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
Oh yeah!
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
Now that Rachel's gone?
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
It's Monica, open up!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Yeah, I want my money back.
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
I've never done that.
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
Hello.
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I don't care!
You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
I'm not sure.
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
What?
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
Yes, you did! And don't you say, "No, I didn't!"
No, I didn't!
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Come on over here, sweetheart.
Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
Wow! Wow, You look . . . uh . . . It's just, ah . . . That dress . . . uh . . .
Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
Tips not included.
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
where were you standing?
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
This body?
Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Uh-huh, what?
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
So, all right.
No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
Where are you gettin' this?
Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
Oh, Ja! Ja!
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Then what's that big lump under your covers?
No, sorry haven't seen him.
Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.
She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
Is uh, is Monica here?
It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
Are you kidding me?!
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
How much did you pay for that?
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
I am.
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Right.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
A dollar?
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
Went out with Joey.
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Hello.
Well I just came... I just needed to tell you... Congratulations.
My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
I'm still on the set!
Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
And that's funny, why?
Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
Ok, great!
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
Yeah, sweetie.
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
Oh! That feels sooo good!
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Jack used to handle the finances!
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
Yeah! Yep.
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Hmm?
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
Oh, all right.
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
But...
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so...
Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. Okay.
1...2...3!
Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
What? What?
So uh...I guess we should...make it official huh?
Oh my God. Okay.
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
Okay.
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
That guy's still doing that?!
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
That's correct.
Your company has a fine foods division?
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
That's great! That's wonderful!
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
Rachel!
OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Yeah that's better than my way.
Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Yeah, that was an awesome day! Opening credits.
Right!"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
Can I do it to you?
Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
I don't know.
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Look, maybe we should go?
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
You can't!
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
Well, thank you for lunch.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Hey!!
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Yeah, I filled them out last night?
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Night.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
Rach, he's not an ex-con.
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Hey, where is everybody?
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Why?
Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
How was the pediatrician?
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
So, have you kids eaten yet?
Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
I - I can't believe I'm crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Just go get some! Go!
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
Then you should have said something before I met her.
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway.
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
It was fine.
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Gimme this.
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
Come on Rach, let's go.
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Yeah.
I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross's baby! It's-it's so inappropriate. No, it's worse than that. It's wrong. It's... It is bigger than mine!
Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
Well, maybe I can help.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!
So it's looks like we're the first ones here.
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
Yeah.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
Ah, I'm sorry.
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
Op! You're peeping!
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?
Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
All right, I'll do it.
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
I know.
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
I am sorry, I don't know, I am sorry, I don't know why I did that!
What's the matter?
Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
I'm gonna tell Mom.
Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
We were on a break!
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room.
And! Break!!
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
May I see your boarding pass?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
That true, I am flaky.
Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resume.
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Nooo, it wasn't.
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
Get out!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Oh my God!
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
That's cool. Cool.
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?
I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
I don't think she'd like that.
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
So did you ask him?
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Okay...
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
Well, I have huge news.
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
Alright.
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
May I help you?
Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
What are you smiling at?
I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Alright, fine. I'll call you back.
Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
It really was. You've learned some new moves!
Oh. This was amazing.
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
Hello?
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
You did it twice?
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
So, did I hear Poconos?
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
I gotta go.
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Hey!
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Yeah!
I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Oh THATS ME!
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
Why?!
Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
You told us both we could be in the wedding?
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Oh my-Oh good God!
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
Oh, like that's a word.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
You're good. These are not.
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
What do you got there?
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
No, I just, I fell down.
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Great.
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?
Okay.
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
I don't know.
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Yeah! That guy's all right!
Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
It is our first official date. Our first date.
What's tonight?
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
It's a diaper commercial.
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
Amazing... amazing.
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
How is that ever going to happen?!
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
We haven't eaten yet!
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Yeah, I-I really do. Hey! This-this was a gift?!
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Yes, good! Ok...
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Oh my god good?
Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
Hey you guys! Look what I just got.
Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
Not possible! She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Hey, thank you so much.
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Come on.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Hi.
Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
That's not fair! I can't do that.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
Oh, well thank you in advance.
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
We don't, really.
Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
So, Monica, what do you do?
All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
She seems really, really fun!
I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
Yeah. We have rat babies now.
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
That's what you say at the end of a date.
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Cage closed?
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Okay. Let's bring it in.
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Okay, who wore those?
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?
What?
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better.
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
I guessed 20,000!
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Helps a little.
Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
Ow! Ow!
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
They prefer it if I don't barter.
Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him...
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
You were just being so nice to him!
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Why would you want to do that?
Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you.
Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
I love you too. Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Oh, you're kidding.
Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
I'm just trying to help you, move on.
You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard! end.
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
How about, you're moving!!
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
You got a tattoo?
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
He does not look happy.
Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
Are you moving out?
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... I'm sorry...!
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play.
Say you're sorry.
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
What.
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
How, how, um how can you not be going?
well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?
: Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn!
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
The small one.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Many are scheduled to appear.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
C'mon, this is us.
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary.
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Hey!
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Ick, you were eavesdropping.
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
For what?
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
What, so what are you gonna tell him?
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?
Hey!
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
What, what are you laughing at?
oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
I Know!
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Hey!
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
I, I don't know.
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
I don't care, she slept with me.
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
How?
How does going to a strip club help him better?
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Yeah!
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.
Right.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
Y-sure!
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Ross!
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Yeah.
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
Ohh!
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys...
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
Hello "ja", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
Well, I was thinking...
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Uh-huh.
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Fine.
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
All right, come here!
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
Fighting?!
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Okay.
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
What?
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Good morning Rachel.
Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere.
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."
"Yeah." "Me too."
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
Yep?
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
What?! What?!
Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Ohh, I thought that you....
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Yeah!
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
What's goin' on?
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
I'd better get back to my desk.
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
Yes?
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
You like Joey?
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
What're you gonna do?
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
How do you think she's doing?
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Ohhhhh!
Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.
Yeah, he's done some amazing works.
Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Do you?
Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
Hey!
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
Well, what's the job?
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
Will you quit hoggin' it!
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
Come on!
Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?
She's out, I'm gonna take her home.
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
What!!?
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
Sure.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Ah, what good are you.
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Shut up!
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
Get the what?
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Just call me Paul.
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
They're not listening too me?
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.
Oh, absolutely!
Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
From... Cosmo??
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
Well, what period is it from?
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Hey so where's Ross?
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
You okay?
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
Ok.
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
What?!
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!

Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Thanks.
What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive.
Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
Here you are.
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
No. Really?
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Orange juice.
Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Hey!
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. "Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. Now, you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. No, don't sing along. Monica, Moncia, have a happy Hanukkah. Saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross. And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy! And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!" Happy holidays, everybody!
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Oh come on, not again.
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
It's my new apothecary table!
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question?
Hey, here you go.
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
It really was.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
What?
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
You kissed him?
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Thanks.
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Okay, bye-bye.
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Hey, come on in.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
No I didn't!
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Well, that could take a while.
No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
Honey, the question is...do you really want to marry Joey?
This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.
China patterns!!!!!
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
I am not!
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
It's Pam.
No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
There it is, you're blushing!
I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
I will. Ross, come here.
Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry...
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Did you two...
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Oh, hey!
Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
What's wrong?
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Hey, what's this?
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
No I don't.
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
What?
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Okay.
Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
OK. Oh, oh, oh.
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
This is a great picture.
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
What you don't think I'd go up to her?
I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Yeah! But you said not to worry about...
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Yeah.
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!
. Good choice Ross.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Okay, quick and painful.
So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
No! I'm not okay!
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Ross? What's with the neck?
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Maybe on some level.
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
Ohh!
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
You're welcome.
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
It's Danny.
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
But...
Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Ok... so... Goodbye.
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
What?
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
I'm here.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
You mean, we-you and me?
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
What do you mean?
Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
I know but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
Rach, she's got like three hairs!
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Hey Rachel.
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
Ow!
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
That's great! I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
You wanna go down to the office right now?
Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.
Thanks for being born.
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Just, y'know out.
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Hey.
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
What?
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Mon?
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
That'd be great, thanks.
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
I-I-I-I did?
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
I don't know.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
Ohhh! Kids!
Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.
Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
I'll do it!
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Oh, okay.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
That was gonna be my opener.
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
Thank you.
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
I'm in.
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
Then you're not invited.
Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it.
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
Hiya.
Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
Seriously... What is it?
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
Did I, did I even treat?
Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
I think she looks cute. ... but I am wrong!
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
What?
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
Well, what happened?
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
Still thinking about it huh?
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Tell me about it!
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Why to save your dignity my man.
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
Why is it inside out?!
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Oh.
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
What?
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Whose is it?
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Oh. And how was the date?
Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.
Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
Oh, good!
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
What?
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
Hey, it's my list.
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
Argue with that.
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Hey!
Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
Hey! Happy birthday ...
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!
Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
Well, it's better than us deciding.
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
Rach!
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Ohh, okay.
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Ohh. Ouch.
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Her ankle is what you're watching?
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Done.
All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
I'm sure he'll understand.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
What is going on here?
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
Rach?
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
Okay.
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
You had no relationship!!
Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
Alright, we'll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. Huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Hi Rachel.
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Yeah, I know!!!!
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
A little bit, yeah.
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
I don't know Rach.
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I...it's beautiful I love it!
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
And then he did.
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
Hey, Rach, how was work?
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Not even close.
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... What the hell is my problem? OH!
No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through .
Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
All right, maybe it means that too...
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Turns out he is kinda funny.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Tell it again. Seriously.
I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
You okay?
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
Nope.
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Yeah!
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
And what will that be on the side of?
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.
Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?
Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it.
Thank you!
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
What? What?
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
What?
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
Ahhh!
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Well ah, actually...
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!!
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Your chair?!
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Which ones?
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
Yeah!
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
I know. I like it up here.
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Ohh, I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
Nana is on the phone.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Nothing, why?
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Congratulations.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
So?
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Not in my head.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Hello?
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
Men. I guy I know.
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
If this is your idea of sexy talk?
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
Hey, I forgot my scarf.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
You okay?
Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
Sure what kind?
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
No?
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
Ok.
Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
Hey!
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
Whoa! Don't know about that.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!
Ok, then, why are you... all dressed up??
Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross.
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Yeah?
I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse.
Bye. Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
I am so sorry.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
Surely you can think of something good.
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
Chicken? Chicken boy!
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
I'm just trying to spice it up!
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love".
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
That's no problem.
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?
Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
I like although!
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I...I really miss downstairs.
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
Is-is he ok?
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.
No-o-o! No way!
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?
Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
What is with your nose?
Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
Take care.
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Surprise!
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...
Oh!
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Yeah?
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh...
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
No!
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Ready? Wrestle!
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
What do you think?
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
I feel great. In fact! What?
Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
I'm sorry, what?
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
What? What?
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
Hey, what happened to you?
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Really.
They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, you don't.
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Uh--
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Why are you yelling?
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
Congratulations.
Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
A-a-and... record.
NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
Well, but, but. . .
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Hey! How'd it go?
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Hey!
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Sure.
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Yeah!
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
You know, I'm always right about these things.
Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security.
I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
I can give it a shot.
No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.
You said two weeks.
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
All right, so let's switch.
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Y'know-thanks!
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
Good morning.
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
Look uh, if we're gonna do this...
N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.
And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Are you serious?
Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
We're sorry.
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Oh my God!
Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
What's happenin'?
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
I don't know Rachel, why?
Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Surprise.
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
And chili!
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Uh-oh, busted!
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
Yes.
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
But we do! It's gonna be ok, Rach!
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Oh, I know...
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Hmm.
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
What's the charity?
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Well, the duck...
Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
What's wrong? Are you okay?
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
Someone like an...angel?
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Go on.
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Just please stop!
Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
How do you know she's gonna start talking?
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
What's up?
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
Yeah, you never heard of them?
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Your make-up!
Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game.
Hey! I sold that to Joey.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
And we didn't have sex.
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Excuse me?!
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
Well, I know what's the matter with me.
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Freedom!
With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
What do you need help for?
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
And so do I.
My father had an heart attack... ...while I was at Barney's.
No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.
I'm there!
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.
Great. So let's get going?
Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
So...I've never played that!
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Oh my God!
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
He asked you out?!
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
So you're going to give me the baby?
No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
No, that landed in your food!
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game.
You're all set.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
You must be Hilda.
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Me.
Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you.
What's up? You're voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Won't-won't that take longer?
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
What's going on?
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Ummmmmmmm, no.
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
How desperate am I?
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
See ya!
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
I didn't read it.
Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
Okay... Good luck.
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
Men are such idiots.
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
That-that's bad?
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Ok, careful, ok. Oh, she's smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!
Here we go!
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Huh.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
You really don't seem like you do. That's...
Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
Huh!
Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
You know it's me?
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Stay well.
Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not t-not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! Judy! Bye.
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
I make the decisions, and I say no.
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
She lets you borrow them.
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Well, the lighting was okay.
Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
Ok, hey Rach?
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
That's... that's classic.
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
When, when were you... under me?
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Great.
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
Daddy.
All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
Yeah!
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Phoebe.
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
I can show you an ID if you want?
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Hey, Chandler!
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
You guys ready fore the movies?
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
I can't say.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.
You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
Oh yeah.
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
Well, what do you do?
You guys, I'm doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.
Rach, try holding her a different way.
Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
Tell me about yourself, Zack!
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Oh.
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
Move!
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
Yeah?
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
Yeah.
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Did you just flick me?
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Erin! Still here!
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
There was never a good time.
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
Why not?!
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
There you go.
I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don't know what happened, I must be nervous!
Ok, so sorry.
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
What?
Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But um. . .
So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
That's what it seemed like.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
I don't think I should say.
Oh, I know... I still have my old key! We can just unlock the door.
Please let me stay on this side of the door.
Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
Hey.
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Yeah.
OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
Thank you.
What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
Right.
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Yeah right.
O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Yowzah!!!
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
That's your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.
Say what?
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
It's not bad.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
Oh good, you're all up.
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Yowsa!
OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !
Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
Ohh!
A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
Ok, let's work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe!
Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?
Oh, wish me luck!
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Uh-huh!
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.
Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Well it's not flexed right now!
Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
Yeah? Are you sure, really.
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
Yeah.
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
What?
Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?
Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda..... y'know.
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Vince is a fireman.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
Good night.
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Sure. Do you need some floss?
Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
We're teeth people Zack!
It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Nice try.
Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
Rach, there is a decent place to...
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Well someone does.
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Oh, great. This is just...
Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
What contracts?
Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
Yeah.
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
Goodnight.
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Still no luck.
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
What?
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Really?!
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
We?
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Oh, Very funny... Joey. Chandler: So, how did you enjoy the play?
Gotcha.
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Your own boat?
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
What is it?!
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Yeah.
Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...
Try to understand!
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
: Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
OK, here you go. Good luck.
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
Yeah. What are we gonna do?
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...
Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
What's the matter?
You know the book says that whenever she's sleeping I should be sleeping so...
What?
Oh, that's what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?
When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
What?
Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
Hey.
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
What did he say?
Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
I didn't order lemonade.
Well I can do whatever I want! I made her! Come on little girl, hi!
Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
No!
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Really? From who?
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
We just want you to think it through.
Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
Right.
Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
You're a pig. And you can't do this.
No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
That won't go with this dress though.
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Lucky sixes....
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
Well, I guess now we can't go.
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
I can't believe you married him.
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Miracle!
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
YOU KNOW?!!!
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
Thanks. Oh.
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
Put all my money in me.
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
Yeah...
Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
Really?
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.
Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Rach?
Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. .
Aren't you...?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Why? Did you write it?
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
You okay over there?
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
I'm still on "no."
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
Excuse me?
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Why would he turn off the TV?
Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
your ass?!?!?
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
I can't imagine why.
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
...And boogie!
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
What-what is it, what is it?
Uh... You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did.
Poor baby, you're so tired. Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you.
Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
Oh...
Yes, you did-Oh my God you didn't! Well then why didn't you tell me that before?!
No, I didn't!
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. Yes?
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
So?
And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
Exactly!
Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...
You're excited, right?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically...
Oh. Yeah?
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five.
Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Ohh, I don't think so.
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
What? Honey.
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
How could you lose him?
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
Hey, Rach!
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?
Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Ohh, what's wrong?!
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Do you want me to check again?
Ok Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. Alright! Lets do it!
Uh!
Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Damn! It's empty!
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
What happened?
Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.
Hi, hey.
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
You'd wait?
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car.
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Got me.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
All right.
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something-knock that door down!
Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
Yeah!
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
Huh?
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
Okay.
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
So ah, Monica ready yet?
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
So ah, what's wrong with him?
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?
And starting to think about settling down!
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
What?! Why?!
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds.
Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Let go!
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
Hey, someone order a coat?
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
No, I haven't seen him.
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
And you didn't marry him because...?
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
I can do that!
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
Better not be doin' these in order.
Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today, that's why I hung it on the door.
Yeaah.
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Yeah?
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
Yes.
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Yeah?
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Hello?
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
I'm so lucky I married you.
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Huh. Yeah?
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
No, I haven't.
Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.
I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Oh man.
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
Shh!
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Sure! It flushes it.
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Did you find the dress?
Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
But it's an original Buffay...
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
Madame, you must have your boarding pass..
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Um-hmm.
Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Wow!
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
Oh, God bless us, everyone.
Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
It does?
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Well, thanks anyway.
You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
JOEY!!!!!!
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
Uh, okay.
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.
So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
So?
No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so...
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Yeah.
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Mm.
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
I guess so.
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
You were supposed to tell her!
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
That doesn't seem fair.
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'
Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
I don't have to tell you everything!
I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
Where ya going?
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
What?
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
What did you say?!
Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Oh that's not true.
Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Oh yes, there you are.
Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino's.
Sure.
Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
Why does everyone keep saying that?
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
That oughta do it.
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Hey.
Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she's difficult, but I think it's really good that she's here.
Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I don't need that kind of talk in my house!
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
Okay!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Ok, that's me.
You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
He is the man in the black dress.
Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Hey!!
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Hummus. I got the hummus.
She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you.
What?
Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going .
I KNOW!
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Oh, I couldn't eat now.
No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Good for you.
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
No.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.
Good, because it's in ten minutes.
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Done.
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Well when can we have this shower?
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
Yeah.
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Well, you more then me, but he can't stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
Is he still mad at us?
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling 'Myron, get off!'
You slept out here?
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
But if...
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Already?!
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Oh, no thanks.
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
Well, you're not.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
I'll have whatever Christine is having.
Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.
Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
There's the man I married!!
Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
Sure!
Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
I'm good.
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
No, no!
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going.
Oh, what were the other two?
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Come on, Rach.
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
Oh no.
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
Okay.
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
Hey.
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!?
Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Y!
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
That was good.
I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
Hey!
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
I mean after tomorrow night.
Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Behind you?
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
Then uh, what's-what's this?
I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
Okay.
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
What about him?
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
No I left the diapers at the hospital! There's some in the bag but I'll run out and get some more.
Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
You don't have the guts.
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...
For what?
Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!
Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
Don't answer that.
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Ehh!!
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
For what?
Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Nope.
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
You got it.
No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
What are you doing here?
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
I didn't even think about that! Aaargh, sexual politics!!
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Why is it sick?
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
Eew! It's creepy looking!
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
Lots of responses.
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
You've seen all the movies...
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
These are her earrings.
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
What, that little thing at the prom?
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
Yeah.
Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?
Pants off Bing!
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
No, I hate cats.
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Now?
Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
Where is Emma?
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
What else do they add smell too?
Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
That bad?
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Ewww!
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Sure! Here.
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I'm gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?
Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
That's closer.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think they can come over here.
Oooh. Let's do. Let's send them mashed potatoes.
Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
Gladys?
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
You owe me a cat.
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
Oh-no.
Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Make the transfer!
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Uh-huh.
Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
How's your room Rach?
Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
We'll see.
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
Uhh-huh.
I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
Hey!
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Hey!
Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.
Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you?
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Rach, have you never done this before?
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
Come on.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
Ohh.
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Sorry I'm late, what's up?
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
That's great!
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
You're so bad!
All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
Be-caaauuuse...
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
No dear. It's not.
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
You got a job?
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Well, what was supposed to happen?
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Yeah! Rach?
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
What?
Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.
I love you too.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
Um... my... father.
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing.
Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
And she wants to go hunting, too!!
Ross, um, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge.
Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
Neither will I.
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
But you guys came so close.
Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Mmmmm.
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Hey, what's up?
I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
What do you think brought than on?
You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
Okay sorry, whew.
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
I'm not allowed to have soda.
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
Yeah.
Awe! Oh my God! Looks, she's a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?
See, I told you!
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Yeah, but that was different. Y'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird.
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, not the same thing.
I decorated Dad's office.
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
Good! Great! You can go first.
Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
Fine.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br...
Baby got back.
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
I think I'm gonna cry!
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
I'm sorry man.
Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
How do you fix the chair?
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
You have Knicks tickets?
Yeah I don't think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
You're just new at this, it'll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn't have been easy but you figured that out.
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
No! Coins hate me!
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
No!
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
All right, what's goin' on?
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
I can't do that.
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . "From Gavin"
Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
All right! I found one that fits!
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
And thank you, for that.
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
I know! I know!
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Come where?
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Okay.
Wha... My resume? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resume.
So... your resume is quite impressive.
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
There it is...
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
You and your ice.
Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!
Check your numbers! Make me rich!
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
What is she doing here?
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Okay.
Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
"Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking!
Oh god look at her sleeping. Oh, I love her so much! Oh, I think I'm gonna wake her up.
You know that's... that's her.
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night.
You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
Ross, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God! They put my baby's face on a penis!
Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
Yeah. Ross and Rachels Apartment.
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
What?
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line.
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
All right. All right, I'll do it.
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Rach, did you check the machine?
Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat".
It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
Ok.
Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.
So? What if they do?
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
What?! Over a stupid room!
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
Gotcha!!
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Oh, really?!
Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
Fifth day's a charm.
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
Me too. Rachel.
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
Thank goodness.
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Miss? May I help you?
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
They didn't fight a lot?
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Okay.
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
No.
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Okay.
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Are you talking about having sex?
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Huh?
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
That's it. That's my whole name.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
A what?
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Oh my God! How bad was it?
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
In Human Resources!!!!!!
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.
Oh right, right. So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
What?!
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?
You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
Huh?
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
Umm, no.
Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
You didn't like that?
Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
Hey!
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
Okay, hold on. Okay.
Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
Yeah.
Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
Hey, I was looking out for you.
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Yeah?
Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?
I was saving you.
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.
listen to this... I went out with this girl last night and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
You talked to her?
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Yeah!
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
"Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?"
"Yeah." "Me neither."
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there.
You never cooked since 1996.
God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.
Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?
Yeah.
I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
What, uh... what were you thinking?
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
Alright, but you have to do one sometime.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Yeah.
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
All right, let's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
O K.
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
No. Ross: Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? Ross: I'm smarter than him!
And I can't stop you.
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
You sick bastards!
I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.
Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in the hospital when I was getting my lips done.
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
Hey!
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Then I got all needy and clingy.
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
It's not a club.
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
I can't believe you bought this.
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
Yeah!!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
You're on the phone!
Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
Hi.
See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?
You don't mind? Well, what do you know, it fits!
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
Hi.
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
Umm...
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY!! HI!
I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
Miss? Please, sit down!
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
May I help you?
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . .
Oooh. Girl's night out indeed.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
Something to remember me by!
I know, I know, and you were right Ross. You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
Did she do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
Rachel didn't you just light that?
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Well, those were seals, man.
Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
You can't marry him!
Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
Sure, you want to go upstairs?
Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin.
I heard you were sick...
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
That's the surprise!
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
You're alone.
Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Oh, oh, good.
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
I swear you said you had the keys.
OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Good luck!
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.
Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
Pssst...
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
Excuse me?
OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
Yeah...
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
500 bucks at a flea market?!
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
Thank you. I'm from New York.
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. Look Emma, look who's baaack!
Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.

No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
Zelner.
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
I would never do that!
Mira, Mira, el viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop!
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
Is there a problem?
Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
Okay, why are you here?
Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...
Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who's ass I cannot kick.
Chuck Woolery?
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly?
Oh, my!
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
London is stupid! Stupid!
I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!
Hi.
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
That's insurance fraud.
Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
No, I'm-I'm serious!
Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can't even comfort my own baby! I'm the worst mother ever!
Shh! Nothing works with this child!
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
What?
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Well, like father, like son.
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Fish!
That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?
Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. But then, Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin!
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Like this.
Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
That guy, he burns me up.
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
So-so there is no party.
No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
Good for you!!
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
That is what the thing is.
No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
So, I'll get-get back to my friend.
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
You did?
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
OK, this one right here is from me.
Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.
I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other.
: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
Oh, how well you know me...
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
Go ahead.
Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
Uh-hmm.
Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
Good, you don't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.
Okay, that doesn't sound good.
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Yeah.
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
I don't know.
GIVE ME THE BOOK! Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
I would, but you're the last one.
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
What's up?
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
You could?
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
No. A break from us.
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
What?
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
Uh-Huh, Which is...?
Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.
Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do. Joey: I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
What?
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
Never call me from that phone.
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Oh well, well thank you. Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened, that happened.
Well, well, they're good. It's been a while since I've seen you like this. You, you clean up good.
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
All right.
Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
I'm sorry.
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
And there's daddy!
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
About what?
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
Did you go home and change?
You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Yes I would.
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone.
Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
I can't believe this!
Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... Hey!
So where are you applying to?
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Only way to fly.
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
She has to know that your not ready.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
Hey!
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Your sister Joan is crazy.
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
I sure do! And you don't get one!
But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
Ok, here, here. There we go.
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!
Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.
All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.
No, you don't.
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Hey.
Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
Is this true?
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Yes it's true.
I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
It's uh, right through there.
Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.
Why can't you ever be supportive?
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!
I thought you hated him?
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I...
So, system kinda broke down huh?!
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?
What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
What?
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
No. No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go. "Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."
What about Ross? What about your moment? Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
Yes, we are.
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
Yes, we were just...
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
You had a rough day, uh?
Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
Really?
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
She's not even cold yet!
I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
Congratulations!
Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
What? You mean behind my back?
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
Rachel.
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Oh, no!
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
...is for me not to see you anymore.
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
Why not?
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
So what'd he say?
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
Why are you so jealous of me?
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Water rules!
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it's just a little weird, it's you, and it's me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.
Rach, you sure you wanna do this?
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
I'm sure you're right, but why?
Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Really?!
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
I don't care.
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to...
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
I'm sorry?
That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
Look I was going to tell you!
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
oh! Now it's a party!
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Sharing is good.
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Sure.
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Yeah.
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
Honey, there's a reason.
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
What?
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
When's my daddy coming back?
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
Oh yeah!
Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that! Monica and Chandler's apartment.
Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won't do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
I don't get it, Chandler loved it!
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she's gonna go nuts for you.
Really?
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Are you sure?
Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
I know.
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Nope.
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Yeah? Sometimes it's...
Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will!
That's a huge thing!
Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
But...
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
Sexy?
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
Ohh.
So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
I have no idea.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.
I know what she's talking about.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Ow!!
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
How could I have left them in the copy room?
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
Well, where's the logic in that?!
Oh I'm sorry mummy's so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh. Shhh! Go back to sleep.
I can say I told you so but she's kinda doing that for me.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Oh, that's nice!
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
I gotta get the before shot!
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
That is so made up!
Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
Umm, a flea market?
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
Should I not have told you?
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
Really?
Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ready? .
I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
I could do that.
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
There's sooo much you don't know.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...
Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Ahh, miss? More coffee?
man sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.
: do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing.
I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...
Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .
Really? She... she loves me?
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
You need to get out of my chambers.
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
My God! What did you order?!
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
I'll talk to them!
Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department.
So glad you brought someone.
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... Joey, don't touch it!!
Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
It's not here.
Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Not a good day for birds...
Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby.
Why does she keep making that noise?
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!
Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!
Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.
Hello.
Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
That is a different phone.
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
You don't have it.
Oh that's so cute: Ross and Mike's first date. Is that going to be awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
To Ross.
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
You are totally jealous.
See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ...
Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
I was just leaving.
Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.
But hes falling in love with her.
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Oh. Aw, forget it.
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..
I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
No.
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
Maybe not.
When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
Yeah.
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
Oh my God, you look so good!
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...
Are you sure?
Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
The coins have finally forgiven me!
All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
Is this your first appology?
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
Nice.
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
No no no! Federal regulations!
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Umm-hmm.
Oh whose side are you on? I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.
Emma.
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.
What, Rach?
Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
Ooh, who's it for?
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
Oh that's great! You are the best!
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!
She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
You can?
Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...
Nice party.
Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
Now that's a thinker.
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
No, because you're not a grandmother!
Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
Oh... okay.
No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Naked alone time.
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
Madame, your passport please?
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
Actually, it wasn't that close.
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
So I nodded off a little.
Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Which one was Pete Carney?
No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
Is something wrong?
Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...
Hey!
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
No, no. I-I'm good.
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
Are you kidding?
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
Wh-why?
Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
Okay.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
How-how did that happen?
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
Hi.
Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through ...
Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.
Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
Are they here yet?
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
What's going on?
What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
Well, it's not.
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
He can have his job back.
Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
Hey.
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
I'm still right here!
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
OK, noone is named Sleeve.
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
Ok, dinner's on.
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!
Oh my God!
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
No, I had sex in high school.
We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
Hi.
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
Huh.
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
Thanks
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
Sure...
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important...
And a thousand dollars.
Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...
Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
"Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
Ooh, who's it for?
The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
Did you find it?
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
We have a winner!
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
What?
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Hey!
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!
I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
Le Poo's still alive?!
Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Because, I'm too afraid.
Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
How 'bout just a boom?
Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Really?
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
What's Emma doing today?
Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn't love. Do you remember Barry?
Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
Okay.
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
You're not gonna mess it up.
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
That's right.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great?
Wh... wh...what?
Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
Oh, sweety, you can't pull this off.
Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.
Chandler, control your woman!
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
Oh, how did it go?
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.
What the hell are you talking about??
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
Good.
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.
That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
Oh my God!
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
All right, that's it, I'm getting out of here.
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'
Nice uh, costume.
You are right there with Emily. And it's y'know, it's kinda like.... it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
Uh-huh.
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
It was ... oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.
Huh. What's Tag's last name?
I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
I can't believe you came back.
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
So was I.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
How did work go?
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Yesss?
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...
Yeah!!
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Nope! That never happened to me!
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiance and it was just sooo beautiful.
Is everything allright?
Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
I'm so confused!
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
Eh?
Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?
Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have always been jealous of me.
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
I can't believe it!
Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!
Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything.
What, what, wait a minute! You haven't even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, likean hour?
Ross, you didn't tell me you were a doctor!
What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
After one class? I don't think so.
And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
I missed you too.
Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
Um.. I'm a decorator.
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
That would be me.
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Hey!
Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
Hey, what's going on?
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
So how are things going with Paul?
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
It's my sister.
Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
Oh Drake.
Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this! Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair! And nothing with padlocks on it! .
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
In your mouth?!
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
And a glass of tepid water.
Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
Okay...
You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
I uhm... Well, I sang... well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back...
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
I... I don't know..
And y'know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8:30.
I love you.
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Man, do you know what guys want!
Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Oh, you weren't finished?
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
I did not!
Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know? I should just . . . move on with my life.
Better!
What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
What? May I?
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... a little bit more... a little bit more... There you go! Now throw it away!
How does this look?
Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! I'm not helping.
You said you'd marry Joey?
I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
What?
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Oh oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won't stop crying.
It worked!
"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
Oh, Chantal!
And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
Thanks.
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
Sure
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
You wanna fool around with Joey?
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
You want me to call her right now?
Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Hey, and then lunch.
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
Hi.
I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something...
He's totally flirting with you too.
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
What is it?
Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
I'm a little embarrassed.
But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
Oh, why?
Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
I'm feeling better.
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
I just, I thought Joey was there.
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Who the hell are all these people?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
Isn't it.
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
No! Why?
Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?
Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. Which one of us should go to dinner?
No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors.
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Och, god. Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.
'kay.
Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
What do you mean?
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
It's got 'em!
How was the honeymoon? Phoebe; Oh, incredible! Oh! Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic!
Hey! Hi!
I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
Yeah?
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
You don't know!
Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
I'll show you how.
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
When?
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Rachel?!
Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
Uhm, what was that?
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
Oh no, yeah.
Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.
Oh my God! I love things. What happened?
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
Yes, at 4:00.
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang "Su-Su-Suicide", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
What, what.
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
'Cause we will appreciate it more when she's gone?
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Wow, it's really long.
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Oh no! No! No! No!
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Who's that?
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Like what?
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
Look, are you gonna be ok?
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
Me too, we should get goin'.
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
Well, go ahead Rachel.
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Okay! "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time!
Yes!
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
For an emergency just like this.
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
Oh, I'm sure.
You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .
I know.
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing!
Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
Depends on what you mean by we.
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Just go over and say hi.
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
A kiss? What are you talking about?
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Well, that's cool. So did...
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?
What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.
Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Okay.
Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....
Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could share that with a guy.
And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Brides magazines?
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
It looks like a women's purse.
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Oh look, she's pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that.
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
Now I do.
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
Wooooo!!!!
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
I'm telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
I just can't see Chandler cheating!
Yeah... ....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
The guy with the gas?!
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
What if you put them here.
Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
My fajitas!!
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
What?
Oh, yeah. Joey doesn't share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
What? You know about the plate thing?
Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
And that's, that's funny why?
Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Duh, where've you been?
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Yes.
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?
Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... There's no guy in there!
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Something else I might have said?
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
Knock-knock.
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Sounds like a fun party.
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
FINE BY ME!!
Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.
Okay, from the top, people!
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you?
Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
Technically, huh, no.
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
Hey, look who's up.
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air...
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
Are you jealous?
Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
How did you get in here?
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Oh, no problem.
Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. That's not nonchalant!
Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
I suppose.
So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
Like a goalie, right?
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...
This stuff is great!
Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
What, it's not your fault.
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
Hey.
'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
Do I?
Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much Oh don't cover its ears! It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
... she's being unreasonable!
Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.
I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
Any luck?
See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.
I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die and I don't get your baby?
Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
Okay, that was Mike.
Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.
Bye.
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
Oh my God!!
I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
Really? Wh-what's wrong?
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
We didn't order cake.
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
Ok! Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
Ok, what is this?
Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
Now, what is this?
I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
I'm talkin'!
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
What are you writing?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
You think?
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Oh, is there a problem?
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Rachel?!
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
Yeah.
Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...
Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
No.
Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
Hey.
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesn't make sense anymore.
Uh, clearly.
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
Sorry.
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
That's kinda sad.
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
Uh-huh, that one!
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! And it's out of my system!
Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Twenty-four actually.
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
I can't believe she cracked your code!
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.
I'm just going to need to see your passport.
Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Why do you care so much anyway?
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
Yeah?
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."
Marenge,
Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
What?
Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I'm... I'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
I thought you said you read it in high school.
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
You don't think I know that!
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Does for me.
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
You owe me a waffle.
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Oh, I never could do it.
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
What?
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
Can I use.. either thumb?
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Why?
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
OK, that's my tattoo.
Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
You're nose is bleeding!
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
Yeah, we went shopping!
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
All right, you ready?
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you...
Hi!
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
Let it be me! Let it be me!
It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
I am soo dead.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?...
What the hell are you doin'???
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
My what?
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
Definitely!
Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.
Ready for your birthday lunch?
Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!
But it was a deap meaningful relationship.
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
I'm sorry?
Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
That's so gross!
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
Wha, uhh, what?
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
And deaf!
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
So now what's going on here?
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Oh, get out of here!
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Okay!
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
You're bleeding.
Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.
You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
Wow!
I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!
Why?
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
What?!
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
What's wrong with people having sex?
What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
No, I fold.
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o' clock. So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk... somebody here?
Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
I can't catch a break!
Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?
Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.
What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Can I see your license please?
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!
Wow, you're here already.
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
What happened?
...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
So tell me about this girl?
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
What about Julie?
No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.Gavin come out from behind that curtain!
There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.
Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... That ain't gonna happen.
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
What did Joey say? I like you back?
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Events from around the globe.
Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
Oo...what's in the bag?
Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...
No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!
And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
How was your date with Joey?
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
How to make the next one even shorter?
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
Hello!
That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Noo!
Oh Ah! Oh my gosh there's something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think... Oh you guys I love it.
Look at all the stuff people sent!
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.
So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
Morning!
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?
Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
Oh here's a whole bunch.
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Hey Rach!
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
Nooo!
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. Bye...
They left.
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
So.
Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!
Oh! trying on clothes.
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
Yeah, what's that like?
Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.
Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
So how's Mindy?
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Oh.
No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
Rachel, you and Mark?!
Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
Okay, who's next?
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
Why did they get divorced?
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Very!
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
What?
Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
Ahh, yes.
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
What?
Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
So you really OK about all this?
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Y'know what? You are right?!
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
What the hell are you doin'?
Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
They did?
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
That is lucky.
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
But equally real!
Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Hey. It happened!
No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter's birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!
I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!
Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
Huh?
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
...and this guy...
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.
Here, look, alright, does this help?
No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
No, but. . .
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
What's goin' on?
Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son.
Gavin Mitchelle's office.
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
Really?
Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Well, um . . . I don't know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah . . . little thing.
I know. So, what's going on with you and Ross?
Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.
Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.
All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
Are you all right?
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Still crying?
Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!
That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Yes.
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
Hey!
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Oh me too.
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
You don't think I'm cute?
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
It's not a cat!
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.
I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
How'd did it go?
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
Everybody!
Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Oh, hello Rachel.
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
Hm?
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
What?!
I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
Uh...well...just once...with you...
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass". Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.
Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
It's that terrible?
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
Yeah! You're the best!
Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up?
Hey Rachel!
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
You have some life here, sweetie.
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
I didn't realize that she was so close.
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
'Cause you guys were on a break.
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
How'd it go?
I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
What?
Y'know I can't even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can't believe how much I love her, I can't get enough of her, like right now I miss her. I actually miss her.
I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing really quickly.
God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
I'm gonna start getting ready!
What the... DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little!
A MONTH??
You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.
Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.
Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago. Man, I really bug you, don't I?
Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.
So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
I don't gossip!
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
I know honey, I'm sorry.
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
I thought it went very well.
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
Really?
That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
All right, I'll pick that one.
Hello. But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.
Good morning!
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
I'm right here!
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
What's hard to believe?
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Oh my God. I can't believe you live in that building. My grandmother lives in that building. Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kind of smells like chicken? Looks like a potato.
It's huge.
I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
I can scratch that right off.
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
That is damning evidence.
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
Will you call him?
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Oh, that poor bastard.
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a cafe, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I thought you should know.
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Remembered what?
Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. God! It's just such a magical time!
You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
I thought you didn't smoke.
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Ohh! That would be great.
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Remembered what?
Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us! But I can't do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!
I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!
Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
Nooo!
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
Uh-huh.
I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
Yeah, okay.
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
Oh my god.
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
Really? Like how?
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
Rachel has a new doll.
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
Okay.
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
You're not gonna be phased out!
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
Are you all right?
Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don't think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn't for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's ok.
Yeah, Monica made us!
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
Because then I don't have to!
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
We need more cards.
Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
And you're not gonna do that.
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
You have to respect the sea!
Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter? TV: "And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7"
Come on!!
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak.
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
C'mon! This looks good!
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Hey, hey, hey no.
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
No, I'm sorry.
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Normal.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks!
Seriously?
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
Ah! You know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.
: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
What?!
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
What?
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
That's a little clearer.
Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy.
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
Hopefully.
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
An advance?
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
Okay!
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
Yes!
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
It worked!
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
Damnit Phoebe!!
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
What?!
Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it! Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross: yeah thats a great idea!
Hey will you get me tickets too?
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
Oh.
Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!
Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going helicopter shopping.
What? Homo ergaster: Some scientists classify some African erectus specimens as belonging to a separate species, Homo ergaster, which differs from the Asian H. erectus fossils in some details of the skull .
I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. Or-or not!
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
Yeah, what' going on?
Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
So, this was uh, really fun.
But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
Yeah.
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
Huh.
Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that. Monica about to have a heart attack: Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.
No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.
All right. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!
Okay, good. Thank you. I'll be back shortly, all right?
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
Or facing a bitch of a commute.
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
So you hit her in the face?
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Huh?
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
Okay Ross! Please don't die!
OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
C'mon Rachel.
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
That, you get? That, you get?
No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
It's not a cat!
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Waitressing?
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
W-What was the one right before bananas?
Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
This is weird for me!
Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
Wow.
Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
What do you mean?
Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: "Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."
I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
I'll treat you real nice.
All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm just all over the place.
You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be arodeo clown.
Sometimes just nodding is ok. Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
Right!
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
What?! What would make you think that?
Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
Hi!
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
I guess so.
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
What do you mean?
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
So what happened?
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Good.
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
Okay.
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Yeah.
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
No, look, don't touch that!
So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
What big thing?
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Thanks.
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message.
I'm outa here.
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
Okay.
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
No, not my touchie.
...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater." Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Yeah, it is the best.
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
Hello? Hello?
Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"
Uh, you're not gonna win.
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
What?
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! They have to learn!
Rach, she's not going to remember this.
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Oh, really?
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
Why are you laughing?
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Oy.
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
And that's Pete's Mom.
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
No.
No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand.
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What's wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation theyAlways ask, "what, you live together but you're not a couple? And you have a baby, isn't that weird? And I say "No.You know what, it's not, because it works for us! But you know this doesn't work. In fact this is the opposite of working!
None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That's not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didn't tell anyone!
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
You would think.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Oh! That's nice.
Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
Really?
Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
Nooooo. You're really not going?
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
Oh.
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Go!
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
I don't think so dear.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
So what happened?
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Oh that's so sweet thanks.
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
Here let me...
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Then why did she ask us to...
Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!
Oh, it's perfect.
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
Okay, London 1...
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
Right! But, I am sorry.
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
Yeah?
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
Oh shut up!
What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
That's right.
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Yeah, you're funny.
Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.
He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
Okay then.
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
And then... your face is bloated?
You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
Hey, how you doin'?
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
Sure.
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy... Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody... I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo...
What are you guys doing? Oh my God, is that Richard?
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Fair enough.
