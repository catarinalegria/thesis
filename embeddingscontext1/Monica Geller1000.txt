I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.
Oh, you're a grandpa.
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
Yeah.
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Oh, I already have one.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Any time you're ready, Joey.
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Hey!
Hey, Pheebs!
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
No.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
So, that's it?
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
Why not her?
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
I wish all guys could be like him.
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Hi.
Hi.
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Come on! I really need your help!
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
I've got Ben.
Because, because I've got Ben.
He's at a dinner party.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
What?!
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Oh and you know what I want!
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
But I already gave them back to you!
No you didn't.
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
I know!!
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
They have the best stuff in there.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Oh?
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
I guess you can.
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Hey!
Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
What?!
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Oh my God!
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
-leg?
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
Yeah! Oh yes!
Ohh.
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Totally!
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Hey, it's good to see you!
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Well, my nose got lonely.
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Right.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
That's okay.
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
Is it true they have beer?
Everything you've heard is true.
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
Um
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
Yeah.
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
I don't know.
Me neither.
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Really?
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Uh-huh.
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
No-no, let me in!
Phoebe?
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
Nevermind.
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
Yeah, that's what I said.
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Whoa! Don't know about that.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
Thank you.
That's fine.
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
That bitch!
Monica! What...
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
It's Fun Bobby.
What, isn't he sober?
Ohhh, OK.
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
And cut!
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
You have no trouble telling time now right?
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Nooo...
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
Definitely her.
Yeah.
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
Are you really not going?
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
If you wanna call that a reason.
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
I know!
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Oh.
Huh!
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
What? That's like insanely easy!
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
I made you a surprise.
Oh yeah?
Did you not understand the story?
Hey!
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Monica Gellerrr.
Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
Just please stop!
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Would you excuse me for a second?
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
So it's okay to date a student.
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Okay!!
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Uh-huh, that one!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Your mother told you this?
Yes!
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
A mirror?
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Cache? Jaunty?
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Are you still awake?
Yeah! You?
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
You're not an artist.
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Pheebs, how's it going?
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Oh-I don't know.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Oh really?
Who is it?
Edward Nevski?
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
You were trying to eat it!
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
I can not believe your trading me!!
Are you gonna let me play?
All right then.
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
No, I think you should tell them.
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
Alright, shall we?
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Well, then can we meet him?
Nope. Schhorry.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Oh, that is so sick.
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Yeah.
What?
Umm, you've got some on your pants.
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Um-hmm.
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
What gave me away?
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
No.
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
Oh, yeah!
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
You're strict.
It's for their own good.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
Hey!
Hey.
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Really?
How about Mockolate mousse?
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Deal!
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
I'm sorry but...nothing.
What?
Honestly? Me too.
Really?
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
What are you doing?!
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
What the hell are doing?!!
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Half full of looooovvvvve.
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Mustached bastard...
Excuse me...
Good evening.
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
Oh.
Hey!
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
It was you?
Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Hi Chandler.
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Come on, we can't let them win!
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
Later!
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Yeah, it is the best.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Yeah, I can do that.
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
What a sweet story.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Really?
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Tell her what?
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Joan?
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Not broad backed!
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Hey, Mon, what is this?
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
How could you tell her?!
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
Phoebe, wait a minute!
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Even with me?
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Hey!
Nope.
No? What happened, big guy?
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
That-that's bad?
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Because we can remember them.
Well, sure, that too.
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
What?
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Yeah, you're on your own.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
Give me that.
OK.
Hey.
So uhh, how's the palace?
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
No! Oyster?
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
I do like that.
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
But you told them you weren't?
That's right.
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
I know a great little place.
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that.
Why, how much is that?
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Really?
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
Hey!
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Absolutely.
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
I was afraid of that.
Know what I mean?
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
Ahhh! Ooh, nice!
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
Oh my God!
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
You like it right?
Yeah, come here!
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Thanks.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
Hey.
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
You got it! Oh-oh!
What are you doing?!
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Do not speak ill of the dead.
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
What did you say?
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
I am!
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Yeah.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
The Ice Capades?
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
What?
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
They'll never understand!
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
I was in too much pain.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
I think he's shy.
Yeah?
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Happy birthday!!!
Happy birthday!!!
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
Waiting for candy.
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
We want candy! We want candy now!
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Oh, the mixed tape.
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
I'm starving!
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
Please! I made this game what it is.
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
What equity investments?
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
You don't even have a car!
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
Yeah, it sure is!
They have parasites?
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Hey, where is everybody?
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Okay.
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Oh right, right.
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
I'll have whatever Christine is having.
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
I love that idea!
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Aww.
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
What's that?
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
You're kidding! Where? Where?
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
Chandler! Chandler!
Hi.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
What?! I just touched him and he went over.
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
You used to have carpet.
Oh yeah!
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
What? What's wrong?
I, OK....
Alright.
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Joan?
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
Mockolate.
I'm sorry?
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Yeah?
Yeah!
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
I used to love to play restaurant.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
Just some stuff for the party.
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Oh honey, I'm sorry.
Ohh! That's so great!
I know!
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
All right, come here!
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Monica! Stop it!
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
Pete's breaking up with me.
What?!
And?
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Yeah, Ginger something.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Well, what did you do?
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
A test?!!
What are you doing?
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
I haven't seen him in so long!
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
It's almost as if he knew.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
I don't gossip!
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
What? They were like this!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Nothing.
Come on, tell me.
Oh, I promise, what.
It's Richard Burke.
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
All right.
Thank you!
It was, it was her voice.
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
Frozen lasagnas?
Um-hmm.
No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Okay, this one I like!
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
I know the code to his answering machine.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Must pee.
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
This is so much fun!
This is not fun!
Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Really?
So, Monica, what do you do?
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Yeah, that's true.
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
No. No, you're not a loser.
Look at me!
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
Well...
I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
You put your fist through the wall?
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Fine with me!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
Excuse me?!
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
There he is! There he is!
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
Who's this from?
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
I have some moves.
Yeah, let's just forget it.
What if I turn out the lights?
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Huh?
You said no right?!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
I know.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Hey, the man's dog just died.
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Uh, plate?
Plate! Yes, plate.
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
What?
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Yeah.
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Anybody gonna eat that?
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
I promise.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
Hey!
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Um, cake.
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
Bobby.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
And you?
I thought it was... quite tasty.
A bitch?
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Oh.
Yeah baby!
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
Not fun anymore?
I'm still hungry!
I am!
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
All right, so what were you thinking?
Ohh! No.
Why not?
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Really?
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
I know, it's great!
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
Hey, you're right.
Yeah.
Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Come on, they were not that huge.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
You or me?
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
You have dinosaur checks?
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
Hey, Mon, what is this?
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Still crying?
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
What's the other one?
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
Hey, Monica!
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Why?
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Was it not pain-free?
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
I can not believe your trading me!!
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
"See you around?"
Well, what do you want me to say?
Alright, I'll call you.
I don't think you mean that.
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
What?
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Oh, okay!
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
Ya think?
No, was he any good in it?
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
For what?
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
What, like a number?
Hey!
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
All right.
Hi.
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
Okay.
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
You need to give him money.
Give him money? It was a joke!
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
I want the little round waffles.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
We have got to wash that!
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Hey, you know about that?!
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Y'know, the possible side affects.
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Why?
In case it happens.
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
Can I use your phone?
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Maybe she never got your message.
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
What were you doing in Africa?
Working with blind kids.
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
Okay!
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
I'm sorry..
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Okay no, you do it.
What?
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
He does?
Say again?
Feelings, such strong feelings.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
That's me! Come on!
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
A face ass?
A chin dimple!
Have you seen your guy's body?
No, our guy is just a floating head.
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Like a pirate?!
If that helps you.
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
Gimme this.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
People! People say it! Come here!
So oysters, huh?
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
No.
Ahh.
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
Please.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Yeah.
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
Goodnight.
Mmm. Oh, no-
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Ok...ay.
I just had sex.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
You tired Chandler?
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Really?
All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
All right.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Thanks!
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Yes, it was!
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Why?
I have my reasons.
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
Wow... Wow!
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
Oh. Oh.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Flexible hours.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
He took my joke, he took it.
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
Just tell me the truth.
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
Where's that?
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Not any more.
Really?!
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
And did you?!
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Oh my God.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
No, not my touchie.
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Work on your music?
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Oh, you get used to it.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
For what?
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Thank you!
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Lebanon.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
I-kea! This is comfortable.
This place is amazing.
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
A test?!!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
Hey.
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Yeah?
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
Or so I would have you believe.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Lebanon.
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
But Mon, you have to get our money!
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
What?
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
It's me, Carl.
C'mon up.
Seven hundred bucks!
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
How?
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Keep going.
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Eh! There you go.
Oh, ew!
What?
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
Monica?
I guess that's how.
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Does that mean Carcass is available?
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
How?
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
Rachel always cries!
That's not true!
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Go!!
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Ohh, that is soo sad.
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
No, she'll yell at me again.
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Yeah, right. Sure!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
That is not true!
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Nice car!
Yeah, it's not mine.
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
You have got to go home!
But I like it here!
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Great!
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
I'm gonna set them to my time.
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
Keep talkin'.
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
Like a hound?
Not a basset, a bassinet.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
I'm sorry, who?
But we don't know the neighbors.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
He just said, "No strippers."
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Little village people.
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
Fine.
Sorry.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
See.
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
You are so smitten.
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Hey guys! Hey!
Hey.
That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Not at these prices.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
Get my glasses too.
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
What? I don't see anything.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
I'm just taking you outside!
Oh, okay.
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
You're so efficient. I love you!
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
It's almost as if he knew.
Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on.
Hi Emily!
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
What?! Ow!
Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Hey.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
That's not a question.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Ah!
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Oh, from who?
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Oh, why?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
That's not funny.
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Who is it?
It's me, Carl.
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Noooo.
What?!
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Yeah, I'd really like that.
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Ethan?
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Why haven't you told them?!
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
That was a terrible throw!!
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
Yeah, I think we are.
This isn't even my dress.
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
What is wrong with you?!!!
What?!
So you didn't mean any of that?!
No you robot!!
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
Sure.
Cassie?
Uh-hmm.
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
You let Joey drive it?!
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
So are you ok?
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
Yeah, well they suck too.
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Why not?
'Cause it's gross.
Really?!
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Good for you!
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Yes, but you are dead inside.
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
You don't even have a car!
And?
And six others.
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I do?
Okay.
Or not.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Hi!
Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
What happened to uh, MEG.?
That is so not my motto.
Hey.
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Yeah.
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
What are you doing out there?
I am, uh, I am...
Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.
No.
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
What's-what's the difference?
Hey, y'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
What did you do on yours?
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Says who? Your mom?
Yeah.
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
I spelled out boobies.
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
What?
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Huh!
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
You're not a senior?
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
And that's Phoebe over there!
Hi!
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
Not really.
Well there you have it!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
Yeah.
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
No.
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
I can hop.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Yeah.
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
What?!! What?
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Why not?!
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
Hi!
What-what are-what are these?
No-no-no, no!
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Hey! I call her!
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
No-no
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
How did that happen?!!
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
How did you make $17.
How come those?
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
How drunk are you?
That's the perfect amount!
Okay!
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
I get that a lot.
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
But we're not ready to tell yet!
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
I'm coming already!!
Jeez!
Hello, Chip.
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Don't say it.
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
I know that.
Hey!
Hello.
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
Huuh.
Well, didn't you?
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
No that made me feel precious.
Yeah? Sometimes it's...
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Okay!
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
About four hours.
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
Isn't that great?
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
That's excellent.
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
That's not possible!
Ow!
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
Hey
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
Uh, hello.
Hi.
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Yes but my mom got me this job.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
What are you doing with the lamp?
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
Wow! Skates!
Well...
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
What?!
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
Oh, well that's not so crazy.
I'm just easing you in.
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Yeah, okay.
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Who's Paul?
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
He finally asked you out?
Yes!
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
I'm not all right.
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Say that to him and you're golden.
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Why would they think they're invited?
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
Diane Keeton.
Do you realize you get louder each week?
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Sounds like a date to me.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
How did he do this?
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Hey, where you been?
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
I do not have baby fever!
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Uh-hmm.
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
Well, what did you do?
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
You gave her food poisoning!?
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
God. I feel violated.
Ross, ten o'clock.
Is it? Feels like two.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Yeah, I-I don't care.
Okay. I-I can't watch.
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
What? We could do it!
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
And that's Pete's Mom.
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
Noooo!!!!
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
Pheebs?
Huh?
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
So what's going on with you?
Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
What?!
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
Well you don't.
Yes I do!
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Really?
Well, it still has to go, right?
Why?
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Your mother told you this?
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Ohh! Really?!
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
But we don't know the neighbors.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Gooood morning!!
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
So how are you doing?
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Well, thanks, we like him.
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Uh, good.
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
What?
Bunny!
Thank you.
Monica, I'm your best friend.
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Oh.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
$4.50 please.
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
And could I get my ring back?
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
No-no, let me in!
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Yeah, that's true.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Ohh. Ouch.
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Since when?
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Who was it?
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Sure!
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Ross, can I?
The head, the head. You gotta...
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Mmm.
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
Really?
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
What?! Really?!
I can't believe this!
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Have you seen Chandler?
No. Why?
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Hey.
You're naked in this picture!
I know.
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
No! Drums!
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Yay!!
Oh, in that case--Yay! That was me hopping on board.
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
PBS Telethon.
Hi Joey.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Hi, oh hi.
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Look, it was a job all right?
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Oh! Him.
Oh. Whew!
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
And you knew about this?!
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Really?
But again, Simmons. Go on.
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
I'm crying here!!
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Of course!
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
...and live forever as a machine!
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
She's sleeping.
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
You get the dollhouse.
I get the dollhouse!
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
I, I, I'm hideous.
Come in.
Hey baby, I'm back...
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
So, this isn't over?
Really? Okay. Great!
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Sure.
Normally, I would not do it.
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Oh crap!
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
Oww!
What's the matter honey?
It starts?
Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
Whoo!
Cool.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
Yes.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
When did I say that?
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Hey! What's up?!
So all we have is ice?
See if he has ice.
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Yeah, isn't he?
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Whaddyou want?
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
That's not even a game!
What? Shut up! We're winning!
Fine, let's do it.
Oh, I have cards!
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
Hi, Alan.
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
C'mon!
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
How come?
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
To the Bings!
I'll do it.
Who wants it? Anybody?
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
Oh, an old glove?
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
I was just leaving.
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, Big Brother.
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Glass, sand, whatever.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Oh, I can still do that.
How are you still single?!
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
What?!
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
No, it's really good.
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
What?
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
I guess you can.
All right.
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
I'm with Hamilton!
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
I know, I can do this.
Ooh, and I can do this.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
How?
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
Yeah.
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
What?
Your nails.
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Unless...
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Noooo.
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Dr. Burke will see you know.
Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
Ready?
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Let them win one.
You're not even giving them a chance!
They have racquets don't they?!
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
Try the bottom one.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
Hey, look who's up.
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
What's the other one?
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Oh, we have some...
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
I can help with that.
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
It's the basketball playoffs.
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
She's right y'know.
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
I didn't think I was!
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
What 'cha doing Mon?
What are they?
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
So Santa's coming?
Yes! Santa's coming!
How do you know so much about this?
I don't know.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Monica, what are you doing?
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Would you please get some rest!
I'm fine.
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
But the mess!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Bobby.
Yeah, OK.
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
So, what are you saying now?
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
Thank you! Break!
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
How come those?
What happened to uh, MEG.?
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Ben, dinner!
Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
Noooo.
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Bye!
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Sixty guests.
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
I don't know.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
We ruined everything.
Ugh...
What do you, what do you mean?
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Where can I wash up?
Thank you.
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Pheebs, run!
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
That guy's still doing that?!
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
Wow, is that Michelle?
Yep.
Ya know, she's having another baby.
I thought she just had one.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
Ya know, the man's got a point.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
No I don't.
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
Sure. Yep.
Certainly.
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
What are you guys talking about?
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
But I love swing music!
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
What are you gonna do?
Rachel said that!
Well Rachel's not here!
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Yeah.
I wanna hear "The Sound."
Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
No, there's no dog here?
Oh my god! Where are you?
I'll be right there!
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
All right, be my guest.
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
I am so attracted to him right now.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Well, Joey's my best friend.
I'm not your best friend?
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
How have you never been on Oprah?
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
Oh, wait a minute honey.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
We said six!
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Hi!
Oh my good God.
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Uh-hmm.
I love you so much.
Oh yeah, totally!
Oh good.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
How can they do this to me?
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
G'night.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
Oh God.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
It's perfect.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
You sound like a guy.
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Let's do it!
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
I was tired!
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
It's Richard Burke.
Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Doctor Burke is sexy?
Oh God, absolutely.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Right here!
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Some moms do that.
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Yeah, okay.
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Well, they always called.
Hmm, bite me.
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Eh...
Okay well that's good to know.
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
That was you?
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
Hey, he's not crying.
Yes! There's still pie.
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Chandler!
Yeah.
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Okay, this one I like!
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Have at it.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
Umm, your boxes are umm...
What?
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
When did this happen?
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
So, are you gonna see him again?
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
What?
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
That sounds great!
Hey!
There's gravy?
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
I'm all better now.
I helped!
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
No because it-it didn't seem important.
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
Well, uh, he's a doctor.
A real doctor?
Well that's wonderful. . . I
Mom, it's OK.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
Get out, get out of my apartment.
Least of all you.
Why? What you'd do?
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Does anybody need anything?
That is so unfair.
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
We all hate Emily!
Nooo!!
Yeah!
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
Pizza?!
Monica!
No.
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
That, that's what's stupid.
Down at the docks again?
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
Oh, is he hungry already?
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Okay.
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Hah!
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
So we can be friends who sleep together.
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
Oh.
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Okay.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Oh, great. This is just...
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
Why, exactly?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
So, this isn't over?
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Yes!! Ohh.
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Okay!
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Okay!
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Oh my God! What happened?
Sixty guests.
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Well, he's very charming.
Well, you're just gonna have to try.
Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
What?
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Monica, leave him alone!
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
I don't know.
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
You said number two.
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
How?
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
So, that's it?
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
You keep saying that.
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Okay!
Okay.
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Yeah, that makes sense.
Over my dead body!
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
'Scuse me?
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
What?
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Maye it's me.
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Hey Rach.
Stop picturing it!!
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
If the school finds out you're fired.
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
What are you talking about?
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
No he's not!
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Ah.
Well maybe we just take that one away.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Okay.
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
What?!
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
Awesome!
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
There are seven?!
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Hey Pete.
Hi, how ya doing?
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Well, we should probably get going.
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
I don't know, I don't have my jammies.
Well, maybe you don't need them.
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
Ohh!!
There it is.
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
What are you doing here?
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
Still?!
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Oh.
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
You get your messages!
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
Yeah.
I never had a bike of my own.
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
What, look back?
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Why is your family Ross?!
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Hi Pheebs!
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Woah.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Well, thanks anyway.
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Will you stop!
Okay. All right.
Gin.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
Why?
You are an idiot. .
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
What?
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
And twenty-five it is.
You gave him cookies?
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
You are?
Yeah!
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
How we doing, you guys ready?
Some days it's all I can think about.
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Just mine?
I'm afraid so.
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
They kept your room for a while.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
What is the matter with you?!
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
What was that?
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
Time is money my friend?
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
I didn't know it was a big secret.
You have a third nipple?
You bitch.
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Not a basset, a bassinet.
You really need the bassinet?
Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.
Uh-huh.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Okay, good.
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
That cup is mine!
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
This totally makes sense!
It does not!
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Absolutely! Absolutely!
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Hello? Who are we spying on?
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
Oh!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
That can be arranged.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Yes!
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Damnit Carl!
Oh my good God.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Sorry! Sorry.
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
It's my New Year's resolution!
What, to blind my child?
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
I know honey, I'm sorry.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
What?
I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Did you smoke?
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Richard!
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
So uhh, you ready?
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Yeah.
Hello!
Yes, and grumpy.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
What? That's impossible.
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
No, just give me another minute.
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
Yeah.
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Oh, Chantal!
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
The what?
No, I think it's cute.
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
Depends on what you mean by we.
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
What?
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
I have plans.
You're plans were with us.
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
But you're not.
God. I love you.
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
Men just take out wind?
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
Phoebe, tell her!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What? Ow!
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Sorry, that was wax.
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Oh Willie's still alive!
What are you guys doing?
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Well this is just sad!
That is not a problem.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
I made fun of his accent.
No.
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Okay.
What the hell is that?
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
But, but?
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Right, and...
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
But you've only slept with two people.
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
No more jam?!
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
What are you talking about?
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
You're plans were with us.
That's right.
Okay.
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
They don't have those.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Ohhh, yeah!
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Ross, that is gorgeous!
Yeah?
Hey.
Hey. Hi Phoebe.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
Put all my money in me.
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
Tho?
Ohhh.
Ok.
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Well...
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
They're not listening too me?
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
I know I love you!
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
I'm marrying her.
We'll just see.
Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!
I hope it's you.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Ohhh!
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
I need to get some Richard.
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Maybe, because you told him not to.
What are you the memory woman?
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
What if they get mixed up?
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
-leg?
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Ooh, steer clear of you.
That's right.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
Oh.
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Joey, speed it up!
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
We know!
Okay.
Okay, everybody hold!
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
Aw.
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
What-what-what are you gonna do?
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
It could happen.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
I hate men! I hate men!
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
Oh, ok bye-bye.
Grazie.
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Well, get it off now!
I can't! It-it's stuck!
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Maybe nobody's tried this.
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
Okay.
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
Huh?
Check out the rack on this chick!
No, I'm not!
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Rachel?!
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Hi, sure!
Hi.
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
No thanks, Josephine.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
It's not?
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
It's coming from Joey!
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
Still?!
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Two.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
That's what you say about porn.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Okay great!
Yeah!
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
Getting it away from me would be job one.
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
God, what is wrong with me.
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
No?
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Um-hmm.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Right.
You said no right?
Huh?
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Yeah.
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
What?
Could tonight be the Night?
So, did you shave your legs?
Yeah.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Hi!
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Ok, this could be tough.
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
It's James Bond.
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Those two only had each other!
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Okay. Well there's one down.
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
I'm gonna start getting ready!
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Why do they keep doing that?
Right.
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
What's wrong Phoebe?
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Hey, Danny!
Hey! What's going on?
Salad.
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
...I can imagine.
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Tell her what?
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
He's so cute.
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Naked friends.
Hey.
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
Y'miss it?
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
That's ridiculous!
Can I use.. either thumb?
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
No.
Really?
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Like what?
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Hey! I made that for her!
You made pottery?
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
You had fantasies about Emily?
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
But we've only had one job.
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Hello!
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Okay, I didn't hear that.
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
I can't believe this!
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
Fine!
You found that handle, did ya?
That's not funny.
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
What are they?
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
I had to go with the odds Rach.
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
I'm so glad you liked them!
Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Will you get us better gifts?
Fine!
That's what you got me?
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
Pretty much.
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
You could kick anyone's ass you want too.
Thanks you guys.
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
He is the man in the black dress.
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
I got it!
Okay.
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Oh.
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Oh, I got that for him.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
What in God's name is that?!
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
Who are you saying "check" too?
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Hey!
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
Well thanks!
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
And where is your hat?
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
Sounds great.
Okay.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Well, you know Chandler.
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Can I get you some coffee?
Hi, sure!
Hi.
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
Well, people are different.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
No.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
I don't like your massages.
See? It's no big deal.
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Joey, you had the night!
What?
You-you think?
Did you like learn about her family?
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
Why?
Because they made me.
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Monica, what are you doing?
I guess it was kinda funny.
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
Yeah!
With what?
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
What do you, what do you mean?
Surprise...
Sur-surprise.
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
There's gravy?
What are you doing?
I think I left a donut up here.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
What are you talking about? What wedding?
Come on, like you never talk that.
Afraid to ask him?
Could not be more terrified.
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
God! What are you, in second grade?
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!
What?
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Yes, but there isn't always time!
Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
Yeah!
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Yeah!
Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
Well...
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
Regular or decaf?
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
I know I couldn't. So....
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Woo-woo!
I can't believe you did that!
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Phoebe, what are you doing?
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
Hi.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
What are you smiling at?
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Alright, what have we learned so far?
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Ohh, I love birds.
What is the matter with you ?!?
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
But we're not ready to tell yet!
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Hey! Hi!
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Oh, she's gonna love that!
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
It's for their own good.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
Very good.
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Really?
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Okay. I'll be right there.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
...Take off their hats!
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
Hey guys.
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Mmmm! It's good!
Really? How good?
Mmm.
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Phoebe.
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
You want me to see a therapist?
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
And-Joey!
Do you want me to learn?!
Let's give it a shot.
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
How did you do that?
I don't know!
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Hey.
Hey.
Ehh.
Eh, you work for that.
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
You hated me when we were kids?
Why did you hate me?
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
All right. Bye.
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
I miss you already!!
I miss you too!!!!
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
Okay, come here!
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
Bye.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Yes!
Would it matter?
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Honey, there's a reason.
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
Have you seen Chandler?!
No! Why?
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
What?!
Does that mean Carcass is available?
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Well, sure, that too.
Can't hear you!
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Well, those were seals, man.
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
I'm not freaking out.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
Guys guys, check this out.
Excellent.
Ohhh.
What?
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
What?
Why?
Hey!
What a tool!
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
So that's two of my wives.
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Hey.
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
Hot dog?
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
What?
Monica, I'm cutting you off.
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Oh God!
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
What?!
I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
Alright, we have to talk.
There it is!
Is there somebody else?
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
All right. I think it was a mouse.
How are you honey?
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
What's this?
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
Really?
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
But you're not.
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Hm-mmm.
Oh, yeah, good idea.
Hey man, what's up?
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Ewwww!!
Ewwww!!
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Oh, fine! Take his side!
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
You're Lewis Posin.
Who?
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Isn't he good?
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
I believe you know my husband.
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
I bet it was about her a little.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Oh my God.
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Yes.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
We both do that!
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Would you excuse me for a second?
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
Hi.
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
2 hours, 27 minutes.
Really?!
Hey Rach!
Hey.
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Well, what's the job?
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
Is Tony Randall dead?
No.
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Okay!
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
I, I don't have it.
Nobody does honey.
Hi.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Ohhh!
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
What are you doing?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Let's go!!
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
Megan!
Monica!
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Which one was Pete Carney?
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Great!
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
What's Phase Two?
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
You owe me 20 bucks.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
All right, I'm nine years old.
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
I don't want things to change! Do you?
No!
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Hey!
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
Does it matter?!
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
Yes!
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Okay.
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
And also, my birthday.
It's not your birthday.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Well, yeah actually.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
We are! Help us!
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Oh, okay.
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
You mean there's more than one of us.
Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
Ok, then just go.
Ok.
Sure.
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Oh. Thanks.
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
What?
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
Yeah.
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
No! Never! Never! Bye.
No touch! No touch!
That's sweet.
No, it's more like a good luck.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Why?
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Really?! Really?!
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Hey, Sophie!
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
Oh, please.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
I sure did!
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Hey!
Hey!
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Like an eclipse.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
Ew, this feels very weird.
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Wow!
Do we have to?
No.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
Done.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
But if...
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
I am a good kisser.
Is that the heartbeat?
That's it.
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Oh, yeah. I know that.
I so wanna be attracted to you.
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
If you want.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
You were invited?!
No.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
I can't believe she's married.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
Okay.
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
What is the matter with you?!
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
What's hard to believe?
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Electrical plans for the building.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Wow! If only more people knew.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
Okay. Sorry.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Well, I never call me.
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
What? What? Why?!
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
That's right.
Chandler loves marriage!!
You got that from what I said?!
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Are you okay?
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
I bet he can.
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Jody!
You were with Julie?
Oh. Oh my God.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Ooh! Brian's Song!
The meeting with the guy went great?
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
What check thing?
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
That's Bill Clinton.
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
OK, stop.
Hey Rach.
Ahhhh.
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Yes!!! Oh!!
Hypothetically!
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Okay.
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
You are so cute.
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
What?
You've got panties stuck to your leg.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
Um-hmm.
What am I making him by the way?
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
That's not funny.
Well that's not true.
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
You do?
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
No way. No way did you do this.
Monana was very brave.
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Noo!!!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Yeah, get out!
One more game?
Oh yeah!
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
In a bad way?
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
Sorry.
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
What a wank!
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
All right.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Big time!
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
What for?
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
But I...
It is? Really?
Yeah, sweetie.
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
OK, tip the man.
Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.
Ooh, this is it, 74.
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
She's not Rachel.
Oh my god.
Oh my god good?
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
She lets you borrow them.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
What else?
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
What?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
I didn't know you could get married here.
May I help you?
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Floopy?
Yeah.
Oh, like that's a word.
Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
How do you mean?
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Sure.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
I want the little round waffles.
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Arghhhh!!!!!!
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
BEND OVER?!!!
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
You know where I work!
I do?
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
To get you to make out with him!!!
Ohhh.
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
Oh, it's gonna be fine.
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
For camp!
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Uh-huh.
Look I want you, now.
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
Joey, no means no!
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
Whoa.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
It's that terrible?
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
I love you too.
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
No.
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
No.
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
But we can go, right?
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
Yay!
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Oh hey, here Pheebs.
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
All right. Okay. I'm starving!
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Come on.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Hey!
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Is it dry in here?
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
I'm so glad you liked them!
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Well, you seem fine.
You mean like exclusive friends?
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
Okay, I'm hearing.
What?!
Or! A bakery delivery person.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Whatcha doin'?
Ooh.
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
What?
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Umm, can we see you ride it?
Okay. See?
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
Oww!
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
How is that ever going to happen?!
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Well maybe we just take that one away.
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Ow!
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Monica! Hi honey.
All right, on the table.
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
Promise me you'll be careful.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
Yeah.
All right. I think it was a mouse.
How are you honey?
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
What?!
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
Phoebe!
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
I'm gonna do it.
But I...
Please!
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Umm, I'm still here.
You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Two girls and a boy?
Yeah!
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Yeah.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Okay. I'll be right there.
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
We're the Bings.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
They kept your room for a while.
Come on, you know they love you.
As much as they love you?
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Really?
Sorry.
Who?
Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Well, I did not know that.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Nooo!
No-no-no-no, we're done.
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Hey!
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Why to save your dignity my man.
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
I said name one!
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
I'm just easing you in.
Oh, alright.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Sure.
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Another good point.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
Yes!
What thing?
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
I'm gonna do it.
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Yeah! You're the best!
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
Your sunglasses?!
Yes!
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Pete, can I get you something else?
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Sorry.
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Hello!
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
Sure.
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
You really sure?
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
Ok.
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
I called him.
Nooo.
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
Alright, shall we?
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
Thank God.
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
What does it look like? I'm going home.
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Not any more.
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
So how's it going with you guys?
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
Ah!!
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
That, that's what's stupid.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Looking up?
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
Are you crazy?!
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
No.
I mean don't you trust her?
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
Sure.
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
"You have two new messages."
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
What did you get?
Credit.
Hi.
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Oh.
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
Hi!
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
They had to have that specially made?!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
What?
Are you serious?
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
So you like it?
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Well, then can we meet him?
Nope. Schhorry.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Really?
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Water! Water! Water!
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
What?!
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
What Richard thing?
Simmons! Go with Simmons!
I'm not mad.
Really?!
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Have you found your dress yet?
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Okay!
I have.
This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Because we can remember them.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Alright, I'll call you.
I don't think you mean that.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Well, we certainly are alone.
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Right.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Hey!
Hey, how'd it go?
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
No, don't say it.
...love you.
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
...And then he burst into flames.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Nah... not-not special enough.
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
No, my first fan mail.
Alright!
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Yeah-oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London...
Already?!
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
How-how did that happen?
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Monica...
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Really?
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
I thought you could use the help.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
This is the most special day of our lives.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Hey!
How did we do?
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
What?!
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Yeah baby! No baby!
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
He's fine!
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Chandler?
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Because the kids need new shoes.
This will just be my batch.
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Mon?
Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
No.
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Yeah, I heard it.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Y'know what? You are right?!
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Really?
Of course!
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
Hi, remember us?
Mmm hmmm.
You're that stupid.
I am. I'm that stupid.
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
Hey, I went up.
What?
Do what?
Put all my money in me.
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
What?! We can't do that!
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
What are you going to make?
Yummy noises.
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
We're switching rooms.
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
Hey!
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Ok, so let's talk money.
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
What?
Oh honey, but it is just about...
It is! It is!
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
In the game room!
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
How's it going?
Ooh!
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Joey, this is you!
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Can't hear you!
No ma'am.
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
What a baby.
Total wuss!
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
What do you got there?
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
Chicken Kiev?
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Woo-yay!!
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Bye! See you later!
Fun Bobby is so great.
Half full of looooovvvvve.
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
You had no relationship!!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Come on, hurry!
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Oh, good. Thanks.
Now what is Fabutec?
Waxine!!
Yes! Have you seen it?
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
You mean like exclusive friends?
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Oh, you go out with him.
Oh, really?!
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Gotcha.
Oh, you bet I am!
Okay, here's your penis!
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
I think that's fair.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Hi.
What?
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
So don't do it.
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
What's goin' on?
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
Oh!
No.
Oh.
Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
Okay.
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
That was pretty 007.
Hey.
Yeah, they're not coming.
What?!
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
She is a kook.
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
You know!
Okay. Good one.
Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
Way to be strong, man!
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Yeah?
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Doesn't matter.
What?
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
You want his yearbook?
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
It's really not that big!
Takin' that with you, huh?
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Oh my god.
What?
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
All right, you!
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
Hi.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
Aww, I love you so...
What is wrong with you?!!!
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
Yeah, me too!
Oh, look at that.
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
You sound like a guy.
You'll have a last kiss.
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
This woman's living my life.
What?
You're not an artist.
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Okay.
Are you all right?
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Okay, fine.
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Well it didn't!
What?!
Okay, that we may be able to do.
How?
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
I love you too.
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
I'd do anything for you.
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
Help!
Where have you been?
Oh, just had a baby.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
I was frustrated with you!
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
I think that's fair.
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
What was that?
Monica knows.
Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
I'm not arguing with that.
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
It's your joke.
Is not.
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
So this is Brooklyn.
Okay.
Got it.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Hey!
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
Great nap.
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Monica bang!
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
You okay?
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
I'll see you after work sweetie.
Okay. Bye!
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
It's Hexadrin.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
Oh.
Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
I miss you already!!
I miss you too!!!!
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Sure!
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
No.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
You love her!
What-what is love really?
I am a good kisser.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
Yeah!
Okay.
Aww!
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Hey!
Hey! What's up?
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
Not any more!
Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Ugh!
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
Oh my God.
I know. I need more pie.
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
Wooo!! Hoo!!
Okay quick, help me get this off!
Yeah!!
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
Well, what am I going to say?
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
He took off?
Go on! Go on.
Chandler?
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
I don't know. A month?
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Sometimes we were.
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
You're our age!
So ah, we on for tomorrow?
Yeah, kinda.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Why?
Because!
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You don't even know me...
