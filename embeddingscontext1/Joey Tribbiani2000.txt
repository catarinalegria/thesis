That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Bite me, blondie!
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
What's the matter?
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
What's going on?
He's retiling my floor.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
But I'm the host!
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
Well, here's your phone doctor.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Let me see that! Oh man!
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
Yeah! Okay.
: That book got me through some tough times.
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
There is a little child inside this man!
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
That is true.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
So what, we just sit?
Hello, Chandler Bing.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
Really?! You think that will work?
What the heck is that?
Did she call?
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
No, can we get back to me?
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
There she is.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Rach, these are for you.
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
OK, Phoebs, your turn.
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Exactly! Unisex!
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
That's OK.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Who are they killing off?
Noo!!
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
Woah, dude, burn.
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
Oh-oh, that's your thing.
What?
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
All right, there you go!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Oh, just years of experience.
Can I get some ice here?!
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
Say what?
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
Hey!
How'd the callback go?
So what'd you do?
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
Let's see, ahhh... Where does the Pope live?
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
Spock's birth control.
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Joey, why is your cable out?
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
What's up?
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Really?
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?
Oh.
But how about tomorrow?
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
No!
Sorry!
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
But it's dark out.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her...
That's interesting, but check this out. I date her...
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
It's gotta be the first one.
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
That's not a question.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
That is so sweet!
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Right.
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
You're gonna have to pee on it.
What?!! Gross!!
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Oh hey!
Oooh!
I get to hire my own assistant!
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Havin' some trouble?
Rachel locked the door.
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Ooh, it's not bad.
Okay.
Hey! You okay?
Ooh, something hurts!
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Hey.
Sorry.
And the bunny got away.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Hey Gunther.
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
Do you still work here?
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!


C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
That is lucky.
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
You are soo enjoying this.
You know the words! You are so into this!
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Yeah, we are so sorry.
You're kinda stepping on the song.
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
So let's decide on the spending limit...
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
No she hasn't.
Well, what am I going to say?
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
1200.
Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
Uh, the dog.
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
You're it! Now run and hide!
It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
I say, punch him Joey.
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
Joey!
Esther Livingston. Gone.
Hi, Phoe.
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
Right. Could you sign this?
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
Cool, thanks.
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
And?
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
Really?!
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Yeah!
Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Is this guy great or what?
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
So you're not homesick yet?
No, I don't think so.
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
What four of us?
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
She's right! You have to stop!
What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Oh no, no, no, no.
What, what is that?
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Hi!
Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
Joey!
Good for you!
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
How often do you read it?
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
That was me.
Oh, en chante.
That's me.
Ahh, yes.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
That's right!
But at least the apothecary table is real.
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
That's totally understandable.
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
Hey! I got great news!
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
No.
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Yeah.
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Oh, hey.
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Hey, I'm back!
Hi-hi Joey.
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
Yes.
Wow!
It's not a big deal!
They were lovers.
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
And no one touches the air around the TV!
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Oh no-no-no!
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Hey!
Hi!
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
Oh-no-no-no-no....
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Yeah.
Five.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
Oh my God!!
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
It's not charity, Joe...
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
Excuse me?
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
I didn't know it was an auction!
Wh?!
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
I don't know! Charity?
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
Get away from me I said no!
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Bye.
Bye, good luck.
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Really? A purse?
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
So?
Oh, good point.
Yeah!
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Tell it again. Seriously.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Well, I think we all learned something.
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
Well, that's great.
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
Hey, Rachel.
Hi!
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
Wheel!
Of!
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Yeah, big fan.
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
Here!
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
It's uh, it's already been roasted.
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
Okay.
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
Yeah baby!
But, we pick again! We pick again!
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Go on.
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
Yeah?
Oh my God. I mean...
He's holding us back.
Totally.
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
What?
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
I got glasses!
Well, you-you've always had glasses.
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Wait a minute!
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
Over a month.
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
I don't want to do that.
Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Hi!
Love your condoms my man.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
It's called the cherry.
It's the-Chandler!!
Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
Oh-ho, yeah!
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
I was afraid of that.
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Okay.
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
I so am.
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Well, this all looks good.
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
Hey! Hey!!
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
No, sorry.
All right, maybe I should call her.
He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
Huh? Uh...
Dude! Dude!
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
What?! Tonight?!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Oh my God you stole her award!
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
Our place, the hall! I...
I got something for her. It's a book!
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
I know!
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
Okay.
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Whatever.
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
Oh hi!
Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
I think it was valued at 19,000
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
We're very happy for you.
What's the matter?!
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Joey, speed it up!
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Yeah.
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Oh that would be great!
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Wh-why?
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
I am dressed.
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
No! God, would you just calm down!
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
This will be your phone.
No you answer it and take pledges.
But I'm the host!
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Oh!
My God!
Excuse me?
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
We came over as soon as we saw.
How could you not tell us?
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
Thanks.
How good is that?
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Man's got a point.
Crazy bitch.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!
We have one.
I know. Use it.
Excuse me?
It's me, Joey!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
You don't know?!
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
Thanks!
Yes, very nice Rachel.
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Hey.
Urse...
Listen, um...
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
No, I just, I fell down.
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Why-why would I care about that?
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
All right, sorry.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
No-no, she really is sick!
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
Hi.
Hey.
That was 14 hours ago.
So how'd it go?
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Oh that would be great!
Joey, you don't have too!
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Really?!
Thanks.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Joey!
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Nothing?
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Oh, right, that's me!
Fine.
Phoebe, what is it?
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Ok, that's enough.
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Feel better now?
Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
What?
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
Sure, what do you want to see?
I don't know, umm...
Umm, no thank you.
What's with her?
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Tell me about it.
Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
But Mon, you have to get our money!
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Okay.
Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
Chandler!
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
So, what're you gonna do?
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
I've never slept with someone for a part.
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Many are scheduled to appear.
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
Okay.
Okay, now I'm really late.
Bye.
Bye.
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
Whoa! Are you okay?
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
Hey-hey.
Guess what, I got an audition!
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
You bet! What's the part?
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
What kinda things have you been saying?
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?
Right, I go-, I got it.
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Hey, nice toilet.
No no no, behind it.
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Erin! Still here!
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
I know!
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Phoebs, what's goin' on?
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Well, so why not go knock?
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Won't-won't that take longer?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
That's right.
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
Okay!
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
What is it?
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
What, what's that?
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Hey! I made that for her!
You made pottery?
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Yeah.
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
Really?
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
What about the closeness?
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
How did you make $17.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
You do?
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
Thank God!
Oh, I can't go.
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Me?
That would work.
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
North route!
Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Hey!
Oh, this guy again.
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
Hey!
Hey!
What is DOOL?
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
What? That's impossible.
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Here's your tea Phoebe.
It's so good. Oh, thanks.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Okay, take it easy.
Hey! That's my car.
What-what are you doing?
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
Hey.
Hey.
Sure.
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
Sure! Where is it?
Ohh! So you're 5639?!
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
Look, look, I have elbows!
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Pshhshhh!
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Where in Cuba?
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
That cold makes you sound so great.
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Well, I want it!
You can have it!
Oh, no! No!
It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Wooooo!!!!
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
Come on, take 'em off!!
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
So, I hear, you hate me!
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
Ross, you need some help?
From you? Yes, please!
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
No thanks, Josephine.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Oh Jack stop.
C'mon, it's my birthday.
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
Fine!
Yeah!
Hey!
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
You have pets!
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
Sorry.
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
And I just want a million dollars!
It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
It'll be great for next weekend.
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
What's going on?
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
What?! That's the first time today!
Ohh!
I'm 16.
See you in 2003.
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Really?
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Yeah?
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
Come, come here.
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Excellent, I'll be there.
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
Sing!!
I wanna rock and roll all night!
Morning!
Hey!
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
That's a hernia.
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
Seriously, what-what's the part?
C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
...I'm his
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
We could eat the wax! It's organic.
Oh great, food with hair on it.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
We love you, we're here for you.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
...Flame Boy.
Where exactly is your zoo?
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
What?!
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Joey, did you my face cream?
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Where do you think, Zelda?
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
Thank you.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
She's still asleep.
So how'd it go?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Shhhh!
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
And there is Kevin.
Can we please turn this off?
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
What about Game 1 of the Series?
What about shut up?
Okay.
So how's it goin' with Joey?
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
You do, huh?
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
All right, see you later.
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
Umm, okay.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Hey, opposite, is opposite!
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
What's going on?
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Uh, Joey..
Oh, God!
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
And heels.
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Okay, in we go.
Here you go.
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
You totally screwed him over.
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
Hi Daddy.
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Those two only had each other!
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
There you go!
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
Its Phoebe! Hi!
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
It's a different building.
Why don't we start right now!
Okay.
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
No.
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Sort of...
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
Pretty good.
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
Wow! Didn't know that.
Great!
Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
No. No, I haven't seen him.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Why can't you tell her?
Joey! Joey!!
Yeah?
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Oh, Judy. Oh, Judy.
Oh, ohhhhh.
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Alright open your eyes.
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Beth, Beth dies?
Um-hmm.
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
What?!
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
Hey!
Sh-shh-shh!
Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
Oh, Chandler.
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Sandy.
Yeah. That's okay, right?
Par-tay!
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
I'll remember that.
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
Oh.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
I don't know Rach.
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
How ya doin'?
Who in the hell are you?
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
I haven't seen him in so long!
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
What happened to Janine?
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
Dry cleaners?
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
This is amazing.
I know.
OK, Rachel, I'm ready.
OK.
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Do we have to tell her?
Yes, we have to tell her!
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Well, there you go.
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
What kind of problem?
Oh my God!
Nooooo!
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
What is going on here?
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
We're so sorry.
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
All right, you have yourself a deal.
Okay. See?! I told ya!
Here, we are.
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Tell him it's for you.
Feeling a little better sweetie?
Me too.
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Hey!
How was your first day?
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
No, I think that was the whole all.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?
Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Noo! NO!
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
All right!
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
So what'd you do?
Good for you.
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Why am I looking?
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
Oh Joey!
That's right!
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Hey Chandler!
Hey!
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Hey.
Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
Why not?
Because! You're mean on the boat!
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Hey!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Yeah!
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
What?!
For all the free food you gave away.
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Hey!
Drums?
No! Drums!
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
Who wants French toast?
Oh, I'll have some!
Oww!
What's the matter honey?
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Everything? Even the TV?
No! I'm putting that in my room.
What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
Throw in the duck too!
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Look, we are not gonna...
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Okay.
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
You do?
Yeah.
What?
Yeah, she broke up with me.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
That is the Coast Guard.
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
All right.
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
Give me that!
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Thank you!
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
Joey, bravo!
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
I am definitely gonna watch that!
What about these? These look the same?
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
See you in 2003.
You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
Yeah, thanks.
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
No I won't.
You don't even know!
Well look, if you don't like this...
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
Yes!
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
There's an image.
Would anybody like more coffee?
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
Now she sounded breezy.
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Hey!
What's up?
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Oh well, okay, good luck.
Yeah.
Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
Okay.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
You call that delicious?
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Okay. Hut! Hike!
Fumble!
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
That is so good! Do it again!
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
No no, that's me.
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
Ma?
Joey!
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Are you naked in there?
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
Hi.
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Well then, do it better!
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
No, sorry.
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Well, the duck...
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
Go ahead.
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
Okay.
No-no-no-no!
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
Who was it?
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Sure!
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
I'm sorry.
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
You don't drink.
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
You guys are messin' with me, right?
Yeah.
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Maureen Rosilla.
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
So what.
So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
Toilet paper?
Yeah.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Ow!
I'm outta here.
Really?
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Hey...
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
Yeah, right!
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
Oh my God!
What?
They don't?
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
Games and stuff.
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
There's an ad for a naked chef?
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
You have to respect the sea!
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
Oh!
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Come on!
I can't believe this!!
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Yeah! She's right in there!
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
Yeah.
I'll take it. My gift to you man.
Here are your cakes.
We didn't order cake.
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
What-what are you doing?
But it's my car!
Yeah, but it's my wax.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Hey Pheebs.
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Okay, I'm totally cool!
Come in.
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
So...Thank you.
Could you be less enthused?
Like?
Charity.
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
Someone in here.
Where's Chandler?
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats.
Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
Come on! That's great.
Wow!
Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
I know!
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
Yeah?
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
What? You mean behind my back?
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Wow, he looks so normal.
He's even kind of cute.
Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
Oh, my.
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
Fine with me.
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
No, not getting my bra!
Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?
The one in the director's chair.
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
How could you have told her?
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Okay!
Too dry.
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Aw, dammit!
Back on in 30 seconds people!
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Hi.
Just uh, brought back your videos.
No! No we don't!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Uh, what was that?
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
Oh my god!
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?
Noo.
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
I didn't know that.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
The one with "Heston" on it.
Interesting.
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
Ohh whoops.
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
You can say that again Mac.
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
But what?
She keeps punching me.
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Is that some kind of boat talk?
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
Hey guys!
Hey, all right!
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Please. This is so your fault.
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Ow!
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
What are you gonna do?
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Joey!
Oh man!
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
What's going on?
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Yeah that's better than my way.
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
I... I don't know what you are talking about.
I've had better.
Okay! When?!
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
4:30.
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
Yes. Vividly.
She was kidding about that right?
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.
It can do this.
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Oh!
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
That can be arranged.
Let's reset.
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
Hey, Kate!
Morning.
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Really? Male nurses?
Yeah, I was bummed too.
Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
Oh Hans.
Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
I'll never forget you Hans.
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
Chandler.
Awww, man! Really?
That's a good point.
Yeah.
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
Come here, check this out!
What? Is it the comet?
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Y'know, there's two women dude.
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Oh, yeah, right.
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
She is gonna hate me.
Yeah, well...
That's patio furniture!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Probably kill myself!
..Excuse me?
Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
What?!
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
Well have we finished the scene?
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
He is so amazing.
Oh, I know. Look at him.
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
He doesn't do much, does he?
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
Well where... Where did she go?
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Nooo.
Oh. What do you do?
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one.
Uh-huh.
So uh, which one is mine?
Ohh yes.
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Yeah, it's mine.
I bet it's fast.
Yeah!
It's got 'em!
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Wh-what?
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
Destiny.
Sure.
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Sure! Why?
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Okay, here we go...
There. Now there is.
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Man's got a point.
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
You did!
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
Okay.
What are you doing?
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
So, we gettin' a fish?
You had sex with her didn't you?
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Page 42, page 42, page 42.
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
At least I care about his feelings!
What?!
And why wouldn't he get it?
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
You have pets!
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Really?
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
What?!
The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
I'm starving!
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Please! I made this game what it is.
Not fun anymore?
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
No! No we don't!
I... I don't know what you are talking about.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
Hey, thanks for talking to me.
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
What?
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
It's all London, baby! Here we go.
You got your passport?
Ohh!!
There it is.
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
Yeah.
Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
Well, I feel like a snack!
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Oh.... my God.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
I mean, this is unbelievable.
I know. This is really, really huge.
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Dude-dude-dude!
What?!
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
So what job did you get Joe?
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Here you go.
Oh.
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Pardon?
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Well, these really are the days of our lives.
What?!
Oh God!
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
You got a callback too didn't you?
Yeah I did!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
I don't know! But it's the same!
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Full house.
You got me.
: I thought we had them!
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Because we won our apartment back!
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Yeah, so.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
I didn't know that.
I never knew that either.
Hey guys! What's up?
Heyyy.
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Alright, so what's it about?
Well I like both eggs equally.
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
Gunther, kiss me.
What?
Can I sleep on your couch?
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Say it!
Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
No.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Uh yeah, right here.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
I'm intrigued.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
We did it!!
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
Oh well, okay, good luck.
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
Oh. Oh.
Joey...
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
Yes!!
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Nope, not that one.
Can you go any faster with that?
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Aw, I know all about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Aw, don't do that
We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Hey.
Hey! How'd the audition go?
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
Yeah, did I fool ya?
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Okay.
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
All right!
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
What?
I love you.
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
Hey!
Hey! What's up?
Oh thanks!
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
You do know that Wham broke up?
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Where is Emily?
Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
What's in the bag?
Um, just some presents.
OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
Cute.
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Oh great!
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Okay, I'll stop.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
You wanna play?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
I thought you could use the help.
Coffee in a fight!
Sure! Why?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Ooh!
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
Howdy.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Oh, just do it!!
Op, op, I'm convinced!
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
All right!
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Yeah!
I know. They were mine.
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
Well, there you go.
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Hey.
Hey.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
I told ya.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Yeah, me either.
Maybe I could do it.
That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Hey!
Hey!
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
It's 4:30.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
You mean with Casey.
Or Casey.
No-no, Kathy.
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
Yeah!
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Why?
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Oh, no.
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
No he didn't.
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
You really didn't have to. Wow.
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
On your dresser.
Okay that is the one we already have!
What?
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
Oooh.
With mealworms.
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Oh, well I'm uh...
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
13.
Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
What?
My identical hand twin!
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
Done.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Oh, well great.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
Uhhhh.
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
Three, Two, One!
Cut!
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Absolutely!
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
We'll talk later.
Yeah. Thank you.
Shut up, and put my table back.
Okayyy!
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
In the moment, yeah.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Hey, hey, they're runnin'
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Get out.
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
Hey.
Hey.
I had one.
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
You don't have any secrets!
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Ugh.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
This is ridiculous.
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
Oh for cryin' out loud!
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
It's my joke.
It's my joke.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Let's go watch it at your place.
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Oh no-no-no-no!
We don't know what could make this go away.
And no one touches the air around the TV!
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Well, it does.
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
No you're not.
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
Hello? Hi.
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
Taste it.
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Oh, no!
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
H-h-h-how's the duck?
He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
No, that's all right.
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Hi.
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
Your what?
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
You're welcome.
Woof, woof.
Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
Who?
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Ross, I...
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Because I lose her stuff!
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Rach? What are you doing?
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
Ahh, to be 13 again.
Yeah.
You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I won't leave you!
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Maybe that's the problem.
What?!
Is that some kind of boat talk?
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Hey!
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
How does it happen?
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
What's fish hooking?
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Oh no!
You slept with my sister?
This is not good for my rage.
Monica, is this true?
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
You sick bastards!
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Hey sweetie!
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
Come on!
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Professor Geller?
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Oh great!
Oh, okay.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Huh. A moo-point?
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
I had a wedding.
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
Isn't Ben in this?
Oh, yeah!
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Listen, um...
I'm sorry.
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Thank you.
We were playing poker, alright...
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
And then he did.
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
Hi!
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
You think?
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
Yeah.
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Hey!
There he is!
No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
Ohh great!! Hello.
Joey, it's Phoebe. Did you stop Rachel?
So nothing got ruined?
No.
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Why would they think they're invited?
You got me. I don't...
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
You take your time.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
And your friend Phoebe?
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
All right!
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
No. I've learned my lesson.
Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
I get to hire my own assistant!
Ahhh!!
And you were at this job for four years?
That's right.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
Okay, see ya later.
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
He just said, "No strippers."
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
No, Janice.
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
They don't?
How does it happen?
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Wow, how many have you got?
Fifty-six!
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
How come we have one extra place setting?
No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
Come on man, you're not a potato.
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
Is that what I want?
Yes.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
I know!
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Are you okay?
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
And did you notice...?
Yeah.
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
...What shoe?
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
I put it on to scare Chandler!
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
Hey!
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Hello to the rest.
Hi!
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
What happened?
Joey, why would you do that?
Because they wanted me to audition!
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Oh.
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
You guys live around here too?
You know it?
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
Thank God! I'm exhausted!
So you guys want coffees?
Yeah, me too.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Nice!
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Yeah.
A-ha!
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Great, you can cover Chandler.
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
You know what the. . .
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
No, no!
What are you crazy?!
Allll done!
Aww, thank you.
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
Really?
Yeah, for you!
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Hey!
You did it! You got ordained?!
Our minister...
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
That's great Joe!
Uh-huh.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
You are so beautiful.
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
Oh my God!
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Oh-oh.
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Don't touch him!
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Thanks for telling me!
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Okay, break-up's still on!
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Hi guys!
Hey!
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Wow, how many have you got?
Fifty-six!
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
Hey Rach?
Yeah?
Oh my God! Joey!
What is the matter with you?
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Yeah.
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
Alright, could I just ask you one question?
Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
You meant sex, right?
Do you have a sec?
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
What, what's that?
Open it, open in.
Oh my God.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
I've been back and forth.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!

There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Yes!
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Yeah! No?
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
Hiya!
Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
Scene 5, take 1.
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
Are you seein her again tonight?
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
Who?
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
What do ya say? What do ya say?
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
Well ah, what can you swing?
You don't have, anything?
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
For three years?
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Yeah, me too.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
How sad are we?
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
I just asked that girl out.
Nice!
Yes it is. See.
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
There are?
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
She was kidding about that right?
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Dude, I don't know.
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
So that story doesn't make you cry?
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
What's this?
Aww, thanks man.
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
What did you get her?
A pen.
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Why not?
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Yep!
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Your tax dollars?
Yeah, okay.
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
It could've been a hair straightener.
Oh.
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Thanks Monica!
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
Really? You'll do anything?
Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
What about the birds?
You pick one.
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
Eddie.
Morning.
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
"Heating device."
Radiator.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Good one.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
Like-like what?
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
It is???
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
That was my dad!
Oh my God!
Oh, did you catch him?!
Uh-huh.
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together.
But what does that gonna do...
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
Ohh.
Really?! How come?
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
I hate you!!
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Monica, Monica is great.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Yeah, isn't he?
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.
Hey.
Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
What's this?
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
I can't believe he didn't come!
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Yeah.
We just want you to think it through.
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Great.
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
Hey, what's up?
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Two?
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
Nooo, four.
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Oh!
Ow!
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
And an assistant.
Sophie, get in here!
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Who are you going out with?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
What is this? Fruit?
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Yeah, I understand.
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
Well that too. Joey?
Yeah?
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
Well, uh.
Really?
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Knick fan?
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
What's he doin' in my section?
I guess he doesn't know.
Mornin'.
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
Oh, hi!
Hey.
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
Oh my God! What happened?
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Die Hard 2.
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Joey, we just saw it!
And?
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
And your friend Phoebe?
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
All right, I'm sorry.
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Yes that was mine.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
Hey!
Hey!
Huh. All right.
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Over a month.
Sure, I'd like that.
So uh, what's your name?
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
Hello?
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
I don't want to hear about her!!
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
Kate, do you even like me?
Of course I do.
I don't know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy... Why can't I just pick someone like you?
Thanks.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
I-kea! This is comfortable.
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
Okay.
And for you sir?
It's uh, it's already been roasted.
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
I'm doing my scenes with you?
Nice to meet you Joey.
No I didn't.
I think you did.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
No kidding.
Where do you work?
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
She keeps punching me.
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Nice!
Well, you certainly own that room.
Hi.
Hey!
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Wow!
Really! You got a place upstate?
Sure!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Yeah!
Yeah!
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Oh my God!
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
The silk? Feels really good!
Huh.
That's great Joe!
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Wh-what?! Why?!
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
I like it.
Are you kidding?
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Get out.
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
That's what they'll call us.
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
Hey!
Hey.
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Weird world. Your kids?
I figure my character has kids.
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Uh-huh!
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Why not?!
What is the thing?
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
What?!
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Hey, Pheebs.
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Right...
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
You spit on me man!
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Where?
At his apartment. Is this juice?
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
...He's in.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
All right.
Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Yes it's true.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
My God Monica!!
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Hey, here she comes.
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
The game is over, we eat now?
No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
My lighter's in there!
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
I had to go with the odds Rach.
The commercial?
No!
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Yes that was a nice place!
Yeah!
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Yeah!
You're building a post office?
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Hey Estelle, listen...
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
Really?!
Yeah!
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Which guy?
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
Okay! How you doin'?
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
You're not going to believe this!
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Again?
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Why not?
Because I lose her stuff!
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
...He's in.
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
Would you look at them?
Yeah, can't help but.
I miss Rose.
Oh, yeah?
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Thanks!
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
I guess.
Thank you.
Hey!
Hey!
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
Joey, do you have a minute?
Dude, what am I gonna...
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
I, um, can't tell you.
Joey, what's going on?
About what?
He's planning your birthday party.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
No I don't think so.
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
Oh, excuse me.
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Two?
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Yes! Whew!
We have to assign heads to something.
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Hey.
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
So the going for help went well?
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Then why are you smoking?
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Maybe you should.
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Oh, that is so not true.
Oh, it is.
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Nothing!
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Well, it involved Monica.
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Joey, you have got to take this back!
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
You wanna smell him?
I assume we're talking about the baby now.
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Hey.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
An egg?
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Cache? Jaunty?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
I'll be right back. What was that?
What?
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Ohh. Like what?
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
Open the box!!
What?!
So?
Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
What are you doing?
Ohh, sorry.
Ohh whoops.
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
No, it was just the three of us.
Huh!
You know what?
What?
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
It's ridiculous!
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Who are they killing off?
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
Yeah.
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Did I say you could smell it?!
I can't smell your sandwich?
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
And tell him what?
Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
I have actually not heard of that.
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Yes!!
Ohh!
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Oh. Aw, forget it.
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
That's very nice.
That's sweet, Joey.
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
No, I'm alright man. Really.
No, I'm picking you up.
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
OK, I'll see you later babe.
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
What?
This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
I have.
What's that smell?
I know!
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
What?!
No, no!
What are you crazy?!
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
I am dressed.
I have an oily T-zone!
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Hey!
Do we pay for this?
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
"Benefits lapsed."
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Let me see that!
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Yeah.
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
You.
You?
No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
Plastic spoons. Great.
Lick away my man.
What?
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
What the hell is that?!!
It's a, it's a cat!
Yes it is!
Why is it inside out?!
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
My folks.
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
What?!
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Hey!
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Oh yeah? That's great!
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Hi.
Hey!
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Hey.
So uhh, how's the palace?
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
I hope she throws up on you.
So...
Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
Wow! That is a bad audition.
How-how did you lose your job here?
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Do you still work here?
Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Great!
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
I don't think mine likes me either.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
Yeah let's head off to work.
We should go.
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
What-what are you talking about?!
Yeah. So?
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
Sweety, what are you talking about?
Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
Monica!
Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
No!
What?
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
Phoebs.
Wow.
Joey!
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Well, what is the truth?
Yeah, what's going on?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
I'm sorry, do I know you?
What are you doing?
Oh! You got it?!
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
Hey there Ross!
Hey!
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Yeah?
Why-why would I care about that?
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
I look more like him than you do!
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
I don't think so.
Wow!
Yeah.
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
Thanks! Let's keep going.
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
"Smoke away."
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
"...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
No! Why?
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
Hey.
Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
Ahh.
OK, ready when you are.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Heh, what d'ya say?
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
You're kidding.
Wow!
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
If anything should happen to him...
Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
He will, Joe.
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Monkey lover!
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
I've got a science question.
Hmm?
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Services? Oh, services.
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
Any time you're ready, Joey.
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
Hey I-
Hey what?
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
Excellent!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
Estelle said I didn't get it.
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
What kind of problem?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Okay sure!
Really?!
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
You can be the best man when I get married.
I'll never get to be a best man!
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
They break your heart, don't they?
Y'know, I don't really their permission.
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Oh! Pathetic!
Where?
Our place, the hall! I...
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
It could be like a big giant guy.
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
No.
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
Why not?!
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
This is your place?
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
Hi!
Hey!
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Oh that's great!
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
What?
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
So did you break up with Joanna?
I think so.
The volcano?
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Chandler-
You gotta let me slam the door!
Joey-
Ah! Huh?
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
I couldn't do it.
Good for you, Joey.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
Well umm...
The baby shower for Phoebe!
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
She was?
Well, she graduated from high school!
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
Phoebe, wait a minute!
I'm an assistant buyer!!
Yeah, all right.
Okay.
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
No, that's all right.
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
Hey.
Hey! How was sailing?
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Women are mean!!!
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Excuse me?
What?
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
You have a roommate?!
Yes, Denise. Denise!
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Well, you're gonna.
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Okay.
Yeah!
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
Nice!
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
You do?
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
Joey, do you work here?
No.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
You are really frightening me.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
What?
Well, what is it?
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
Hoyt?
Really, is he a swimmer?
He's got the body for it.
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
Oh my God!
What is that?
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Hey Pheebs!
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
Come on, two on one.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
He went out with my wife!
Joey!
That's my wife!!! Get out!
Well, we should go.
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
You guys wanna eat here?
Yeah! As long as we're here!
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
I know. My arm is killing me.
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
How does going to a strip club help him better?
Because there are naked ladies there.
There are naked ladies there too.
Yeah.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
What?!
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
Hey!
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Oh, I can't go.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Uh-hmm.
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Judge rules, no violation.
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
Ooh, that bad, huh?
What?
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
What?!
I've been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? Where have you been? Vic?!
What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
When is she leaving?
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Wait a minute.
What?
Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
You're driving me crazy with that!
Okay, I'll stop.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
You wanna play?
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Alright, alright, alright...
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Wow. He's strict.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
What gay thing?
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Hi.
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
I can't help it!
Borrow money from me?
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I am sorry, Chandler.
I am sorry, Ross.
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
Condoms?
And condoms are the way to do that?
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Take it back?
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Oh, we could do this all day.
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
You hug me!
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
Yeah.
Get out.
No.
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
So I'm gonna take off then!
What's so funny?
Oh.
What-what's so funny?
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
I was always Joanne.
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Booo!!
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
Let's go watch it at your place.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Yeah, I've been around.
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
Why?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
I can.
Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
Yeah!
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
That was good beer.
Ohh...
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Later!
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Saw what?
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
Hi!
Hi! What are you doing here?
Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
Hi!
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
Uhh, rub it?
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
Time's up, now your dead.
And deaf!
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Do we pay for this?
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
That is lucky.
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Oh, you weren't finished?
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
It's the same story.
Wow, it's really long.
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
Well, first it's not a purse.
Okay, anytime.
Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
What?!
All right, I'm gonna go!
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
There was nudity!
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
Hey! Any good mail?
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
"Benefits lapsed."
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Great! Roomie!
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
They don't look any bigger than me!
I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
All right.
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Can I help you?
He's not here right now.
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
Can't we just use a pen?
No, Amish boy.
I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
You could say that.
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
You and Rachel.
What? Why not?
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
Come on, lady!
Please, please take him too.
Hello! One marriage please!
Yep, we wanna get married!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
Oh, So you can move them!
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Hi.
Hi!
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
I am.
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
It's not that far! Just drop!
Do not rush me!!
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
That really was some of your best work.
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
Drum roll.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
You're actually going through with this?
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Rough numbers?
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Uh, if you say so sir.
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
After what I did? Can you blame her?
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Now calm down Joey.
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
I'm still on the set!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
How?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
What is this? Fruit?
Monica's making jam.
Because the kids need new shoes.
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Yeah. Right.
Okay.
Ross isn't here.
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
What is the matter with you?!
No! Barry and Mindy.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
Way to be cool, man.
What's he talking about?
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
Yeah!
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
Hey.
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
That's not Ross!
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
So what do you want me to do?
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Okay, done.
What's 'pleh'?
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
I Gotcha!!
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
Yeah, sure.
No, not you.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
You were amazing out there.
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
I can't take any...
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
Oh my God, you're back!
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
What's a Movement class?
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Oh, my baby!
Cut!
Oh, just years of experience.
Can I get some ice here?!
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
I say push her down the stairs.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Forget about her.
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Oh my God.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Yeah. No. No...
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
You're kidding.
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Oh, that's true.
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Ennnh.
I've got canned goods.
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
Come on! Do something!
I am, I'm ignoring you.
Oh, what the hell is that?
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
I-I wasn't in that.
I know.
Hi!
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
Wow, he looks so normal.
He's even kind of cute.
Funniest? Heckles?
That's what it says.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
M-Me again?
Sure! Why not?
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
You know the words! You are so into this!
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
So what are you gonna be?
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
Sure. What?
Well, first it's not a purse.
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
Oh no, wait! Joey!
73! 72! 71!
What?
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Raymond Chandler.
Someone you didn't make up!
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
For just you?
Yeah.
No I-I-I'm fine.
All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
Well at least we know she's a woman.
I can't believe she's married.
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
They're all tourists.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Good choice.
Thanks.
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
Hey!
Hey!
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
We have a half hour.
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
Okay.
Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
You know the hotels?
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Well, I-I could live without it.
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Oh, "you do, do you"?
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
I call Monica's room!
You can't just call Monica's room.
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
What?
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
You are now.
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Oh man.
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Well thanks!
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
Ehh.
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Oh that's great!
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
What?
What did Joey say? I like you back?
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
It came up.
So I nodded off a little.
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
Naked friends.
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Joey... Switzerland?
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
Toootal chick-flick.
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
There was nudity!
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Karen.
I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
Yep. Ice Capades.
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
What?!! What?
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.
Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
Do you have my credit card?
Thank God!
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
What?
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
I don't think so.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
Hey!
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
So, rocks.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
This took you all day?!
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
Hey!
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Get away from me I said no!
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Joey that is horriable.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
We do not have one of those signs.
Two girls and a boy?
Yeah!
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
You're on!
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Yes.
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Take off your shirt!
Oh my!!
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
It's-it's-it's almost dead!
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
I think so.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
You serious?!
That's great!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
What? Ow!
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Yes! Did you see that?
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Oh my God!!
That's where you pick up the bag.
Exactly.
Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
What?
I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
Ohhhh man
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Why don't you try to do-

To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
Well where... Where did she go?
I can't believe I ruined this.
I am so sorry man.
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Hey!
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
Monica! Would it?
She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Thanks.
Enough!
Lean-lean-lean!
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
You know it?
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Yeah.
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
That's not true!
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
Go!!
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Forget about her.
Course there, they just call it food.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
What is the matter with you?
Ugh!
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
What?
Cupping.
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
I said name one!
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
What?
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
No!
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
The volcano?
What?!
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Probably just the first half.
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Yeah.
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
It's him, not it!
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
When did I try to give you money?
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
The Celtics.
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Oh, me too!
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Well, we certainly are alone.
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Oh my God, what's goin' on?
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
I like her so much!
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Really?
No freakshow, she's fictional.
Thank you.
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
I don't even know how I would go about it.
Oh, please!
Hey, how you doin'?
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Thank you.
But are you sure you can do this?
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Hiya!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Yeah, I've been around.
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Great! Problem solved!
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Huh?!
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Could we be more white trash?
How desperate am I?
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Hello everybody!
Hi!
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
What?
Okay.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
All right, you have yourself a deal.
Okay. See?! I told ya!
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
What happened?
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
This body?
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
I don't want to, I'm scared.
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Who are you talking too?
Why?! What happened?!
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
What-what is it, what is it?
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
I think so.
I can do that for the kids.
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Okay. Have a benefit.
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Is there something wrong?
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Well, only if you order stuff.
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
She's a woman!
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
... And where's this money coming from?
What kind of research?
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Ross! They're gonna kill you!
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
No!
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Yes have you seen any?
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Of course.
Oh. Then, no.
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
What award are you practicing for?
Grammy, Best New Artist.
Ohh that's great!
Yeah!
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Things change, roll with em.
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
I'm sorry. See ya.
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
I can't believe this Chandler!
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Oh, well I'm uh...
Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. .
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Yeah.
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Okay.
Oh God!
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
What's going on?
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
Sure, now I'm scared.
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
With a man?
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Five.
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Pheebs!
Hey!
Yeah!
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
Fine with me!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
No it is not!
What are you talking...
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
A woman in a man's body.
Much better.
Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
Yeah, little Eric.
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
No.
Well, here it is.
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
It's not on my head.
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
I'm wearing two belts.
Are you drunk?
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
Look I want you, now.
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Joey, no means no!
Hey!
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
No.
Yes.
Thanks man.
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Uh, what was that?
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
Well, I guess that's it.
Why, what happened?
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
Who was that?
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Seven hundred bucks!
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
Ok.

Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
Could've been a peach.
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Really?
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Oh. Right.
Hell no, we'll pay!
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
"You have two new messages."
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
No! I'm putting that in my room.
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Five years.
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
Aw, I love that.
You guys!
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
3, 2,
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
Well, you just...
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
You guys! You guys!
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Oh God, no.
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
He's talking to London!
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Well, can you dance at all?
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Well try to keep it down.
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
And say nothing?
Uh-huh, yeah that's right.
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
What? You mean behind my back?
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
We were just talking about you.
Really?!
Right in there!
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
That is true.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Congratulations!
Oh that's great!
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
So uhh, you ready?
Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that?
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
What, you don't think I know that?
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
That was you!
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
No! Joey!
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
An egg?
I think it's winning.
I think it's insane.
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Uhh, the ball thing.
Yeah?
Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Okay!
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
Hey! What's going on?
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
You have been maid of honor before?!!
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
Okay.
Joey Tribbiani, this is...
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
How do you do there, Wayne?
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Wow! Sure! That's great!
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
So...What?
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Really? Right across the street?
Yeah!
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Yeah I did!
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
You got porn!
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
Thanks.
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
Where is she?
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Thank you.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
Hm-mm, corn beef.
Okay.
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
COME ON!!!!
Y'know what? We need to move on.
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Uh-oh, busted!
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
Is that what I want?
Yes.
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Lemonade? You ok man?
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
I fell down an elevator shaft.
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
And of course, crotchless panties.
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Six months.
Not if I get there first.
Ohhh, man!!
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
We did?
Yeah, right.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Say what?
I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
Oh that was a real person?!
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
Yeah, I understand.
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
What is this? What's going on?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
What-what are you talking about?!
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Yeah, they're not coming.
What?!
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
In this life, Phoebe.
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
That's a good point.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
What's up man?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Alright, somebody.
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Hey!
Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
Really?
Oww!
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Yay!
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
It's creamier.
Yeah, well, is that better?
My God! What happened to you?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
I'm...happy...for you?
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Yeah, we are so sorry.
You're kinda stepping on the song.
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
Joey was in a porno movie.
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Alright. Cab driver number two?
You're welcome.
Things change, roll with em.
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
Oooh.
Yeah, Ginger something.
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
No! No-no-no...
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Rach, these are for you.
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Picture? What picture?
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
Oh, thanks.
But you're spittin' all over me man!
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
Man, this is...
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
Oh, he sees her!
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
But it's $2,000.
Sorry.
We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Oh-I don't know.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
Hey.
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
What were you modeling for?
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
That's patio furniture!
What about the birds?
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
Come on.
That was pretty intense huh?
I hope he did!
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Hey!
Hey!
You let Joey drive it?!
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
The wedding starts at six.
You'll vamp?!
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Ah, finally an explanation.
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
Wow!
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Oooo-ooh!
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
This is not good for my rage.
Monica, is this true?
Yes it's true.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
These little women. Wow!
Your liking it, huh?
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
Please!!
No, not getting my bra!
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Okay.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
I highly doubt that.
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Who the hell are you?!
I'm Joey! How are you doin'?!
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Who the hell is Carl?!
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
No!
So what happened?
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
Yeah, totally!
Feel better now?
Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
I am so sorry.
I know that too.
Hey!
Hi.
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
No I-I-I'm fine.
All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
And that's how you bought it?
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call.
Oh.
Or... Dick.
Hey.
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
Well that's not true.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
You do?
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
Well then maybe I will.
Fine with me.
Who's drink can I freshen?
Almost time for cake.
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
What kinda stuff?
You cook naked?
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Yeah. So?
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Well, may I ask for one example?
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
Who was that?
Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
Whoa, she's pretty.
I'm sorry, what?
What?
Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!
What's the part?
Come on! That's great.
Wow!
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Oh yeah!
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
All right.
All right.
Hey man.
What is up?
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
You?
Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
Well, my goodness, what was that?
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
No-no-no-no-no we came together!
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
Really, y'think so? I don't..
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!
So?
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
Yeah?
How you doin'?
I can't help it!
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Really?
No.
Noooo!!
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Halftime.
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Oh no! An asteroid!
Um-mm.
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
Did I not just tell him?
Yes, you did.
It's not all juice!
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
You guys.
Oh, God.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
So, you'd hire me, right?
For what?
Huh? What?
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
Ooh!
Okay!
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
It's not my first time.
I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Why are they here?
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
Yeah!
I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Pop it in.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
What's wrong with people having sex?
Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
Hey!
But those are the words! Those exact words!
Hey!
Hey!
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Hi!
Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Oooo-ooh!
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Jeez, what a baby.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Well there you go.
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay, these things happen.
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Bye!
Bye!
Dude! How come you took off?
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Huh.
What?
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
Hmmm, that's very cool.
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
Yeah, that was real.
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Quick volleyball question.
Volleyball.
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Dennis.
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Yeah! She's right in there!
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
I'm gettin' my chair back!
What? Wh-hey!
Joey you broke my chair!!
Your chair?!
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
How do you not fall down more?
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
Lovely, just lovely.
Really? Thanks.
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
I know.
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Me and Chandler?!
Uh-hmm.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Hey, what time is it?
2:17.
Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Yeah! You wanna come?
Yeah!
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
A pharmacist.
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
I was tired!
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
It was.
Those were like the best seats ever.
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
Oh. Oh, God!
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
Great. Great.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Why would you think that?
Everybody has to audition.
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
So, uh, how often can you do it?
As much as he needs.
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
Yeah, I forget which ones.
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Hey, you guys...
Hey!
Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Oh no! An asteroid!
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Yeah?
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Hey.
Hey.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
Cool.
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Waaa-aaah.
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
Joey, I really don't...
Can you tell me how this happened?
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
Hey Terry!
Good to see you again!
It's a different building.
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Ok, this could be tough.
Ooh, you almost had it.
No no, you're fine, you're fine.
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Hello!
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
I know.
What's up Joe?
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
No thank you.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
Congratulations!
Uh-huh.
So uh, which one is mine?
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Why?
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
So you're really okay with this?
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
You want some help.
No help required Chico.
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
What?
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
I don't know!
Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
No they didn't!
Hey!
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Thank you.
Of course.
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Really?! Well, when?
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
What's a Movement class?
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
I like it!
Eh? We'll show him!
Hi. I'm back.
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
What?
What?
Oh my god!
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
I'll try.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
I don't know, clean places?
Umm, yum!
Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
Okay, good luck!
Hey!
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Wait a second, I could star in it!
Or that.
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
What is the thing?
What?
They were in his office.
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
Oh!
Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
They don't look any bigger than me!
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
I think it was valued at 19,000
Joey! Joey, good one!
That's good. Very good!
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Okay.
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
What?!
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Well you don't.
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Pheebs, I was wondering...
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
No!
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
What are you guys gonna do?
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
Yeah, well, it feels different.
It's dry.
No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Everybody has to audition.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Oh, ok.
Is she gonna be all right?
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Oh.. oh... oh.
Well, this has been fun.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
No, I just think Monica was that fat.
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
I am pretending.
Well then, do it better!
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
I don't need that anymore.
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Okay.
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
I know...
Really?
Pheebs?
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
Dude, they're not objects.
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
We know!
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
Oh, yeah.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
What do ya say? What do ya say?
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Nothing, why?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Stop it!
Please stop it!
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Hey, dude!
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Sorry.
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Hello!
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
Wh-what?!
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Why not?!
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
There is no father.
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
Joey...
What's the part, Anti-man?
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
Hey!
Hey!
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
What?
Y'know, all the women.
I'm right here!
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
How?
Again I must go back to, how?
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
No you won't.
No we won't.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Go!!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Yes. Yes!
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Hey!
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Well, I'd have to say gay.
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
I-I-I don't know.
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Umm, no thank you.
What's with her?
Okay.
What do you like better action or comedy?
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Are you serious?!
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
What is DOOL?
Oh!!
That's great!
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
Yeah.
Nice shades.
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
Yeah?
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
I know!
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
You're right.
Yeah!
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
You won't boss me around anymore?
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Yeah.
Well, now we got a reason.
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
That makes more sense.
So, what's going on now?
Whaddya see?
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
We'll see.
Well, thank you for lunch.
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
Oh.
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Thanks!
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Well, you're amazing.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Don't do it.
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
Nice to meet ya.
At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo.
Wow.
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
Yes! Well that-yes.
Why else would we be here?
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Thanks, man, big help.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Joey!!
The green dress? Really?
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Please be kidding.
OK. I'm in my apartment...
....yeah... what else?
Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
I do NOT want this unit!!
Fine!
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
How did you? How? How?
Hey!
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
There's an ad for a naked chef?
Hi.
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
Rings?
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
I love you. And I know about the baby.
What baby?
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Maybe, because you told him not to.
What are you the memory woman?
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
What?!
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Noooo.
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
We could climb Mt. Everest!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
Yeah!
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
What?
All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
What, you don't think I know that?
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
What?
He's gonna eat the cake!
Oh yeah.
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Ohh-oh, chilling!
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Really?
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Whoa, she's pretty.
I'm sorry, what?
What?
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
Really?
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
That's okay, Joe.
All right, let's go Pheebs.
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
No! I'm up for a Soapie!
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
What are you talking about?
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
Take 36 is up!
All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?
Uh sure.
Okay.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Whoa!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Wow!
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
That makes more sense.
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
BEND OVER?!!!
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
Oh my God!
There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
What's the matter?
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
You don't like puppies?
Okay, you are new!
You don't like ice cream?
It's too cold.
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Yes that would be lovely.
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
We're sorry honey.
Oh, it's okay.
And heels.
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Well, there you go.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Look, what do you want me to say?
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Oh man!!
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
They're not a couple!
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Oh yeah!
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
Ha!
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Tequila!!
That's fun.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
You're building a post office?
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
Ok, this could be tough.
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Need a new table.
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
There are?
Yeah! Richard!
That's right.
Chandler loves marriage!!
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
How you doin there squirmy?
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
I have nothing to do with casting.
So what're you guys gonna eat?
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
Yeah, of course, Donald.
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Chandler!
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
I see where you're goin'!
What's up with the greed Joe?
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Well, the duck...
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Y'know-y'know what I really want?
What?
Any progress?
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
They don't have those.
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
Ohhh, yeah!
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
What are you talking about?
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Okay!
All right!
Hey!
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Yeah?
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
So... and?
Allright!
Alright... I've got to go shower.
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Yeah.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
Hi!
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Ooooh, nice.
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
That is sooo not true!
What?
I can check that for ya.
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Whoa!
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Since when?
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Hi!
Hey!
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
No!
There you go. Thank you!
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
Hey you guys.
Hey Joe what's up?
I can see why that's hard to resist.
I like her so much!
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Hey, it's Janice.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
Y'know I think you can take her.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
Christmas cookie?
Looks good. I'll take it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
You're right, you're right, it is.
Yes.
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
I can't believe she cracked your code!
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Eh. Beth dies.
Beth, Beth dies?
Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
So did you ask him?
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
Hey.
Hi.
About what?
Y'know, about what happened with us.
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
Where do I know you from?
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
Tribbiani.
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
She's not much of a phone person.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Alright...
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
What?
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Yeah!
Are you guys sure about this?
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Let me see. Oh, right.
When did you go to a sperm bank?
And that's how you bought it?
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
Why? What happened now?
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
Damnit!! Did you move?!
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
So what are you gonna be?
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Hey.
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
Well there you go.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Okay.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
All right, then show me some manly moves.
All right.
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
Sorry Phoebs.
Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Maybe he's. . . gay.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
You know what makes the itching even worse?
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
What?!
What?!
This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
Yes!
All right.
It's 6:00.
Yeah, well...
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
Not on you! On the stripper!
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
Yeah, okay.
What trail?
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
Blah?!
Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
I guess.
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Okay. I am so hot!
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
The only problem!
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Uh-huh.
Okay...
Give me $400!
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Right.
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
I'm right here!
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
I'm still right here!
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
What are you guys woofing about?
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
You want my advice?
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Yeah, right!
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
Hey Mon!
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
You're not on TV.
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Oh my God!
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Come on Joey!!!
I can't believe you would say that!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Thanks.
You got waaaay too much free time.
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Oh, hey!
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
I'm out.
He painted that.
Let's see, ahhh... Where does the Pope live?
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Who the hell is Carl?!
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
You're kidding.
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
Well then let me do it!
Joe...
Joey look it's really sweet...
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Please stop it!
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
God! What are you, in second grade?
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
What?
We're just friends.
What four of us?
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
What?
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Well, you just...
What?!
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Does anybody need anything?
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
Well, it is overdue.
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Well I just thought...
It's a curling iron.
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Wow! Sure! That's great!
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
They'll never understand!
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
Oh my God!!
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Sure. So how long you been...
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
I'm having surgery!
What?!
What kind of surgery?!
Transplant.
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
Isn't that a line from the show?!
That's a line from the show too!
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Hi, how are ya?
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
No, no, this is the first time.
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
Well, let me see.
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
No! Why?
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
Why don't you open with a joke?
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
H-He's in China!
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
What kinda change?
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
Mornin'.
Your territory, huh?
Yeah. Bijan for men?
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Ohh, that's a good one.
Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
My mom will.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
You can tell us.
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Ok.
I hear ya.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
With Carol? Oh.
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Uh-huh.
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
I don't know, I don't know.
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
Oh that's too bad.
Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.
'Kay!
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
Sorry!
Okay, okay, you got it!
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
What?!
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Ready, Annabelle?
You bet. Maybe some other time?
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
Yeah.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
Hello!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Joey, I saw you push him!
You pushed him!
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
What?
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
There is not one hair on that head.
Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
Yeah.
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Okay, Chandler, come on!
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
No, Janice.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
So was I.
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Yeah you did.
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Hey! Are you okay?
Fabulous.
Become a drama critic!
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
Well, we could do that!
There's other stuff too.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
Huh?!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
I've got cold feet.
...it's gonna be okay!
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
Yeah?
Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Ok.
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Why?
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
I'll be there.
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
Let's get out of here.
The one time they're not home.
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
She's comin'.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
It looks like a women's purse.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
Exactly! Unisex!
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Then you do. Heh, heh.
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
What a pity stay?
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
Joey that is so sweet.
Hey.
I couldn't do it.
You couldn't do it?!
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Hey!
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
I don't want to do that.
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
What am I doing?
Well, it is overdue.
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
The fear?
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Your what?
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Well, it does.
Okay, you wore me down.
Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
This is Janice.
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
I'm not breaking up with her!
God, look what I found in the drain.
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
And last but not least.
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Hiiiiii.
Are... are you OK?
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
We are bad people.
Hey, ready for dinner?
Ooh, absolutely!
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
Oh My God.
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Hi everyone.
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
That had to hurt!
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
Come on, tell me.
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Come on, take 'em off!!
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
I helped!
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
What, like there's a rule or something?
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
Y'know I think you can take her.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Whadja think?
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Saw your head. Saw your head.
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
He paid a lot of money for it.
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Yeah?
Yeah?
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Interesting.
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Huh. A moo-point?
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Oh.
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Oh.
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
That's a hernia.
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
You're in this picture?
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Good idea! Yes!
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
No. No, Kathy.
Consider Casey.
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Hey!
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Did I squeeze it too hard?
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
Aww...
Big day.
You know he's gay?
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
Thanks!
I know.
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
What code?
What are you guys doing out here?
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
Bastard!
Hey!
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
What?!
I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
No.
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
You're in this picture?
Joey, right?
Yeah.
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Joey, please.
Wow.
Alright, now you say something.
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
This is like the temporary robot, right?
No. Why?
I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
I do not hate Ross!
What picture?
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Yeah! Punch him!!
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
So what. I say, punch him.
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Chandler? A word.
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Yeah?
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
For Ross.
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Wait a second, I could star in it!
Or that.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
Oh-oh, absolutely!
It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
Oh, yeah!
That commercial always makes me so sad.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
This took you all day?!
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Hey.
Do you have any ice?
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
Two.
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Oh.
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
How are you feeling?
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
You know, I think I might just.
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
I ran!!
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and...
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
No.
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
I'm sorry.
Joey, onstage!
Where are you Vic?
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
That's what you say about porn.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
What's going on over here?
What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
So...
Absolutely!
I'll see you at 8:00.
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Oh that's great!
Ugh, PBS!
What's wrong with PBS?
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
That's weird.
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Yeah.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
You got married again.
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Oh, my.
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
What?
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Well, what did you do?
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
Can I help you?
Uh-oh.
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
Okay, that hurt us.
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
OH YES!!!!!
Strip Happy Days Game?
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Yeah! Come on.
Awww...
Left.
Damnit!
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
Ohh.
Really?! How come?
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Really? Who-who have you taught?
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
Well, it involved Monica.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
What was the dream about?
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Sure?
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
I can't take any...
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
You don't have any secrets!
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
You want to see her again, right?
Sure.
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
The show?!
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
Doesn't matter.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
You're all invited to bite me!
He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
That's me.
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
Really.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
You still can't stand her can you?
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Something like that?
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
It's the Knicks!
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
God. I feel violated.
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
No, you should.
Now, don't argue with me...
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
What?
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Ohhh, here it comes.
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
You're jokin' right?
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Oh don't even ask!
Yuck!
That was like 5 years ago.
Yeah you got 5 years left!
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Hey! How you doin'?
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Right! And when is that due?
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
What is it?
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
Hey, kids.
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Oh uh, when?
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Joey... Switzerland?
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
Yes!
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
No, not us... Us!
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
Really? Why?
Hoyt?
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
We'll watch him.
I don't think tho.
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
That'll be $3.85.
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
Amy!
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What?
What? So you never went out with an actress before?
Kate, do you even like me?
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
Hey.
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
So'd you guys have fun?
Your boyfriend is so cool.
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
All right, so we weren't prepared!
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Hey.
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Thanks!
So, you busy Thursday?
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Hey! Hi!
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Well, I'm going to kill you.
Why?
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Oh yeah? That's great!
Aahhuuhhh....
Hey.
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
Yeah!
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
I don't know! Yeah, I do.
Joey!
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Oh no! No! No!
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Oh no, yeah.
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
So uh, what are you guys doing?
Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
We're so sorry.
Yeah.
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
Joey look it's really sweet...
That is true.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
Oh, what the hell is that?
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
I got it! Here we go.
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
What? What?
They tore it down a few days early.
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
Really? To what?
You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
He's got the body for it.
I like that. What?
We do not have one of those signs.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Hey!
Yes that was mine.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
What difference does that make?!
Joey, do you have a minute?
Dude, what am I gonna...
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
No.
Okay. Well, you be careful.
Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
We're so sorry.
Yeah.
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
That sounds great. Same for me.
And for the gentleman?
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Huh.
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
That's still in there?!
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
Man, do you know what guys want!
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Shoot.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
You're so pretty.
Hi!
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Whoa ho.
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Sure.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
What trail?
Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
As crazy as soccer?
You mean you didn't get it from this?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
Sucker!
Hello? Hey Joey!
Sure! Where is it?
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Ahh.
What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
What?
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Let's take it from there.
Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Thank you. Thank you.
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
Yes.
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Not once did we do that.
Hi.
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
The shipment never made it through Omaha?
Hi, you guys.
Hey!
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Well I like both eggs equally.
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
You got waaaay too much free time.
Happy birthday, pal!
We love you, man.
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
Whoa ho.
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
Bye.
Bye.
I am so glad you said cooks.
I know.
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
What?!
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
Hey.
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
A mirror?
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
Yeah, totally!
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
Amazingly, that makes sense.
You think?
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
Like a goalie, right?
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Huh?
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Oh man!
Unless...
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Again I must go back to, how?
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
Rachel has those in burgendy.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What? Ow!
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Sorry, that was wax.
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Sorry.
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
Oh, that's true.
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Good enough to get fired.
All right, you're hired!
Yes.
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Iced tea.
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
You got me. I don't...
Joey!
Ross's parents are my parents!
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
What?!
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
Uh-oh.
Is there a problem?
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Oh, what did I say?
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Time is money my friend?
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Really? That's great!
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Do you two know each other?
No. No.
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
In 1981 you were 13!
Okay, she can't go.
Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
What?
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
What gay thing?
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
Oh My God.
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Or not.
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
I paid for those tickets!
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
What?
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
We've got a box.
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Ok.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
Oh right, right.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Pheebs?
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Oh yeah, come here.
Oh, that's mature.
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
Joey, you have got to take this back!
No! Joey!
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
I've been back and forth.
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
That's all you're basing this on?
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Oh my God!!
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
They have the best stuff in there.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Why?! What happened?!
I'm so sorry.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Hey, I've been married 3 times
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
Hey, stripper!
What?
The ring is gone!
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
Thanks.
While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Hi!
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
Ok.
Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
Hey pal.
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
The next, next?
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
They loved me!
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
All right.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Uh, boat rope.
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Hmm?
I think it's important that you do.
So what's your name?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
Oh my... God?
So, what're you gonna do?
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Can you believe this place?
I know, this is a great apartment.
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Hey.
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
He's talking to London!
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
I got fired.
Oh!
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
My mom will.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Hey!
Hey.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Why are you doing this?
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Her dancer friends?
Dude, we were good!
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
What? A brain transplant?!
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
When did that happen to you?!
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
Me too.
Yeah?
Hey!
Sh-shh-shh!
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Oh!
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do. How you doin?
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Joey...
Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
Oh!
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Yeah.
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Ah, we'll all go. Come on.
Thanks you guys! Thank you.
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Why?
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Still broken?
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Nah, not my game.
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Okay!
Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Yep!
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
What a minute, what did he say?
What?! You got us evicted!!
I told you not to go down there!
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Yeah?
What are you saying?
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Hellooo!
Hey.
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Okay, Phoebe...
Yes! Your honor?
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Oh!
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Well... not in the same way...
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Hey.
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
How often do you read it?
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
But that's what...
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
You're so welcome.
Is that supposed to be me?
Yeah.
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
So, there was no miracle?!
No Joe, no miracle.
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
I think I should get the chair!
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Joey that is so sweet.
Hey.
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out.
I hate this game!
OK Joey, your bet.
Ross?
Oh, I am very in.
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
We owe you?!
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Morning. Good morning.
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Whoooaa!
That's my sister.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Pheebs, what about you?
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
Okay .
Here you go.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
I'm in it.
This is terrible, what are you going to do?
That's not good.
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
You wanna play?
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
I'm, I'm okay. See.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
They actually said that?
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Oh.
Yeah, no, I understand.
You do, thanks.
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
No. I'm all alone.
Daddy!!
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
MY SANDWICH?!!!
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
My God Monica!!
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
That makes sense!
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Hey, that was really good!
Thanks! Let's keep going.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
No, I just thought it was cute.
Ohh. Like what?
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Yeah it is. . . what?
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
Who's they?
No one.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.
No.
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
You got a Cheeto on your face man.
Hi.
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Thank you so much.
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Hey.
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Noo! Nothing!
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
So I can do it?
Yeah you can do it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Oh! My hero! What happened?
What a minute, what did he say?
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
Good for you.
So... and?
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Not if you're gonna be like this!
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Uh-huh.
Hmm?
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!

What's wrong?
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Well did you try calling her?
Hey.
Oh!
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
I know. I know.
Feel better?
Yeah, I understand.
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?
Exactly.
No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
No.
Yeah, okay.
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
Joey, why is your cable out?
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
It's not charity, Joe...
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
His dancing partner?!
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Hey.
Hey.
The show?!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Hey, dude!
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
No! No! No!
They're in my bag over there.
Ah.
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
It's uh, right through there.
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Well, what did you do?
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Okay...
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
Put it on.
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
I so am.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
I hate this thing!
Oh, hi Danny.
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Well that's how I feel.
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Shhhh!
What are you shushing?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
I sort've already asked Chandler.
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
Hey Joey.
No, I just thought it was cute.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
...I'm his
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
Oh my God.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
OH.....MY.....GOD!!
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Did not, she did not wink at you....
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Well I just thought...
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
Scene 5, take 1.
And Action!
Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
Okay.
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Love what you've done with the place.
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Oh yeah!
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Yeah, that'd be cool!
Pete's breaking up with me.
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Okay.
Okay.
Not great.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Great, now he's waving back.
What kinda stuff?
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Huh? What?
It's my joke.
It's my joke.
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Well... It's a date.
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
No.
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
Not a problem.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
She's not much of a phone person.
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Come on. I want to know.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Oh that was a real person?!
I-I-I'm leaving the show?
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Here you go.
Thank you.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
Yeah, you're on your own.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
You guys don't think I look 19?
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
God. I feel violated.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
Oh.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
That's a really long time.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Good luck.
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Ohhhh man
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Monica, leave him alone!
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Do you two know each other?
No. No.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Yeah, thanks.
Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
Joey.
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Oh, I'm sorry what?
So...
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
Oh.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Well, I guess that's something.
Okay.
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Ross! Janice?!
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
So are you actually gonna see her again?
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Yeah right!
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
What you do mean?
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
As crazy as soccer?
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
What?
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
You don't have, anything?
Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
About Ross!
Oh! Oh!
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Ohhhhh!
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
And now for the great news.
What, that wasn't the great news?
Christmas cookie?
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
My god, what happened?
Sure.
So.
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
What the hell happened on that beach?!
It's between us and the sea, Ross!
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Thanks!
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
So Joey, you okay?
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Sorry.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
What?!
My-Oh my God!
I know! They suck!!
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Sorry!
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
She's not even cold yet!
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
Is she gonna be all right?
Nice!
That's great!
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
You stink!
Are you kidding?!
He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
Hey buddy! How's it going?
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
How come you are?!
Because I cared enough to lie!
What are you talking about?
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Where do you work?
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
Hey! Terry.
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
I can't help you Joey.
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Why?
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh, I don't know.
You mean with Casey.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
Y'know, about what happened with us.
Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Nooo.
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
That sounds fair.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
So, what do you thing the good news is?
Oh my.
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
Oh my God!
Wow!
Oh, I love that guy!
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
What about my cab?
I don't need that anymore.
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
I've never done that.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Really?! You think that will work?
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Fine!
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Eh! There you go.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
No, that was clenching.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, you're on.
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Wow.
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
Um-hum.
This man is my God.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
You did look like an idiot.
Yeah that's the same.
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Joey, the guy's your best friend.
Oh, who? Me?
Yeah!
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
The only problem!
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Sure! What's up?
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
Do you want me to want you to care?
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Okay. Okay.
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
So what are you guys out doing today?
You done?
Yeah.
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
Wow!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
Oh no, you'll have to come.
Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
And tell him what?
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Great. Great.
I'll be there.
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Hi!
Hi!
Great!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
You're not his godfather.
What?! Are you kidding?!
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Oh Joey!
No she hasn't.
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Hey, where you been?
Score.
She is so hot!
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Great! Roomie!
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Now calm down Joey.
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Not broad backed!
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
So, you and Angela, huh?
Yep. Pretty much.
Huh, I never really noticed.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
Yeah, kinda.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
I have a question about this scene.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
Well, that was ah...
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Who?
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
I can't help you Joey.
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Uh, we might be leaving now.
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Uh-huh.
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Yes!
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
You serious?
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Come on man, really how old?!
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Are you gonna go over there?
Joey.
You look good.
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Look, what do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you like her!
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Hey, Paul!
Yeah?
Shut up, Joey!
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
Here you go.
Oh.
All the time?
All the time!
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
Oh, you should here me.
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
They don't have those.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
Hey dude, it's me.
Hey it's Joey!
What?
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
From a bullet!
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Yeah I guess you're right.
Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
That's because all people are selfish.
Are you calling me selfish?!
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Hello.
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
Got it! So...
So uh, do you live around here?
I'll remember that.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
She was a welder.
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
It's not Christmas!
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
You bought boobs?
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
Ready, Annabelle?
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Wow! That is a bad audition.
How-how did you lose your job here?
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
I am your friend.
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Hey guys.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
See you later Mon.
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Nothing?
I have to get back to...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Oh.
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
What was the dream about?
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
It-it doesn't?
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
The ring is gone!
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
You slept with the stripper?
Of course!!
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Oh, yay!
Oh.
Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. You Miss Geller?
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
What?!
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Oh.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
Let me see that!
All right.
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Whatever.
Fine.
Phoebe!
Secret affair!
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Probably because...
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
What?
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Woooo!!!
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
Marry me.
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
Well, do you see any babies?
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Great!! That's great!
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Good luck!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
What happened?
Why can't you tell her?
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Yeah.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Multiple orgasms!
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
So, we're having fun, right?
Yeah.
I'm kinda beat.
Actually, me too.
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
As in Rosita does not move.
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
Stevie the TV?
Is there a problem?
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
We're back on.
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
Ugh!!
What happened?
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
Oh my.
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
I'll do it.
Okay, absolutely!
All right.
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Wow. He's strict.
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Hey no problem.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Welcome home man.
A little foos?
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
Ok, that's Eric.
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
Yeah.
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
It doesn't say that in the script.
It does in mine!
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
What?
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Monica? You're Mom.
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Oh my God! Whoah!
Well, what's the part?
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
My identical hand twin!
What's an identical hand twin?
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Hi. She said yes.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Cache? Jaunty?
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
There you go!
"...by doin' it."
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
That's great.
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
All right.
All right.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
Oh my God! Whoah!
Well, what's the part?
Seriously, what-what's the part?
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Thanks.
You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you're just so, you're so, so...
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
What?
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
You're turning into a women.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
I just hope...
You can let some of them go by!
Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Okay.
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
Yeah.
Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. .
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Did I get it?
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
"...by doin' it."
Joe?
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Yeah!! I call that London style.
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Can I ask you something?
Uhh, no.
No.
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
What equity investments?
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Wh-what do you mean?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
OOooooo!
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
What's in it?
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Your different here too. Your mean in England.
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
You left a shoe here?!
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Great! Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
Hey! So I'm back.
Who are you?
Show me in the table.
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don't hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Well, hello Rachel!
Have you really done this before?
Hey!
Hey-hey-hey!
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Really. What?
Why the Post?
Oh, you didn't see the Post?
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
..Naughty!
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Why don't you just take it with you?
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Okay!
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Yeah, I know!!!!
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Hey!
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Whaddya see?
You okay, kiddo?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Crazy bitch.
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Hey.
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
Hey!
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
Nice work my friend.
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
What? What?
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
Hey buddy! How's it going?
Hey!
Hey!
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
We could get that Everest video though.
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
Oh, well...
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Hey.
Hey, man. What's up?
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
Alrighty, here come the water works.
Hey guys!
Hey!
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Come where?
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Okay man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
I know!
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Who are you talking too?
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
What's Phase Two?
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
No I don't think so.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
And yet, we're still poking him.
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
You think I need a new walk?
What?
Are you actually saying these words?
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
No, 10 is the highest.
Why is 10 the highest?
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Okay.
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Well, I guess that's something.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
No, the quiet down thing!
You mean this.
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
And why wouldn't he get it?
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
You just give him a spoon baby!
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
How is that important?
Oh it's important!
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Thank you, Joey.
No-no, thank you.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
I'm not answering that.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Hi!
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
We've got a problem.
Tell me.
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
What?
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
What?! Tonight?!
That's what Monica said.
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
It's a woman.
So talk to her.
Why the voice.
Hard to say.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
I figure my character has kids.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
No! No-no-no...
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
Well ah, what can you swing?
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
What kinda things have you been saying?
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
I'll be waiting.
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
It's a curling iron.
It's clean.
Yeah, well, it feels different.
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
Psss, that is whack!
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
Wouldn't she?
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
Hey there you are!
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
You realize what you are don't you?
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Please be kidding.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
Then what's the problem?
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
Hey, what did your agent say?
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Wow, he must like you the best.
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
No problem. Hey Chandler
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Needs some clothes altered?
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
Bye Phoebe.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
I can scratch that right off.
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
What, now?
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Okay, we owe you a present.
Two! I've been engaged twice!
That is the Coast Guard.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
Hey, what did your agent say?
What, forget it!
Yeah, right.
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Is all this true?
Oh Hans.
Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Oh, ok.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
How come it's not mixing with the water?
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
Ok.
No.
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
What?
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
I made fun of his accent.
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
All right, you got it.
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
Yeah.
Y'know which one was she again?
It's gotta be the first one.
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt.
Oh, thanks!
Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
Yeah!
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Thank you.
Okay.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
That's very nice.
That's sweet, Joey.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
I don't know, I don't know.
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
You got me.
Yeah. Right.
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
He's not here right now.
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
What's the matter?
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
I've never seen it!
Oh you should, it's great.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
But we don't know the neighbors.
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
That's what you got me?
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Joey.
Yeah?
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Well there you have it!
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Friends first? That's interesting.
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
I made them!
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
The wedding starts at six.
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Okay.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
I'm sorry, what?
What?
Oh, ok.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Hmmm, that's very cool.
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
I can't believe she cracked your code!
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.
What happened?
Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
Oh my God.
OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Got it!
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
I don't know.
Okay!
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
That's sweet, Joey.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Well, what am I going to say?
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Great!
I can do that.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!
That's right!
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Oh no!
I'm comin' out!
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
What?
Five oh dollars.
That's great.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
That's not a question.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
... It's a fertility study.
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Hey.
Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
Hello.
Hey!
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
Chandler?
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
I do.
I do.
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
They actually said that?
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
We owe you?!
We didn't give you any money!
You don't think I know that!
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Yeah. O-okay.
How about receiving?
Yes!
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Really?
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
What?!
What's wrong with you?
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
That's right.
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
All right, see ya Pheebs.
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
What?!
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
What's up?
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
That's why you broke up with me?
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
Really?! I won!
What?!
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
Yeah, I remember.
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
You'll vamp?!
How can you not remember us kissing?!
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
What was it for?
The next, next?
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Well, there you go.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Is there something wrong?
Joey...
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
Hey, Pheebs?
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Uh-huh!
Wow! Cool!
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
I didn't know you had another level.
I know! Neither did I!
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
No.
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Borrow money from me?
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
I had a donut.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Okay.
Sorry.
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
So what happens next?
God that is good TV.
Phoebs, play with meeee.
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
That-that is a good trick.
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
Your other student, was you!
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
Where's Mary-Angela?
She's right in there.
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
Okay, fine.
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
You wanna share it?
Okay!!
It's not mayonnaise!!
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Probably because...
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
Yay!!
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Hey!
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Your make-up!
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Oh yeah, no problem.
Thanks.
Joey!
Ross!
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
That is true.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
It might be kinda cool.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
That's the whole part?
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Hi!
So how was, how was your date?
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Hi!
Hey! Hiya!
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
So what, we just sit?
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Rachel! You okay?
Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
I'm having surgery!
Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
No.
Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
What we did last night was....
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
Wow!
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
You think I'm hot?
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
What? Me having a job?
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Really?
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
It's not what you think, that was...
You told me I was the only one.
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
Somebody wanna help me out here?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Didn't you sleep together?
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
Okay.
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
What?!
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
I see where you're goin'!
What's up with the greed Joe?
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
You or me?
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
I am sorry, Chandler.
I am sorry, Ross.
This took you all day?!
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Oh, god help us.
What?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Why?
What's going on?
We all hate Emily!
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
It wasn't my decision!
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
You were in a porno?
That is wild.
So what's it shaped like?
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
What?
Cupping.
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
What? That's not? Oh my God.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
And the bunny got away.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
And I would have to say pah-huh.
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
What the hell happened?!
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
What equity investments?
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
You don't even have a car!
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
Anything but stew.
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
What if Joey were president?
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
I did, but that was really fun.
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
The Bible?!
I don't know!
Diverse.
Did anybody call for security?
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
What?! Why?!
What about the closeness?
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Hey, guys!
Hey!
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
You do, huh?
What are you talking about?
I'm not sure.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Ewwww!!
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Joey, you had the night!
What?
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
What are you talking about?!
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Marcel?
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Ah, finally an explanation.
Joey!
Yeah?
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
Well.
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
Oh yeah.
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie...
Joey, this is awkward part.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
No.
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
So it's okay to date a student.
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
And a date with a man!
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Isn't this great?
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
Come on man, you're not a potato.
I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.
Yeah!
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Hey!
Hey.
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
Help! Help!
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Ooh, I look good.
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
You gave her food poisoning!?
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Oh yeah!
Really?
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
That's crazy.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
You gave her food poisoning!?
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
I have to get back to...
That's okay.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Wow.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
It's open! Come in!
Hi!
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Ohh! A man with a plan!
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Hey! So I'm back.
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
All I say is, she better get the job.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Nice work my friend.
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
When did I try to give you money?
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
It was a dry day.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
All right, be my guest.
Good luck.
Oh, I got it.
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
Hi.
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
Great!
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
So how you two gettin' along?
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
There's another carton right over there.
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Hey, I've been married 3 times
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
It's him, not it!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Oh man!!
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
So she's a woman! So what?
Joey!!
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
Pheebs, I have to ask you...
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
I'm sorry man.
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Well when can we have this shower?
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Ohh-oh, chilling!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
I don't know you guys.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
No, I got him.
No, seriously.
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Uh, Phoebe...
Oh Ross, hi.
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
That's what you should say.
What?
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Sorry.
I'm sorry Joey.
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
So...
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Don't touch him!
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
What a nice story!
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Okay.
Yeah!
Should we call the spitter?
Hey Rachel!
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Amazingly, that makes sense.
You think?
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Stay out of my freezer!
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
In a minute!!
So this is it? Victor?
So long, Vic!
Phoebe, it's been two days.
Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Hi!
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
As are you...
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
He took off?
Go on! Go on.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey-hey.
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
Excellent!
Uh, may I help you?
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
What the?!
Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
