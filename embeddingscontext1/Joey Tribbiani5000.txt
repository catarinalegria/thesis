Ugh.
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Okay.
Urse...
Hi.
Hey.
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Listen, um...
Whoah!
Relax your hand!
Not so much!
Hey!
Hey!
Yeah?!
Two brothers, one died!
Yes!!
Oh!
This is from the woman at the bar.
I like it!
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
That's right!
Eh? We'll show him!
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
I'm Joey.
Boyfriend?
No.
Kristen.
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
I'm him.
He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
That's me.
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
You do?
What's up?
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Yeah.
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Oh, well, that's great!
I can't believe you're getting married!
Yeah.
Yeah! Okay.
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like...
Hey! Hey!
I don't know.
Glad to be of help. Matches.
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Your tax dollars?
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Did I say you could smell it?!
That's right.
Yep.
But you told them you weren't?
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Oh, yeah.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Knick fan?
Oh, boy, do they suck.
Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.
Okay. Okay.
Okay! All right!
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Oh man!
So what-what is the exhibit.
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Hey!
Hi!
Oh yeah.
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
No.
Nooooo.
I guess.
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
Thank you.
If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
That's right!
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Oh Joey!
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!
-Peaches?
Yes, Bunny?
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Could've been a peach.
...Yeah?
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
I'm not a nice guy.
Alright boys, let's eat.
..Naughty!
Yeah?
And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
After!!
After the snap!
Before the snap!
Before!!
Now, does it really matter?
Ahhhhhhhhhh...
Joey, please!
Sorry.
Hello children!
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Ahoy!
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Hey! How's the boat?!
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Alan.
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Althea!
Nana?
She has a real name.
Althea?! What are you doing?!
I took a shot.
Arrrghh!!
No! Come on!
All right!! Fine! Fine.
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
Art.
No.
Wow Joey, this is, uhh...
Art it is.
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Ascot!
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
North route or south route?
North route!
Aw-awww!
It's Pam.
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
I don't think she'd like that.
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
Awwww!
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
Hello?
Surprise!!!
Barmifsaed?
No. What?
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
So to get this part you can't be?
Nope.
Bastard!
Why?
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
Hey!
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.

Blah?!
What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
I don't know, they're just a little blah!
Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
Booo!!
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
Boyfriend?
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
No.

OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...

Dude! How come you took off?
Bye-bye.
Okay, good to see you again.

Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
I love you too.
Charity.
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
Like?
Charity?
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
Check.
Yes, we do.
Alright, check.
I'm in for fifty cents.
Call.
Congratulations.
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
That is amazing.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Cool!!
Hey, are you okay?
My wife's a lesbian.
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
Hi.
Dah!!
Look, we are not gonna...
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Oooooh!
Dawson?!
Yeah, what-what's going on?
Monica had lunch with Richard.
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Definitely!
Yeah!
Are you guys sure about this?
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
All right.
Delicious.
The fruit roll up.
And?

Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
Dude-dude-dude!
Okay.
Okay great.

Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Eddie.
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?
Morning.
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
Erin.
Hey!
Joey.
Hey Rachel.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Feminine.
Are you sure?
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...
Yes!
No!
Fifty-six!
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Wow, how many have you got?
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
Finally!
Yeah?
Do you want some pancakes?
What are we gonna do?
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Freaky.
Freakish.
Wow.
Weird, weird.
Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
Fumble!

Okay. Hut! Hike!
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
G'night.

Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
G-sharp.
Yes! Yes, I did.
Then do Iceberg!
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Goodnight.
Hey.
Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Guest.
Everyday use.
Fancy.
Fancy guest.
Two seconds...
He-he-eyy.
Ok.
There's the man.
Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
Ok. He kept my dollar.
Heads.
You got a better idea?
All right, call it in the air.
Heads it is.
Yes! Whew!
Hey-hey.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Guess what, I got an audition!
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
Hey...
Hey guys!
Hey!
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Heyyy.
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
Hey guys! What's up?
We're hanging out.
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
Hiya.
Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
What is going on here?
Hm-mmm.
Yeah.
Really?!
$4.50 please.
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Hmm.
I'm a man.
Defend yourself.
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Interesting.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
The one with "Heston" on it.
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
No thanks, Mom!
Karen.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Kinda.
Nothing.
You built a fort didn't ya?
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Kristen?
Is your back feeling better?
Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Joey!
Hi!
Lean-lean-lean!
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Enough!
"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"/Happy holidays, everybody!
Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
Lifeguards.
Baywatch.
What's it about?
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Look.
Phoebe?
Joey? What's going on?
Oh my God!
I know! It's stuck!!!
Luck!
That.
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Mar-klan.
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
Margha.
Mar-gha.
Mar-haaaan.
Me?
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Lose the robe.
That would work.
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Miracle!
Can you tell me how this happened?
Well no.
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Someone like an...angel?
Movies?
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
I don't think so.
NO!!!
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
Nah.
Uhh....
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
Phoebe?
That's what I'm saying.
Nana?
It's All Relative.
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
She has a real name.
Althea!
Nice.
Noo!!
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
And the way she slaps all the time!
No-no-no-no-no.
Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
No.
No-o-o!!
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
Really?!
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
Oh! Oh!
Nooo!
No!
That other play?
The movie?
Yes!!
Nooooo.
Oh yeah.
No.
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
Uh-huh, yeah.
Ohh!!
You got your passport?
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
There it is.
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
Ohhh!
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Yes. Yes.
You?! And-and you?!
Ooh-ho-ho!
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
14.
Oooooh!
Dah!!
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Deal!
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
Oooooh...
I don't think she'd like that.
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
I don't think so dear.
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
Ooooohh!
Well, what happened?
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
My God.
Are you sure?
Ooooooh.
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
Oooooh.
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
Or?
Umm, well, what else could it be?
It's kidney stones.
Kidney stones!
All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.
Out.
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Wherere you going?
With?
Yes.
Pastrami.
A little salami.
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Pheebs!!
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Hey!
Yeah?
I found my identical hand twin!
Serious?
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Are you scared?
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Seriously?
Really?
Yes!
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
I'm 30!
Set....hike!
Okay.
Break!!
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
No, no, no, no, no!
Sh-shh-shh!
Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
Hey!
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
Shut-out!!
I'm having a son. Um...
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Sir.
What a phony.
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Six.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
How many guesses do you get?
Challenge extended.
Deal!
So...What?
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
Yes!
Stegosaurus!
Sorry.
It's morphin time!
Tyrannosaurus!
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
Suck-fest.
Wonderful!
So good!
Toootal chick-flick.
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Sure?
It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
Hi!
Surprise!!
Hello?
Surprise!!!
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
Tequila!!
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
That's fun.
Here you go.
Tongue?
Ohhhh.
And, uh, and then I kissed her.
Yeah.
Cool.
Transplant.
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
What kind of surgery?!
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
Hair transplant.
Twice?
So, um, did she...
Twice.
Oh, that sucks!
You guys okay?
U-N-I-sexy?
What's the part, Anti-man?
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Hi sweetie!
Ugh!!
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
What happened?
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
Uh-huh!
Okay! When?!
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
I want to do it again.
Uh.
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
Uh...Cookie?
I think you did.
I think I lost. Three times.
Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
Yeah, sure.
Uhh....
Huh.
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
Nah.
Uhhhh.
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
Um-hmm.
Uh fellas,
Okay, so he's out of here.
Hey!
Hey!
Umm...
Oh uh, one of the writers.
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
Okay.
Umm?
Bye!
Hey, uh, Joey?
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Oh, no!
Vulva?
What?
Um... uh.... vulva.
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
WHAT?!!
Yeah, they still wear underwear.
OH MY GOD!!!
Are you all right?!
Yeah...
WHOAA!!
But, you left the chair area.
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Well?!
Hey.
Hi!
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Wh-why?
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
God I'm just a horrible person.
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Wha-
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Wha-
What is it?
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
What?!?!
Oh, I do. How you doin?
I'm OK
What?
Oh dear God!
Whatever.
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Wheel!
Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
Hey!
Of!
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
Who-ah-ho.
I don't want you taking that thing.
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
We'll go to a hotel.
We'll go to a hotel.
Whoa!!!
What was it?
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
No!!
Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
Woo-hoo!!
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
All right! Let's do it!
Yeah, cheerie-o!
London baby!
Wow!!
Thanks.
Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.
Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
Oh dear God, let me think.
Y-sure!
W-What was the one right before bananas?
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
Okay.
YES!!
Okay.
No-no-no-no!
Uh fellas,
Okay, so he's out of here.
Yaaaay!
What?
I think you should drink the fat.
Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
Yeah!!!
Yeah! All right? Let's go!
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
All right!!
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Yeah...
WHAT?!!
Are you all right?!
What happened?!!
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
You?
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
Yeah!
Wow!
Hey, Pheebs!
Hey!
Hey!
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
Yeah, I know.
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
How sad are we?
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Yeah!
I'm in it.
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Yeah.
This is terrible, what are you going to do?
I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
Oh, God!
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Uh, Joey..
Okay..
Oh! That was Lambchop!
Hey! Oh.
You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
Hey.
Hi, Joe.
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
Oh, Chandler.
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
Hi Chandler!
That's... That's was...
The what?
Who?
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
The abridgment.
Oh, okay. The what?
Come here.
Chandler, what did she say?
Wait a minute.
Are you sure?
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's...
What? What?
Hey guys!
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
You think?
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
Hi, honey.
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
Oh yeah!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
One more game?
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
I'm sorry!
Hey Ross!
What?
They did it right there on the couch.
Hey!
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Okay, great!
Yeah.
Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
All right.
Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
I'm a man.
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Defend yourself.
Hmm.
Hey Pheebs!
PBS Telethon.
Hi Joey.
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Yeah, so.
What?
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Yeah right.
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
It's Joey.
Hey!
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
No. What?
Yes!
Okay.
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
Barmifsaed?
Hey guys!
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
Joey! Come here! Come here!
What? What?
Oh! Yeah!
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
Oh, no!
Umm?
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Yeah right!
Hey.
Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Thank you.
Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
Coffee.
Cappuccino.
Grazie.
Come on!
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Yeah, you do!
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Good one.
I Gotcha!!
We'll see.
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
I ran!!
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
Actually, me too.
I went.
Thanks Ross.
Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
Great, how did it go?
I didn't get it.
Not me.
I did.
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Y'know what?
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
We're just gonna be friends.
Umm?
I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
I know. Yeah.
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
Yeah me too.
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
No, we're alright.
Hey Chandler!
Huh.
Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
Hey!
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Hey guys.
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
Hey, Pheebs?
Oh my God!
I had a problem.
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
No one.
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Who's they?
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
You got it.
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
Okay, see ya later.
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
No. No.
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Do you two know each other?
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Yeah, sure.
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
No, not you.
Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
Oh. What?
What's wrong?
I just remembered, I have to do something.
Um, leave.
Wait, wait, wait!
It's not.
Done!
And it can't be Joey.
Or Joseph.
Oh.
Oh, OK.
Ewww!
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Okay, great.
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.
Okay.
Hey Rach!
Hey!
Hey!
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
That's nice.
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
I got time.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
I got the time to get to know Julie.
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
Hey! Hey!!
Well, they go into the chipper.
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
Oh yeah?
Two days ago.
Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
Hey.
Hi! How'd it go?
Do what?
What?
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
Put all my money in me.
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
Hey, hey.
No, I just talked to them.
I'm calling Mom.
Hey.
Hey.
Get out.
How come you have two?
Well this one's for you.
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Hey, you guys!
Hi Gunther.
Yeah, we'll see!
Hey!
Guess what?
It is.
Oh, it is.
It isn't.
Isn't!
Breathe.
Yeah, you do!
Have you even had a girl up here?
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Come on!
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
You got it!
Hey!
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
All right!
All right, bye-bye now!
What happened?
So what happened?
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
You kissed him?!
Hey Pheebs?
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Oh hi!
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Hey Rach.
Yes, I am!
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Joey.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
That's us.
Damnit Carl!
Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
That's right, $2,000.
No. Really?
Fine.
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
My chair heels itself.
What's this?
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
It's a beautiful thing.
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
Which goes where?
Thank you!
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Like what?
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
Hey Monica!
Pretty much.
All right.
Hi!
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Hey now!
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
Ahh!
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
What's up?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
You do?
I'm so sorry.
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Sorry Phoebe.
What am I gonna do?
No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
Me too.
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Me neither.
Guys, we bought the tickets.
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
I'll get it.
Oh man!!
I know!
Oh.
Hey.
What else?
Just pull on it.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
Here you go.
Thank you.
What party?
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Oh no.
A birthday party.
Who's birthday party?
Yeah, big!
No-no.
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
I think so.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Well, that went well.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
You don't know!
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Okay, fine.
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
YOU KNOW!!!!
Oh! Oh!
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
About Ross!
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Oh. Oh.
Where are you gettin' this?
Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
Joey...
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
So what.
That's a two line part.
Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
Hey Phoebe!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Or an uncle...
Hi Pheebs!
Pheebs!
Like this.
I know what it did! Nothing.
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Sure! It flushes it.
Hey, Kate!
Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!
The little ones do.
Morning.
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
Okay, done.
You slept with another woman?
Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
What's 'pleh'?
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Thanks man.
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Yes.
Okay man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
They do!
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Chocolate-chip pancakes!
Oh no-no-no-no!
Why would he turn off the TV?
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
We don't know what could make this go away.
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah, I added three.
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Thank God!
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Oh, just until the glue dries.
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Ah.
Yeah, me too.
Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
Fine.
That's crazy.
Well, how-how come?
That's just the way it is.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
Oh, I will.
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Make a wish?
Yeah, all right.
I wanted to go to the strip club!
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Hey!
Hey!
What is it?
Wha-
Wha-
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Hey!
Yeah, for you!
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Really?
Hey! There you are!
There I am!
Hey you guys.
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Hey Joe what's up?
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
I'm 30!
Seriously?
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
Aww crap!
I'm listening.
Huh?
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
See?
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
Okay, fine.
I can't tell you what I know.
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
You don't know!
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
Yeah! Look!
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
Really?
I've never lived like this before.
I know.
Yeah, whatever.
All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
It's your turn.
Oh, are we playing this?!
Which what?
Yep.
Which?
You've never met Bob, have you?
No, but he's...
Thanks Ross.
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
I went.
Oh, I know...
Yeah!
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
Hey Mon!
Thanks for the help, problem solved.
Hello.
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
No. Why?
Oh, you didn't see the Post?
No. You?
So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
That's true.
She's not even cold yet!
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
Okay? You ready?
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
Wait up!
Umm...
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
She said that?!
All the time!
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
All the time?
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Still crying?
How you doin'?
That's right.
What's up Joey?
Excuse me, is this your car?
Yeah.
Really? Thanks.
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Lovely, just lovely.
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Excellent, I'll be there.
Hey, yo.
Bye.
Tonight?
What's tonight?
It is our first official date. Our first date.
Oh, Urse...
You don't drink.
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Oh, classy.
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Yep! I sure know how to pick 'em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
What was it?
Was it like a sneeze only better?
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
Whoa!!!
Oh my.
Oh, I am so sorry.
No me, I am so sorry...
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Ring dammit, ring!
Oh no-no-no!
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
We still have porn.
Hey.
Yeah baby!
Oh.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Oh.
Hey, all right!
Oh yeah!
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
Pretty cool, huh?
You're fake laughing too, right?
You're in!
Any contact?
She lent me an egg once.
Aw, right.
Hi, Ross.
What is that?
Not if I get there first.
Ohhh, man!!
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
What in the name of hell?
Oh, it is.
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Oh, that is so not true.
It isn't.
It is.
Why not?
Yeah
You think we're ready for something like that?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Why, are you moving out?
Good. Hey.
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
Joe. How's it going?
Hi.
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
Umm, okay.
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Hey Rach?
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Yeah?
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
Hey Terry!
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Hey-hey-hey Joey!
Good to see you again!
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
You and Rachel.
It's never gonna happen.
What?
What? Why not?
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Hey! Ah!!
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Hello!
Guess who we ran into today?!
Janice?!
Hey! Hiya!
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Hi!
Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
I told ya.
You got married to fast.
That's not advice!
I'm going to the bathroom.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Oh my God!
Who is it?
N.Y.P.D!!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Her what?
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
Hey, I'm back!
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Wafer thin ice!
Hi-hi Joey.
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Oh right, right.
Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
I got fired.
"Big guy?"
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Oh!
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
It's 4:30.
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
Uh, four.
There. Now there is.
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Four.
Five.
You could?
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Your own boat?
You cuddled.
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
Yeah, which was nice.
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
You serious?
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
Oh yes!
Okay, get ready to owe me!
He's fine!
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Is he okay in there?
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
The country.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
H-He's in China!
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
What about the time difference?
Joey Tribbiani.
YOU IDIOT!!!!!
Your name, please?
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study. Uh, sir?
Yes he did.
We did?
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
We all chipped in.
You owe me 20 bucks.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Great! Thanks.
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
For Ross.
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
For Ross, Ross, Ross.
Oh my god.
I love you too.
Cat.
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
Uhh, we still need a tip.
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Oh, yeah!
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Yeah, well...
This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
It's 6:00.
Hi!
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Uhh, Monica?
That makes sense!
And the video camera?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Right! Okay.
Okay! How you doin'?
Very busy.
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
What?! What else did he say?
I didn't get it.
I went.
Great, how did it go?
Good for you.
What?
I was tired!
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Hey Gunther.
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
I know.
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Hey Phoebs.
Cat.
Hey Joey.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
Oh I am!
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
Okay, fine!
Say what?
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Okay, all right.
Yes!
All right, I'm gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.
Okay.
Fan out! Fan out!
That's ridiculous!
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
Can I use.. either thumb?
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
That's weird!
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
That's...kinda hot.
Here you go.
Okay, in we go.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Good for you!
And deaf!
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
Time's up, now your dead.
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Yes.
Hey, Felicity.
Really?
Hello Joey.
Umm, I thought about you all day.
Yeah.
Hey, Paul!
Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Yeah?
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Hey, kids...
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Yeah.
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Hey, stripper!
Yeah?
Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
What?
I think you did.
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
No I didn't.
I think I lost. Three times.
Uh...Cookie?
Yeah you do!
I do.
I do.
Rings?
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
Oh hi!
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Mr. Tribbiani.
Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
Oh my!
Yeah.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
They're male nurses.
Not in my head.
Oh noo...
Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!
Well of course not, but you were very good.
Thanks!
No, I'm good.
Really?
Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she's the same size as me.
So it looks like you've got some great experience here. Let's see ahh, reason for leaving last job?
Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
I'm not sure.
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
What are you talking about?
Hi!
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
C'mon, Ross!
What are you doing?
I have no idea.
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
You got it.
What's ready?
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
Just come.
Oh my God!
What's wrong?
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Yeah. Oh.
I just remembered, I have to do something.
Oh. What?
Yeah, that's her.
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
Thank you.
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
No, look.
Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
That's a pig.
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Thanks, Chandler.
You really think so?
Yeah. I really do.
Get off!
Hi.
Guess what?
Hey, you guys!
Hey!
What?
I got a gig!
Why not?!
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Please don't say naked chicks.
I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Well, I want it!
Why can't I find that?
Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
You can have it!
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
This body?
I-I-I-I did?
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
Yeah! No?
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
A kiss? What are you talking about?
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Hey! Terry.
Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he...
Gay? Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
See ya!
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
What's in it?
Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
Sir?
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
All right, Ross!
So, er... how did it go with Celia?
Oh, I was unbelievable.
I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Ohh yeah.
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Right?
Nope.
I'm gonna do it.
Yeah I guess you're right.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
I don't know what else to say.
Good night.
That was one good minute!
Good night.
Men are such idiots.
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
What message?
Hey!
Please tell me you got the message!
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
What picture?!
Action!
I found the picture!
The picture of my wife! In your pack!
You went through my personal property?
What the?!
'Kay!

She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
What up?!
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
Everyone, this is Julie.
Julie.
Sorry, sorry.
That's fine, I'll just wait!
Oh, sorry.
Monica!
Are we ready to order?
I'll take it!
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
That might work!
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
It's creamier.
Mmmm. Good.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Yeah, well, is that better?
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
It's a woman.
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
So talk to her.
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
You're kidding!
Hey!
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
You're kidding, no!
Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So...
Yeah you did.
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Okay.
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Like-like what?
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
Wow!
Okay. I'm in.
But what does that gonna do...
For Chandler!
Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
Does it have to be a whole day?
Yeah. You okay?
Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
Sorry, Pheebs.
Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
Yeah.
I don't wanna.
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Come on, let me see that smile.
Please?
I wanted to go to the strip club!
Pretty good.
Morning!
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
I think you're right.
Noo! Nothing!
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
All right, ready?
One.
A monkey.
Hi, can I help you?
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
Yes have you seen any?
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Oh. Sorry!
Hey.
Hey.
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
Me too.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Huh? Uh...
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
What are you doing tonight?
Dude! Dude!
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
...I'm his
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Not really.
Um-hmm.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Well there you have it!
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
Pheebs! Sorry!
Are you all right?
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
She's gone.
Dude!
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
What?
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
Big day.
Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Aww...
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
You know he's gay?
Hey I-
But that's what...
I should just be happy to be near you.
Hey what?
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
Hey Jessica.
Okay, I'm totally cool!
Come in.
Hey Jess.
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Don't do it!
Why?
Okay, it's um...
Don't do what?
I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
Oh my God.
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
What?
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
You look good.
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
Joey.
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
You don't say.
Ohh, Nothing.
OH...MY...GAWD!!
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
I know what it did! Nothing.
Hey, you're back!
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
Damn Rollos!
Hey.
How was your conference?
You guys okay?
Twice?
Oh, that sucks!
I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Hey-hey, Ross?
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
Yeah.
I've got a science question.
Good luck.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
You too.
You know the song! Sing along!
Okay, Phoebe...
Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Oh!
Yes! Your honor?
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Okay, bye-bye.
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
God. You seem really, really nice.
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
All right, here we go.
Okay, shoot.
Can I be that guy?
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
I didn't get it?
Yeah I did!
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
You got a callback too didn't you?
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Sure is.
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
Yeah.
OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.
Alright.
What?! Why?!
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
What is going on with you?
Nothing!
Here you go!
Okay.
Break!
Chandler! Chandler!
Hi.
We're the guys.
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
You hear that? We're the guys.
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
Thank you.
Okay, you're on.
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Yeah, I know!!!!
YOU KNOW!!!!
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Wow! Cool!
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
Uh-huh!
Was the chord at least right...
No!
Yeah, I'm ready.
All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
Ready.
You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
No, seriously.
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
No, I got him.
Oh, seriously you want him?
Hello.
The airport?
Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
A film in Guadalajara!
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
The balloon?
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
I can't, I gotta go.
The country?
Hey!
....I have to go to China.
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
The vicar!
Hello, Zelda.
Who are you supposed to be?
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Like a goalie, right?
Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
Hey!
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
You don't say.
You look good.
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
About what?
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
About how good your cards were.
Heh... I was bluffing.
Hit me!
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
14.
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Stop it!
Unless what?
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Unless!
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Like what?
Well actually...
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
Is this yours?
No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine.
Dude, you soooo need this car.
I didn't get it?
Okay, shoot.
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
Okay, what else?
Yeah! Once.
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
It's happened to you?
Well, what'd you do?
I did it anyway.
Yeah, it's mine.
Yeah, it's not mine.
I love your car.
I bet it's fast.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Come on!!
Hey, Joey.
Hey.
Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
I just got off the phone with my sister.
Hi, Rach.
Maybe I could do it.
Hi!
Hi!
Hey.
No I won't.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
You will like it!
You don't even know!
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
Tell us!
Hey!
How'd it go with Pete?!
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
Uh, 10:30.
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
What time is it now?
4:30.
You're kiddin'.
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Noo.
It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
Oohhh.
Get down!
Hell is filled with people like you.
He's back! The peeper's back!
Get down?
...And boogie!
Get out!!
Fine! Get out!
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
Yeah, big stuff.
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
Eeeshk.
OK, let's go.
OK.
Good morning.
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
You got porn!
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
Hello.
Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
I know I would.
No he, he moved out and I moved in.
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
Hey no problem.
No-no, Kathy.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Or Casey.
Could be Casey.
No. No, Kathy.
No ma'am.
Can't hear you!
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
What the hell happened?!
Sounds good.
Yeah? What did ya have?
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard...
It really was!
Hey!
There are?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
Yeah! Richard!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
We dare.
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Do we dare?
Aaahhhh. AAAAHHHHHH.
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
I think Saturday-.
Yeah, I was bummed too.
So they're going on dates? When?
What's with him?
Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
No! Drums!
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
Drums?
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Okay! When?!
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
I've had better.
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Uh-huh!
London baby!
Woo-hoo!!
Yeah, cheerie-o!
Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
London baby!!
Not a problem.
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
Thanks.
And now for the great news.
Um, this?
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
Yes.
Guys, you got your hair cut.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Oh no-no-no, you don't understand...
Listen to me!
I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
No you won't.
We'll go to a hotel.
We'll go to a hotel.
No we won't.
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
It is???
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
No.
Sure. Yep.
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Certainly.
You-you think?
What?
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Did you like learn about her family?
Two brothers, one died!
I couldn't do it.
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Good for you, Joey.
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
No I didn't.
What?
You just did a little dancy thing.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
You are soo enjoying this.
Mornin' Pheebs!
Hey!
Hey, Pheebs!
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
Was his name Angus?
She's comin'.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
It's me.
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
Umm, hi.
I am now.
Okay.
Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey.
Dude, we got to talk.
I don't know Rach.
Can you people not see me?!
So, will you talk to him?
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Oh-ho, yeah!
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
Yep!
Shut up!
Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
You must stop!
That only took me an hour.
What's twisted?
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
Yeah.
Me going out with Richard's son.
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Well, you know Chandler.
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
Maybe you changed?
Yes! Whew!
Heads.
Heads it is.
We have to assign heads to something.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
I don't think so.
Movies?
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
Well, the duck...
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Y'miss it?
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
My folks.
Ready?
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
My scones.
Oh... Yeah, you do.
'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
'My scones.'
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Okay! All right!
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
Okay. Okay.
Ah! Huh?
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Joey-
Hey.
Hey.
Sounds nice.
So you're really doing this, huh?
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
No kiddin', hmm.
Pheebs, run!
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Run, Phoebe, run!
Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
I call it!!
Are you serious?
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Let's ride.
Can I change a hundred?
Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.
13.
Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
Sorry! Sorry.
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Arghhhhhh!!
Told ya.
Are you out of your mind?
Why?
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
I'm coming up!
When is she leaving?
Tonight. What are you doing?
Hey, mind if I use the phone?
Oh, I...
What are you doing?
A test?!!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
Why are you doing this?
Where you going?
Hey.
Hey.
To the bank.
Sperm or regular?
Good for you!
Here you go.
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
It's the Knicks!
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
Screw the Knicks!
Whoa!
You don't drink.
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
Oh, Urse...
Yeah! Come on.
Well, hey I did learn.
Really?
Awww...
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
What?! Noooo...
What happened?
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
We didn't ruin it!
What?! Tonight?!
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
That's what Monica said.
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Ohhh, yeah!
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
This is amazing.
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
You're kidding.
I know.
I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
This is crazy.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
I know! Robin is so gay!
So now what have we agreed?
Just pickle.
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Nooo, later.
Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!!
Hormones!
Well, you're amazing.
Why?
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Ah, Kate?
Better?
Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.
Yeah?
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
Uhh, 11!
Fancy guest.
Two seconds...
11, unbelievable 11 is correct. All right, that's 4 for the guys. Ladies, you're up.
All right!
When's that?
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Tonight.
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Did I get it?
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Yeah.
Hello.
What a phony.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Bye bye Joey.
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Sir.
What a tool!
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Hey!
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Yeah!
Hey, how you doin'?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Oh, please!
You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
I've never done that.
It's got 'em!
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Yeah!
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
Sorry Phoebe.
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
I'm so sorry.
What am I gonna do?
I wanna gooooooo!
I love Jacques Cousteau!
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
Oh my God!!
Ahhh.
Okay, here is the phone bill.
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
I'm not Drake.
'Cause it's a television show.
Drake, what're you getting at?
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Is this true?
I'm not finished.
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
It still doesn't work.
Oh.
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
Thanks a lot.
Great scene yeah?
Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.

Nice move.
We should really learn how to play the real way.
I like our way. Oh! Chess!
Yeah.
Hey!
That's the rule.
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
How'd you get to that?
A swimmer!
Peanut butter!
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
Ahh, yes.

This is Janice.
Come on, quite yankin' me.
I'm not yanking you.
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.

He's coming over! He's coming over!

Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Bye, Pheebs!
Thank you.
All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!
London baby!!
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
I'm...happy...for you?
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
Hey! What's up?
Yep!
Hey!
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Dude, I don't know.
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
She was kidding.
Yeah.
Not a dad.
Nighty-nite.
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
So are you ok?
Okay, what else?
I didn't get it?
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
Oh.
I don't believe this!
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
No! Ahhh!!!
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
They know you know.
No.
Joey!
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
Hey, what's up?
Yes.
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
You and me, next dance?
Sweetheart, sweetheart...
There's gravy?
Hey!
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
What are you doing?
What's the matter?!
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
We're very happy for you.
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
All right, I'll take care of it.
Forget about it.
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
How you doin there squirmy?
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
Ohhhh man
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
Who knows?
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Are you drunk?
Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
I'm wearing two belts.
No!
Yes you are!
Are you sure?
What about the chick?
Chicks don't swim.
I don't know. Should we try it?
Sure.
Ooh, I like that.
Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Or you could end up with everything.
All right, so what do you say?
No!
London baby!!
London baby!
Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
I got a gig!
Guess what?
What?
Yay!!
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
Yeah we are!
Yeah. Yeah.
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
And there you go!
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
Chandler!!
Hey no problem.
I know I would.
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
That's right baby.
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
All right, let me in.
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
What do you mean?
Then you do. Heh, heh.
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Y'know, just be there for her.
Not following you.
What you do mean?
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
I think, sub-consciously...
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
Really? I don't...
All right. All right.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Sing!!
I wanna rock and roll all night!
Oh God, yeah.
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Okay!
Wait a minute.
You do, thanks.
Yeah. Sorry.
What?
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Oh, it's perfect!
Yeah.
So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
How about you?
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
I love that movie.
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
For just you?
Ah.
Uh, could you leave me one?
Yeah.
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
We'll be there.
Maybe. Does that scare ya?
Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
Great. I'll ah, see ya then.
All right, rock on.
I'm comin' out!
Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!
Oh no!
And she's supposed to buy this?!
Joey, bravo!
Your chair?!
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Joey you broke my chair!!
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
So, there was no miracle?!
I did it anyway.
Yeah! Once.
Well, what'd you do?
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
Yes you are!
Are you drunk?
No!
All right.
We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
She's a woman!
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
What can I say? She nailed it.
Okay, is there anything else?
You're a dork.
Chandler!
Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
I can't believe this.
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Yeah, they're mine.
Well, they're not mine!
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Why are they here?
Great! Roomie!
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Hi everyone.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Of course!!
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
You slept with the stripper?
Hi, guys.
Hi! Phoebe.
That's kinda nice.
Two.
Three.
Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
Yeah.
Oh my god.
Cleveland.
How, how did that happen?
What?
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
What's going on?
You're kidding. Oh my God.
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
You got screwed.
You guys.
Oh, God.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Ross? You okay?
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
Hold on.
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Hey-hey listen...
Chandler, is that...
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Whadja think?
Chandler?
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
No. No. No.
Rach, there is a decent place to...
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
No?
No. Rosita does not move.
I call Godfather!
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
How is it you?
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
Yep, that's my audition.
Hey! How you doin'?
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Hi Joey.
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Umm, yum!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
I don't know, clean places?
It's Danny.
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
I can hear you!
Okay.
I do not like that woman!
I am loud!
Aww!
I can hear that!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Rachel's at work.
I can still hear you!
It's me, Joey!
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!
Excuse me?
Do I know you?

Yes! Very good.
Hey Joey! We're ready.
Richard? We're ready for you. Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he's playing Vincent.
I'm doing my scenes with you?
All right, all right.
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
What is that?
For the ride.
You hug me!
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
All right!
Hey, do we do this too much?
Nooo, four.
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Nothing, why?
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Pretty nice?
Jurassic Park could happen.
Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
Wouldn't she?
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
Would she?
Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Oh, yeah, I do.
Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
What are you doing out there?
I am, uh, I am...
I've got Ben.
Oh, but-but I can't do it.
Why not?
Because, because I've got Ben.
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Go Joe!!!
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Helloo! Oh!
Pheebs! There you are!
Chandler, is that...
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Hey-hey listen...
Are you bachelors?
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
Sooo?
Nooo!
Are you strippers?
Are you serious?!
I'm kinda beat.
Actually, me too.
Yeah.
Thank God! I'm exhausted!
Are you strippers?
Are you bachelors?
Nooo!
Nooo!
Then you're not invited.
What? I don't get it.
Funny one! That's good!
Monica, will-will you marry me?
Oh man, this is hilarious.
Chandler!!
That one will.
That tone will not make me go any faster.
Joey!
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
All right! Hey-hey!
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Joey!!
Hi!!
Who's your friend? He's hot!
All right, you got it.
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
All right.
Okay.
Cool, thanks.
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
You okay?
Yeah Im fine.
Dad, dad.
You too, sir.
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
Name one!
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
What happened?!!
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
Where's Kate?
Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
She got a job in L.A.
What?!
Who's Elaine?
You got all that from the back of her head?
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Who's Paul?
It's, uh, it's Paul.
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Who's Rick?
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
'We' would be me and Rick.
Who's Rick?
My husband.
Who's seven?
No, I don't think so.
All right, the seven of us miss you.
Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...
Ahh, the babies miss me?
Maybe you changed?
Well, you know Chandler.
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
I didn't change!
Maybe that's the problem.
With a man?
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
What?
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
Yeah! We are!
That's right!
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
We're the Cobras!
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
But you said one.
Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so...
I meant, me plus one!
Okay. Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
What's up man?
I have no idea what you just said.
Put Joey on the phone.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
How do you mean?
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
No, no, no!
Can we start over?
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
No, yeah, Ive done that.
No, we're alright.
I know. Yeah.
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
So I got ya something.
Plastic spoons. Great.
How ya doin'?
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
Hello! Who's in there?
Who in the hell are you?
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
But it really...
What? No-no it's her birthday!
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Damnit!
Damnit Carl!
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
Well, I'm not gonna talk because...
Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
That's us.
But it's $2,000.
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
Sorry.
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
I guess I'm done.
Count for what?
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Fun's over!
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
It's not that bad.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
So, you're just Bing?
Hey! Are you okay?
Nah. I kept myself busy.
Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
Fabulous.
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Not so much.
Sure.
Paid your phone bill?
Hey.
It's only you.
'Tonight' tonight?
She really said that?
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Half hour.
Oh, I'd say about a month.
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Interesting.
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
I-I-I-I did?
Huh?
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
This body?
Y'okay, Phoebe?
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Good for me!
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
What did they do to you?
And there it is.
Ohhh, wow.
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
Okay. Bye.
Ah, the stalker.
Hello.
It's Erica.
Never mind, it's open.
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
In the box.
That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
Chandler?
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
Oh! That's nice.
Go!
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Wow. Good speech.
Put it on.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
Uhh do it?
Yeah?
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times!
Well, where was I?
But, I love you.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
Yeah, you don't want that.
Not the other one?
No, she kept kicking me away!
No!
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
Five years.
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
You've sentenced him?!
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Since then?!
Sure. So how long you been...
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
...I d'know.
Two pizzas?!
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
Really? You'll do anything?
Yeah, I've got something you can do.
What, what is it?
How's that going?
Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
Yeah?
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
What about Andre?
Aren't you gonna...
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Hey.
It's not a cat!
A thousand bucks.
ON A CAT??!!!!
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
Yeah, I've had it.
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
Well I've had it.
Had it.
Had it.
I had a donut.
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Hi!
Hey!
It's All Relative.
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
Gentlemen, you're pick.
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
Nana?
Hey there you are!
So uh, how you doin'?
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
I might know something.
Do you know something?
Do you know something?
I might know something too.
What's the thing you know?
All right. All right.
What?!
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Really? I don't...
Aaaaagggghhhhh. Mommy
Cut.
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
Cut.
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dead.
Ah whatever!
Ohhhh!
Joey! You didn't even know her!
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Aww crap!
I'm 30!
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
Aww. Ohh!
Hey Mon.
Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Put your hands together.
Fight's over!
Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
Bing! You got those numbers for me?
How?! When?!
You?! And-and you?!
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!
IN LONDON!!!
How?! When?!
It happened in London.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Merry Christmas!
Okay, Santa!
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Oh wow! Look at this place!
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
Noo! Nothing!
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
I think you're right.
How're you doing?
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
Yeah.
I'm okay.
Ooh, that bad, huh?
You're kidding right?
Wh-what?! Why?!
It's a money thing, we don't have any.
No.
What?!
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
I can't watch this.
Oh, not my parrot.
What?
Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?
1200.
That's right, $2,000.
That's us.
But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
But, you're not identical twins.
Damnit Carl!
For the ride.
All right, all right.
What is that?
Yeah, like in a cab...
Save it.
Hey! So I'm back.
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Who are you?
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
Mmmm. Good.
Alright...
OK, try this salmon mousse.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
It's creamier.
Ohh great!!!
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
But, he loves Emily?
That's...kinda hot.
That's weird!
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
Hard to say.
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
Why the voice.
Your cappucino sir.
Thank you.
Well, I don't know!!
Better than Chandler.
What happened?!!
We fell asleep! That is all.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
Hey! It's Porsche!!
Don't call us that!
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
Hey!
Ah, are you okay?
Okay.
G'night.
Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
I don't know.
Yeah, it's not mine.
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Nice car!
I love your car.
Yeah, it's mine.
Night, you guys.
Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
Hate that guy!
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
I don't like this anymore.
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
You did the right thing.
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
You could say that.
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
Do you know something?
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Yeah!
Do you know something?
I might know something.
Ahhh...... Eh?
Oh yeah.
Ahhhh....
Uh-huh.
Hey guys!
Awful! Horrible!
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
She was...
She was not good. Not good.
She was nothing compared to you.
Die Hard!!!!!!
And?
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Foxy lady.
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Woah.
Where you goin'?
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
Great nap.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
It really was.
Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
It-it doesn't?
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
No!
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Pick me!!
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
Wow thanks!
Come on man, really how old?!
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Joe?
Yeah!
Am I in it?
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
No! Do you wanna hear it?
Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
Hello.
How's she doing?
Hey.
Hey.
She?
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
Yeah, I'm an actor.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
We can't do that.
That's OK.
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
What? What can't you do?
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
You okay man?
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Uh, HELLO!!
How good is that?
Thanks.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
See?
No. No, Kathy.
No-no, Kathy.
Could be Casey.
Consider Casey.
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Yeah, I didn't know that.
It was a car backfire!
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
Chandler! He's here!
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
It's Alan.
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
Something like that?
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
Yeah.
No we weren't!
Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
I was not!
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
We did it!!
Look, you wanna use our place?
No, I ahh, had another idea.
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
All right. Good deal.
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Yeah?
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
She's right y'know.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Hey!
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
So I can do it?
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
It might be kinda cool.
Yeah you can do it.
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
In a minute!!
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
So this is it? Victor?
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
How do I look?
Hi. She said yes.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
Ooh, so close.
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Next time?
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
Damnit Phoebe!!
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
I am gonna see her again.
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Every night!!
Why, how much is that?
That's about 60 cents.
You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Hello, Zelda.
Oh yeah, totally!
Oh good.
Who are you supposed to be?
The vicar!
Merry Christmas!!
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
Oh! Oh my God!
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
PBS Telethon.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Hi Joey.
Hey Pheebs!
PBS telethon.
Why?
What's your point?
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Sort of...
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Guys, what's going on?
Phoebe's a porn star!
Wh-what?! Why?!
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
It's a money thing, we don't have any.
You're kidding right?
Ooh, I look good.
Page 42, page 42, page 42.
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
No, but he's...
Which what?
You've never met Bob, have you?
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Hey, Joey.
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Hey!
Hey!
Yeah!
That was good beer.
What's up buddy?
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Joey!
What are you doing?
Waiting for candy.
She told us.
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
How do you know exactly what she's going through?
So whaddya got there Monica?
Just some stuff for the party.
What are you gonna do?
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
Okay.
Well what is it?!
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
No-no, thank you.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
Thank you, Joey.
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.
I took a shot.
Althea!
Althea?! What are you doing?!
You're shooting with Althea?!
Althea is correct.
Oh dear God!
What?!?!
What?
Hey!
Hey!
But that's what...
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
I should just be happy to be near you.
Hey I-
But then you left.
How is this your seat?
'Cause I was sitting there.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
Thank you so much.
'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.
Unbelievable.
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
But I'm the host!
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
No you answer it and take pledges.
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
You do, thanks.
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Yeah, no, I understand.
Yeah. Sorry.
Wait a minute.
I'm having surgery!
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
What?!
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
Wow, it's big!
All right!!
Oh, good job Joe.
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
What do you need?
Why should I help you?!
The reason he just said.
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
Yeah?
Maybe that's the problem.
Maybe you changed?
I didn't change!
What?!
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Yeah, what's that about?
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
You're good. These are not.
What? What's wrong?
What?
Nothing. Nothing.
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
How'd it go?
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
Hey!
Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
Oh good!
What do you got there?
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
Condoms, dude!
How come the writing is in Spanish?
Oh, well I'm uh...
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
We'll just see.
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
I'm marrying her.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!
Oh yeah, that's right!
What?
He's a dropper!
I'm not a dropper!
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
Don't answer that.
What?
Was she good?
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
She was...
Dark red.
What are you guys doing up?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Yes, you are so smart!
Kristen Lang.
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Bye!
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Morning, Paul.
Morning. Good morning.
Morning.
Hello, Paul.
Hi, Paul, is it?
Peanut butter!
Yes!
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
A swimmer!
Problem solved.
How'd you get over that teacher?
I didn't. I got under him.
Bye Phoebe.
Okay bye.
Stop callin'!!
Hello.
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
All right!
True story!
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
Uh, oh-ho bye.
Here we go people! Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la... Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is... Thank you, boys and girls, you've ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother's crab cakes! Excuse me!!
Anyone mind if I save this?
This is your place?
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
Is everything okay?
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
What? What? What? What is it?
What's going on?
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
It's him, not it!
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
What, what is it?
Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, I've got something you can do.
Can you be my dancing partner?
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
Take it back?
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Absolutely.
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Oh-ho, and mine!
Oh so-so not really never.
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Sure! What's up?
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Welcome to America.
I'll go.
Yay!
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Yay! Emily!
Well don't just say.
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
Huh, I'm just saying...
Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
Ok.
She's right in there.
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Where's Mary-Angela?
Hey, Chandler!
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Didn't think so.
All right! But, you do it with me once.
Joey!
Hey, Phoebe!
Hi, Pheebs!
What did they do?
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Hi-hi, I'm Joey.
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
I'm Dutch.
I'm Margha.
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
Okay! How you doin'?
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
Very busy.
Right! Okay.
What's goin' on?
Joey!!!
No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
You're it! Now run and hide!
It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
What about the chick?
What 'cha doing?
Having a swim.
Chicks don't swim.
Are you sure?
No he doesn't!
Wh-what's going on?
Oh.
Two hours, that lasted!
So did you break up with Joanna?
It's cute, huh?
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Okay. It's a chicken.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
You're one to talk.
...I d'know.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Where are you going?
What's the big deal?
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
How about you guys?
Open bar?
I don't need that anymore.
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
What about my cab?
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
Because it's faster.
Why don't we just go on two.
Why two?
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Oh!
Is something wrong?
Dude! How come you took off?
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Okay.
I slept with Monica.
Yeah, what's going on?
What's going on?
Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Oh no!
Hey. It happened!
It-it did!
Sure!
Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
I can't take any...
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Right-right up here.
Y'know, there's two women dude.
Show me where?
Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
I don't know! Yeah, I do.
Hey, you know about that?!
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Yeah, that was real.
See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
I know.
We have a winner!
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
Step back.
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
How come those?
How did you make $17.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
What happened to uh, MEG.?
You're not gonna like it.
You want my advice?
Yes! Please!
That's okay.
You got married to fast.
They loved me!
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
Oh my God!
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
Are you actually saying these words?
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Hey, you're back too!
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Hi!
Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Oh... Yeah, you do.
I don't sound like that.
Oh, oh Chandler...
'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
My scones.
Okay. Okay. Ace!
Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't.
What make you think I can?!
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Because we won our apartment back!
What 'cha doing?
See ya.
What did you do?
Having a swim.
What about the chick?
Fine! Get out!
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Get out!!
How do you figure?
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
I think I should get the chair!
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
No more jam?!
Put your hands together.
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Where've you been?
Hi.
Hey.
At the vet.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
I want to do it again.
Uh-huh!
I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
We can't do it again.
Why not?
Hey! You wanna go?
I'm sorry?
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
Yeah, let's go.
Okay. See you guys later.
Not in my head.
Oh my!
They're male nurses.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
I need something sweet.
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Yeah, sure.
Uhh, rub it?
Uh, boat rope.
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
Good for you!!
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
That's what you told me.
So I got your car, it's right outside.
Why? Are we done for the day?
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
'My scones.'
'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
My scones.
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
...I d'know.
Since then?!
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
You're one to talk.
3, 2,
No.
Me neither.
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Alrightalrightalright. There.
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
I can't believe we live here!
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
People can hear you.
Cage closed?
Is it back in the cage?
Its back in cage!
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Ohh. Mmm.
Dry cleaners?
What-But you saw the show!
Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
Everyday use.
Oh!
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Fancy.
Guest.
Glove salesman!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
Good one! Yeah.
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Guggly worm.
Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
So now, what is this now?
And this?
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
Hair transplant.
Transplant.
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
But you're not bald.
It's not on my head.
Hola, amigos!
Ewww!
Hola, Joey!
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
Holden McGroin.
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
Name?
Tell him.
No.
Howdy partner!
Yeah!
That really is something; that's really cool.
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Iced tea.
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Okay, anything for you sir?
Did I not just tell him?
Instead of...?
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
That's right.
Never had that dream.
Monkey lover!
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
When do you think we lost her?
Probably around gonorrhea.
North route!
Ascot!
North route or south route?
Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
OH YES!!!!!
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Strip Happy Days Game?
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
Such as?
Ok, Phoebe.
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
YEAH!!! YES!!!
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Oh my God.
I call Monica's room!
You can't just call Monica's room.
YOU KNOW!!!!
You don't know!
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Yeah, I know!!!!
Yeah, what's that like?
Are you thinking about Monica?
Yeah.
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
What's the rush? What?
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
Well... It's a date.
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
I don't know! Charity?
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Ugh!
Well, just buy the damn boat!
I like her so much!
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
I can see why that's hard to resist.
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
Come, come here.
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
We can't do this.
No! Oyster?
Where have you been?
Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
Well hello!
The doctor.
Is everything okay?
I think I know that girl.
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Yeah, it's for our catering business!
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
No?
Oh, not my parrot.
Huh?
All right then.
What?
I can't watch this.
So you're the gynaecologist?
What is it, Tim?
It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
Hey, I'm trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!!
Oh, okay. The what?
The what?
The abridgment.
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
I was afraid of that.
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
Know what I mean?
Yeah I'll take that.
Hey.
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
What's up?
Monica and I are engaged.
No, I don't think so.
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
So you're not homesick yet?
All right, the seven of us miss you.
Who's seven?
Yeah, all right. Ooh!
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
Joey!
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
Sure! Why not?
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
M-Me again?
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Really? To what?
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
Oh, you should here me.
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
I'm not answering that.
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
No way.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
I guessed 20,000!
I won! That was my guess!
What?! What?! What?!
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
What?! I don't have 20,000!
I-I wasn't in that.
So, so, what'd ya think?
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
I know.
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
Hey, you're not Kip!
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Do you even know who Kip is?
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
They're here already?
I thought that was just a rumour.
True story.
All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
It was.
Really? I can do it?
What?
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
I'd love it if you would do it.
Hey!
Okay that's fair.
Oh.
Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
All right.
Good!
Oh, hey let me.
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Of course I did.
Open the box!!
They were threefold.
Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm... Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
What?!
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
You knew about that?
How'd you get to that?
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
No plans, huh?
Multiple orgasms!
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
Not a one.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Oh umm, not go.
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
I said name one!
That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Yeah, I got my speech!
This is it! This is my category.
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Do you got your gracious loser face?
Yeah.
Nothing. No, nothing.
I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.
What?
I was going to call him, but...
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
Yeah, so did I.
Why not?
I live upstate.
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Oh, what did I say?
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Hmm, noodle soup.
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
You want my advice?
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
Yes! Please!
You're not gonna like it.
You seen Sandy?
There y'go, kids.
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
You got it! Oh-oh!
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
What are you doing?!
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Oh no, what happened?
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Hiii.
Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
Oh no.
I think I'm gonna cry!
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Okay, take it easy.
Sure!
Well, I'll see you later.
Hey! That's my car.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
They're so small!
You did it, man.
Would you like to see them?
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Great!
Hey dude, it's me.
Looks good.
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
Hey it's Joey!
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
Ooh! So close.
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Hey everybody!
Hi!
Wh-what's going on?
Hello, Chandler.
I love you.
Oh.
No he doesn't!
Don't come out here!
Yeah!
Hey!
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
So uh, how you doin'?
She's not crazy is she?
No.
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
Hey there you are!
Can we see her?
How's the hair?
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
Yeah.
Well, let me see.
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing.
Consider it done.
Hat, milk, got it.
??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
You understood that?
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
A little foos?
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Welcome home man.
Absolutely.
What happened to the foosball?
A little salami.
Monica said that did she?
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
Pastrami.
It's never gonna happen.
I do.
Oh Ross, you're so great.
What?
You and Rachel.
Let me see that!
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
All right.
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
Good luck, man.
Do you want any help?
You come out there, you're a dead man.
Thanks. OK.
OK.
You really think so?
No.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Yeah. I really do.
Thanks, Chandler.
That's what it says.
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
Funniest? Heckles?
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
I'd call that excessive.
You couldn't do it?!
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
I couldn't do it.
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
What?! You're going out with her again!
Uh, moist, yeah.
...love you.
Are you're hands still wet?
Let's dry 'em again.
Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler.
Give me $400!
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
Okay...
Professor Geller?
Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know.
Nope, not that one.
I felt it!
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Can you go any faster with that?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Hey! What's going on?
Well, apparently she does.
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
What a bad idea!
Will you marry me?
Oh-no. No. No.
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
Chandler, why are you doing this?
Whoa, I'm not done.
Oh yeah.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Bye-bye.
I can't believe this Chandler!
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Really?! Well, when?
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
Wow.
Both of us?
Well ah, ........y'know.
Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Maybe. Does that scare ya?
Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
I know! It's stuck!!!
Look.
Oh my God!
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
I put it on to scare Chandler!
Yeah, Big Brother.
What are you up too?
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
You can pee here!
Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?
Why?
Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
Not the other one?
But you got to be with both of them, right?
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
No, she kept kicking me away!
Yeah, you don't want that.
Oh no, not you too!
Hey!
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
Nice!
Hey, look who's up.
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
In my day, divorce was not an option.
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
I just had a glass.
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Really? I only had two glasses.
Two.
I had one glass.
All right, I'm gonna go!
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
What?!
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
See you in 2003.
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
I'm 16.
You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Not following you.
What do you mean?
Y'know, just be there for her.
Think about it.
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
I am... free!
Nothing.
Nothing.
Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
What?!
Marcel, I'm hungry.
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Just, just say what you feel.
That was good.
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Oh, I embarrass you?
Well, I like it. Here you go.
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
Where's my underwear?!
The sheep.
Hey, what you do on your own time...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
He took my essence!
Just pull on it.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Ohh we're not sailing.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
What else?
No, only for sex.
To be nice.
Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Well, we could do that!
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
There's other stuff too.
We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
Is that your card?
All right now, memorize it. You got it?
Oh yes.
Yes.
Hey guys!
My mom will.
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
She really said that?
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
'Tonight' tonight?
You don't think I know that!
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
We didn't give you any money!
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
She is so hot!
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Score.
Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
Pheebs?
Great! Thanks, Rach!
Done.
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Sure! God, please take those off!
All right.
Well we'll see!
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
I don't think you have much choice.
Bye-bye!
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
I finished my book.
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
It's coming from the living room.
Hey, you guys.
Hey.
Oh. What do you do?
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Nooo.
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
Yeah, I actually don't know...
Is there a problem?
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
Stevie the TV?
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
That sounds fair.
Yeah well we should order some food then.
No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
That sounds perfect!
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
Ohh...
Yeah.
You're gonna mess it up let me do it.
You kissed him?!
What happened?
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
You pushed him!
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
Joey, I saw you push him!
Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
You can't do anything!
That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
That's what I did. Wah-pah!
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Hey!
Well, how-how come?
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
That's just the way it is.
That's crazy.
Yeah, they're not coming.
Hey.
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
What?!
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Oh no! No! No!
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Monica!
She's sleeping.
Hey, what time is it?
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Also an island.
2:17.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Oh, just had a baby.
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Where have you been?
Mazel tov!
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
Well, where was I?
Uhh do it?
That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times!
Hi!
Hey!
Oh yeah, no problem.
Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
Thanks.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
What's the matter Ross?
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Why?
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Uh-huh!
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
What's the thing you know?
I might know something.
I might know something too.
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
I can't tell you what I know.
Aww, there we go.
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Thanks.
I love Vegas!
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Oh. Then, no.
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Of course.
Did I put too much rum in here?
Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
How'd you get to that?
That's the rule.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
You knew about that?
No, but I'm gonna!
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Can I ask you something?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
'Kay!
Uhh, no.
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Pheebs! There you are!
Go Joe!!!
Helloo! Oh!
No it's not, sorry.
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
I don't know! Yeah, I do.
Right-right up here.
Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
Joey!
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
It's not on my head.
Hair transplant.
But you're not bald.
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
Okay, pick a card.
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Man! They cannot get enough!
Okay.
All right now, memorize it. You got it?
Yeah, that makes sense.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Over my dead body!
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
I'm sorry. See ya.
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
Isn't it.
You can't go out there.
Hey, where are you going?
Outside.
Why not?
Because of... the reason.
Hey, listen you ah....
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
I'm probably gonna need those. Huh?
Hmm?
...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
That was good beer.
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Yeah!
Ohh...
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Wow! This looks great!
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
Oh, just until the glue dries.
Thank God!
H-h-h-how's the duck?
Somebody lose a ring?
Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
Yeah I guess you're right.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
I'm gonna do it.
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
I'll get it.
Hello.
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
But I made cards!!
I feel...
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
G'night.
She's still asleep.
Shhhh!
...spender.
So how'd it go?
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
....yeah... what else?
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
OK. I'm in my apartment...
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Oh-whoa, what party?
Then you're not invited.
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
Well umm...
The baby shower for Phoebe!
What-what's so funny?
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
Oh.
Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Uhh, they're tall.
Good! Good! Five points!
All right, Joey, same question.
Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
That's not even a game!
Waiting for candy.
What's up buddy?
What are you doing?
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
See ya tomorrow!
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
Tomorrow!
Can't wait!
Thank you. Hey Pheebs!
Here you go.
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
Hey!
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
I'm not listening to you!
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Someone like an...angel?
Miracle!
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Well, what did you have?
Then keep running.
You win.
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Uh, wow, 700.
I can't tell you what I know.
What's the thing you know?
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Okay, fine.
Or an uncle...
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Hey Phoebe!
Hi Pheebs!
Oh, yeah, good idea.
Hm-mmm.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Hey man, what's up?
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
Hello?
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Mark's a genius!
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
Uhh, Chandler's not here.
Hello?
Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Well, you can help me!
Okay.
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Oh umm, not go.
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
Yeah, I understand.
Hi!
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
That makes sense!
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
And the video camera?
Uhh, Monica?
We love you, man.
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
Happy birthday, pal!
Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
So?
Now that's a thinker.
What-what-what is so funny?
I said, "Like what?"
Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
Hi!
How was your conference?
Hey, you're back!
Hey.
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Ooh, something hurts!
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Hey! You okay?
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Chandler? A word.
Yeah!
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Hey! How's it going?
That's all right, that's well, I figured....
Hey!
Good.
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Hey, here she comes.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Hey.
Hey.
Yes! Yes, I did.
Oh my God!
Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
Then do Iceberg!
G-sharp.
You call that delicious?
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Okay, the last thing...
They have another guess.
Okay, well, we won that one.
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
Nah, not my game.
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Well, what's it called?
That'll be $3.85.
Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
Women are mean!!!
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Hey.
Thank you. Thank you.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Still rolling, annnnd action!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
You got me. I don't...
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Why would they think they're invited?
Joey!
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
Oh, you bet I am!
Gotcha.
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Okay, here's your penis!
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
What's wrong buddy?
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Hi.
Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Well, what did the police say?
Hey, where are you going?
Thanks. OK.
OK.
Outside.
You can't go out there.
Let's get out of here.
Never mind, it's open.
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
The one time they're not home.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
You sick bastards!
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
She's just doing her job!
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Ohh! So you're 5639?!
Hey!
Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
Uh yeah, right here.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Thank you, Happy Holidays.
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Oh hey, here Pheebs.
Phoebe, are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Just being friendly.
You got it.
Joey, what are you doing?
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
No problem. Hey Chandler
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
I think they get it.
Ok.
Can I see the comics?
Is that your new walk?
No, I really have to pee.
This is the New York Times.
Okay, may I see the comics?
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Monica, you asked the question.
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
What's going on?
Nice shoes, huh?
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Aah, y'killing me!
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
What's the rush? What?
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
God Joey, this is taking forever!
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Hey, hey, hey no.
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.
He's talking to London!
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Joey!!
All right! Hey-hey!
The bigger half.
Make a wish?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
That's so sweet.
Are you really not going?
Would it matter?
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
Got it! So...
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
Kristen.
So uh, do you live around here?
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
All right, here we go.
Okay, bye-bye.
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Okay.
Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Hi sweetie!
Hey, how are you holding up?
Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Here, I brought you some flowers.
Are you ok, Ross?
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
That is so funny. Let me see that.
I don't know. What's in this pie?
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
Uh, boat rope.
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Uhh, rub it?
Thanks for telling me!
Hey-hey, what's going on?
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
I can still hear you!
I can hear that!
Rachel's at work.
Hey!
Hey!
Woah, hey, yo.
Hey you.
Hey you.
So, uh, how was your day?
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
But it's dark out.
Monica? What time is it?
Uhh, 9.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
Really? A purse?
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
It looks like a women's purse.
Picture? What picture?
All right.
I found the picture!
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Well, what's it called?
Nah, not my game.
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Cups.
I don't know how to play Cups.
Oh-oh, what about Ross?
Great!
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
Hey!
What is the big deal?
So?
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
What did you just do?
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Who's birthday party?
What party?
A birthday party.
Allison's birthday party.
Oh, and how is Allison?
Pretty much, yeah.
How ya doin'?
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Well, when it's not right, you know it.
I know! They suck!!
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
My-Oh my God!
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
I know!
All right. Good deal.
All right, fine.
Joey, I'm in!
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Yeah!
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Uhh, the ball thing.
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Yeah?
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
You want his yearbook?
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
I'll take that.
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
Hey man, what's up?
Hey!
Oh, this guy again.
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Sure, what do you want to see?
All right. I can't see.
Okay.
'Kay, put your head back.
All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
Why are you doing this?
What are you doing?
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
We just got the message.
Yeah. Oooh...
He looks so tiny.
Is he alright?
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
Ross has a boyfriend.
Whoa!
Whoa what?
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Really?
Man you are incredible.
Kick save and... denied.
But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
Well, we had a table in college.
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
Chandler's wearing panties.
Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing.
Joey, some people don't like that.
What? Let me see.
No, no, you don't have to see.
Oh, how bad is it?
Excuse me?
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
How's your room Rach?
I gotta get one, too.
I guess so.
You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
What are you guys doing?
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Yeah, yeah he is.
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Is this guy great or what?
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
Are you going to do it?
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
OK, here goes.
I'm going to do it.
Do you want any help?
And you'll be nice?
You won't boss me around anymore?
I won't boss you around.
And, I'll be nice.
And you'll be topless?
I know, Monica told me.
What?!
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Yeah. Sure.
So, you're just Bing?
It's not that bad.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
I have no name.
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
What's up with Gene?
Bye, Gene.
It's Clint! Clint!
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Joey, this is you!
Let me see. Oh, right.
What?! I don't have 20,000!
I guessed 20,000!
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
Joey! Sit down!
Call it even?
Really?!
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Okay.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Hey Estelle, listen...
That you're not funny or sexy?
That's right!
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Ooh, very official.
Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final.
Well, it's about time.
Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
And who laminated it?
Wait, wait, wait!
Oh. What?
Um, leave.
So I guess you all saw it.
Saw what?
Glass of fat?
Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
No! Do you wanna hear it?
How come you have two?
Hey.
Hey.
Well this one's for you.
Get out.
It does in mine!
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
It doesn't say that in the script.
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
You bug me.
Yeah, I was bummed too.
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Really? Male nurses?
So they're going on dates? When?
I think Saturday-.
So what are you gonna do?
It's for me.
Oh. Okay, bye.
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
You-you do?
You got me.
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
I am so sorry man.
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
I can't believe I ruined this.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Oh my God.
You got a better idea?
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
All right, call it in the air.
Heads.
Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
You're smart. I like that.
Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
Hiya.
So, I guess this is it.
Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
Thanks.
Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
You're getting a cat?
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
Alright.
Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.
Together?
Yeah, but it's my wax.
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
But it's my car!
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
It's not my first time.
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
Yeah. Bijan for men?
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Your territory, huh?
No thanks.
Hombre?
Wow! This looks great!
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
You wanna smell him?
And who is this little cutie pie?
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
I assume we're talking about the baby now.
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
Of course I did.
Oh, hey let me.
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
"When can you move in?"
What?! Are you kidding?!
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
You're not his godfather.
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
All right!
Well that's how I feel.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Well then maybe you should take it.
Well then maybe I will.
Sorry, that was wax.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Oh, you weren't finished?
Oh, that's great!!
Joey!
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Why can't I find that?
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
Yeah, yeah.
Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Well, I want it!
Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
No, it's just my luggage.
Hey!!
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
I'm still on the set!
Damnit!
What? Why? Where are you?
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
Wow! Didn't know that.
You know you've been spitting on me?!
That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
Great!
Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
They actually said that?
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
That's Fergie baby!!
That's... That's was...
Oh my God!
Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
So, I hear you're single now...
Feel better now?
Yeah, totally!
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
What you do mean?
I think, sub-consciously...
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
Great scene yeah?
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Cut! Wonderful!
Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
Thanks a lot.
I had the same dream!
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Yeah, it's in there.
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Ohh, I love birds.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
What is the matter with you ?!?
What?
You look like a freak.
Oh come on!!
Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Awful, absolutely awful.
What are you, what are you doing?
Uh, wow, 700.
Well, what did you have?
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Not 700 exactly?
Yeah.
Like a goalie, right?
The vicar!
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
You got a little bored?
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
Oh I a lot of stuff!
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Yeah? What did ya have?
Excellent, I'll be there.
Really? Thanks.
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Oh, and how is Allison?
Who's birthday party?
Allison's birthday party.
32.
Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
That's a really long time.
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Eight months.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
What?
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
That's not a state Joe.
I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
Okay.
What kind of smell?
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
I don't know. Soap?
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
My god, Angela.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Hi, Joey.
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Are you gonna go over there?
Have you seen Monica?
Hey.
Hey.
I'm not seeing Monica.
What?
Okay, good to see you again.
Or I'll call you!
And call me!
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
And you'll be topless?
And you'll be nice?
And, I'll be nice.
And-Joey!
Do you want me to learn?!
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
Oh hey! How was your audition?
What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
You kissed my girlfriend!
He's doin' some thinkin'!
What happened? What happened?!
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
Then you're not invited.
Are you strippers?
Nooo!
All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
Oh-whoa, what party?
Can you believe this place?
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
I know, this is a great apartment.
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Wow! Sure! That's great!
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Well, this has been great!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Happy Thanksgiving!
See ya!
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
Chandler loves marriage!!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
That's right.
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
You got that from what I said?!
Where's all the tissues?!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
I know.
Check out the ring.
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
I don't feel like talkin.
Joey.
Open up. We want to talk to you.
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
We're worried about you.
What is this? Fruit?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Monica's making jam.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Naa, she's lyin'.
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Well, why're you all dressed up?
I think face to face.
All right! Just hurry up!
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
I would say that.
Face to face, yeah!
And what did he say?
So, so how did it happen?
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
Wow.
Ohh, I know one thing!
I don't know.
You don't know anything.
What?
They did it right there on the couch.
Well I didn't tell them!
Yeah?
Phoebe knows about us!
Them?! Who's them?
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
When is she leaving?
Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
Tonight. What are you doing?
I'm coming up!
Hey! I made that for her!
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
You made pottery?
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Rach, these are for you.
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Eh! There you go.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Oh, ew!
Hey, thank you so much.
Bye guys.
Yeah, see ya.
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Yep, that's my audition.
How is it you?
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
That's...kinda hot.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Ooh, that bad, huh?
How're you doing?
I'm okay.
What?
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
Right this is staging.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
What happened? What happened?
Well, I guess that's it.
Why, what happened?
My marriage is over.
What?!
We've got a box.
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
I was probably waiting for it to open.
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Oh umm, uh we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
Ben! Ben! Ben!
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Where's your baby?
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Good luck Phoebs.
OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.
Alright.
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
Wow. Good speech.
Oh! That's nice.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Yeah, it really was!
Aw, thanks!
What's the matter, Pheebs?
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
All right.
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
What?!
Then you go to Tokyo.
You play hard to get.
She already lives in London.
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
It is not over! You're over!
Services? Oh, services.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye.
Hey, hey. How was the first day?
What happened to the foosball?
A little foos?
Absolutely.
Ah that's a cantelope.
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Take it back?
Absolutely.
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Well I didn't tell them!
Them?! Who's them?
Joey!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Everybody's doing stuff!
I know. Ross is getting married.
Phoebe is, making people.
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
We could climb Mt. Everest!
Phew, close one.
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats.
Hi.
Hi, sweetie!
Two days ago.
Yeah!
When'd you meet her?
Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
Oh yeah?
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Yeah. Um... I'm out.
I'm in.
What is with your nose?
Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this.
Oh my God.
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
I can give it a shot.
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Stick to your side!
The Ice Capades?
Where you goin'?
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
Hey! You ready to go?
Damn!
Hey!
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
What?
With Carol? Oh.
What?
It was my first time.
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
We didn't ruin it!
What?! Noooo...
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
Are you naked in there?
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
Yeah? That's so nice!
Hard to tell, I was naked.
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Night.
Weekend at Bernie's.
Dangerous Liaisons.
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Oh!
So what's it gonna be?
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Yeah, I got too excited!
Just stop it! Come on!
You okay there man?
All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
You?! And-and you?!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Yes. Yes.
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
How?! When?!
I don't know how to lead.
All right, then show me some manly moves.
All right.
Hello.
Hi.
Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Hey!
Is that a real thing?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Hi, how ya doing?
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
Hey Pete.
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
They're gonna do it together.
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
I would love to do it together!
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
The ring is gone!
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
What?
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
Looks good, uh?
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
I'm reading your ad.
Yeah.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
Well, it involved Monica.
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
Okay. Have a benefit.
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Hey!
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Yeah, he likes porn.
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Yes!
Where ya going?
I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
Hey! I got great news!
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
No, I really have to pee.
Let's go.
Is that your new walk?
Can I see the comics?
This is the New York Times.
Hey! Where have you been?
Okay. Sorry.
Ugh! What grandmother?
Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Oh.
Hmm, noodle soup.
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
All right, let's try one.
Okay. Let's do it again.
Okay.
What did you say to him?
Why?! Why not?!
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Could everyone please take their seats?
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
There is no father.
Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
You spit on me man!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
Look, I'm sorry.
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Oooh, what you got there?
Yeah.
Okay. Every time.
Pastrami.
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
Uh, does it hurt?
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Sure.
It did at first, but not anymore.
Chandler?
Which goes where?
What's this?
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
I have no idea.
Done with the bookcase!
There y'go, kids.
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
You seen Sandy?
Well then maybe I will.
Well that's how I feel.
Well then maybe you should take it.
Fine with me.
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
Yeah!
What are we gonna do?
About Ross!
Oh! Oh!
I call Monica's room!
Oh my God.
YEAH!!! YES!!!
You can't just call Monica's room.
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that?
Sure. Joey...
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Anybody want a croan.
Yes. But all the other ones.
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
Yeah that dog left!
Huh! Where is the dog?!
What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
There's no dog in here.
You said number two.
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
I also said number one.
I know.
Dude! He's right there!
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
I'll see you at 8:00.
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Absolutely!
Okay.
Oh, what's at 8:00?
Psss, that is whack!
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
And cut!
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Heh... I was bluffing.
About what?
About how good your cards were.
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
I don't want to marry Chandler!
Why is 10 the highest?
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
Okay, uh...
I've got cold feet.
Let it go, Ross.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Do you all promise?
You have Knicks tickets?
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
What the hell is that?!!
Okay! Check it out!
What-what is it?!
It's a, it's a cat!
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
Oh my God, you're back!
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Why do you want to see my hand?
I don't want to move again!
I don't know.
What?
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
You gave him cookies?
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
And twenty-five it is.
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Wow, it's really long.
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
It's the same story.
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
Hey-hey, what's going on?
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Thanks for telling me!
But it is our apartment!
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
No it's not!
You guys! You guys! You're gonna have a baby! They're gonna have a baby!
Sure, now I'm scared.
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
Yeah, we look great together.
Oh yeah, that looks good.
You guys make a very attractive couple.
Yeah, we really do!
Okay.
Dad, Ronni's here.
That's a good one!
Hey, Joe.
Huh?
Hi.
Are you thinking about Monica?
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, what's that like?
That he doesn't exist.
Yay!
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
Right.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
It's uh, right through there.
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
Atlantic City!
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
Oh my God! You're water broke!
Ohh!
Right. No big deal.
Yeah.
Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Okay.
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
A two and a five.
All right.
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Really?!
Well, that went well. Yeah.
Just keep smiling.
Okay.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
No, it's just my luggage.
Hey!
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Hey!!
Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
How is this your seat?
What?
You're in my seat.
'Cause I was sitting there.
But then you left.
Havin' some trouble?
Well...
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Rachel locked the door.
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
What the heck is that?
Really?! You think that will work?
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Did she call?
No, sorry.
Look, we are not gonna...
What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Dah!!
Probably kill myself!
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
..Excuse me?
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Done with the bookcase!
Which goes where?
I have no idea.
All finished!
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Anybody gonna eat that?
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Hey, hey, they're runnin'
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
What the hell is in there?
Oh, it's not!
Seriously, it's moving!
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
So where you gettin' it?
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
I think on my shoulder.
What? What's on your shoulder?
So, you and Angela, huh?
What?
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
Yep. Pretty much.
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
This man is my God.
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Um-hum.
Hi.
I didn't get a cat.
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
What?!
You're smart. I like that.
So you uh, still wondering?
No, we just went out.
Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
Come on, they're close.
What?
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Did you call the cops?
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
What?
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
What's the matter with you?!
Hey. Morning, dear.
Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
I thought it was Chandler!
What? What?
So are guys doing okay?
Hey!
Hey-hey.
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Yeah baby!
Sperm or regular?
Where you going?
To the bank.
Sperm.
So you're really doing this, huh?
I can't tell you that, no.
Wow.
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Ross, you need some help?
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
And that doesn't scare you?
From you? Yes, please!
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
You're smoking again?!
Chandler!!
Oh my God!
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Ross, you don't have to yell.
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Yeah, what' going on?
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
What are you talking about?
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
Yeah, what-what's going on?
I knew you were not okay with that.
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Monica had lunch with Richard.
Dawson?!
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
Yeah!
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Okay. See you guys later.
Hey! You wanna go?
Yeah, let's go.
Bye guys.
Yeah, see ya.
Fuggetaboutit. How you doin?
Yeah.
Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
No kiddin', hmm.
Sounds nice.
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
What?
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
So are you gonna tell him?
Ciao, bela.
Do they wait for me to do this?
Why would I tell him?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Erin! Still here!
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
Hey Joey!
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
She laughed at you?
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
It's the Miracle Wax.
That was one good minute!
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Totally worth it!
Good night.
Good night.
Hey uh, what's a matter?
Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
All right.
I talked to Janice.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
All right, I'll see you guys.
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
But, I love you.
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
Hey you guys, guess what?
The British are coming?
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
Well, can you dance at all?
Oh no, no, no, no.
What, what is that?
I got it! Here we go.
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
That's great. Thanks Rach.
He can have his job back.
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
Rach, you're in my seat.
Alright, now you say something.
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Wow.
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Come on! You like this woman, right?
Thank God! I'm exhausted!
Are you serious?!
Yeah.
So you guys want coffees?
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
No! I won't leave you!
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
No you're not! Not to me!
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Okay, sure.
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
And that's every month?
Right! And when is that due?
First of the month.
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Ahhh.
Her answer machine?
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
I know!
Rach! Rach!
Hi!
So you uh, still wondering?
That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
No, we just went out.
You're smart. I like that.
C'mon, she's your mom!
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
No way, forget it.
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Did I not just tell him?
Iced tea.
Okay, anything for you sir?
Yes, you did.
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
Hey, the fight's starting!
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Are you all finished here?
Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
Ooh, I like cards.
Yes.
Great!
What-what-what is so funny?
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
Like what?
I said, "Like what?"
Now that's a thinker.
Never had that dream.
Instead of...?
That's right.
No.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Woah, dude, burn.
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
That you're actually 50?
Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
Y'know what that means?
No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.
Oh!
How could you lose him?
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Dude, they're not objects.
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Oh, now I have to go!!
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
What?
Big fat goalie.
Okay.
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop it -now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Dangerous Liaisons.
Oh yeah, who's playing?
Oh yeah!
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
The players.
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Yeah baby! No baby!
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
No because it-it didn't seem important.
Is he gonna be ok?
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
We already knew that!
Hey!
Hey!
I'm having a son. Um...
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Oh uh, one of the writers.
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Who told you that?
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Umm...
Oh, that poor bastard.
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
You're not gonna be phased out!
Do you want any help?
Are you going to do it?
I'm going to do it.
You come out there, you're a dead man.
Good luck, man.
The Red Ross! Okay.
I don't care! You just get him!
I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
Hey!
Hi!
Why should I help you?!
Hi, how are ya?
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
The reason he just said.
What do you need?
Monica? What time is it?
Hi!
Hi!
Uhh, 9.
But it's dark out.
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
That was unbelievable!
Okay, see? I told you!
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
They're brother and sister!!!
We all hate Emily!
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
What's going on?
Nooo!!
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
These little women. Wow!
Umm, you've got some on your pants.
I'll just throw them out.
Your liking it, huh?
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
Oh you should, it's great.
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
I've never seen it!
This place is really beautiful!
Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.
Number six: the way you smell.
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
Oh, yeah, I do.
Someone you didn't make up!
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Raymond Chandler.
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
What?
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Ohhh, here it comes.
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
I'll take it back tomorrow.
All right!
All right? Thank you.
Thank you.
If I can't have it you can't have it!
Yeah. What are we getting?
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Okay, can we please go eat?
Anything but stew.
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
Takes it out of you?
Wow!
Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
Yeah!
Why not?! I'm hungry.
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Because they'll know we've been listening.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
Movies?
Come on! Do something!
London baby!!
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
I am, I'm ignoring you.
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
I know...
Take the bra off.
Okay, time to take off the bra.
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Okay.
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Thanks again.
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
No, inside good, outside bad.
Yeah! That guy's all right!
Hey!
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
What?
And she's back in the game.
Yeah.
Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Hello Skidmark.
What?!! No I'm not!!
Thank you!
Joey's a sex addict.
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
He just got a divorce right?
Hmm-mmm.
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one.
Ohh yes.
Do we dare?
We dare.
Where are you gettin' this?
Oh no, yeah.
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
Oh. Oh.
Well, hey I did learn.
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Really?
Yeah! Come on.
You meant sex, right?
Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
Do you have a sec?
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
All right, let's go Pheebs.
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
That's okay, Joe.
Oh God!
Bing!
Great! Problem solved!
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Well, back to square one.
Ohh great!! Hello.
Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
Joey there's a girl on the phone for you.
Joey, it's Phoebe. Did you stop Rachel?
No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
Is she great or what?
Ohhhh!! Gross!!
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
So? Huh? What do you think?
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Do something..... Something....
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
Fortunately, I won't. And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.
Hey.
Hey.
Maybe she killed him?
Then how come it is?
They've been quiet for a long time.
Let's go.
Is that your new walk?
Hey! He beat ya.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
So what does this mean?
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
Hello New York!
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
Oh, you didn't see the Post?
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
Why the Post?
No. You?
No. Why?
You got married to fast.
You're not gonna like it.
That's okay.
That's not advice!
I told ya.
That makes more sense.
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
So, what's going on now?
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Monica and Rachel made out.
I can't believe you're getting married!
Yeah.
Morning's here! The morning's here!
Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here!
Because of... the reason.
You can't go out there.
Why not?
And that would be?
I, um, can't tell you.
You wanna make it 6?!
Yeah you got 5 years left!
Joey...
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Hey!
I've got a science question.
Hey-hey, Ross?
Yeah.
Hmm?
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
And everybody knows this?
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Wow! This girl is good.
Okay.
'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
I like her.
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
Well, when it's not right, you know it.
You okay?
Y'know what would cheer you up?
What?
Seven hundred bucks!
C'mon up.
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
What are you guys doing up?
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Dark red.
Phoebe's a porn star!
Sort of...
Guys, what's going on?
What?!!
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
So uh, what's your name?
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Sure, I'd like that.
Its Jake.
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Okay, is there anything else?
She's a woman!
What can I say? She nailed it.
Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
Okay.
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
What's the charity?
We have a half hour.
Hey, mister tux!
Why aren't you guys dressed?
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
No! I'm up for a Soapie!
No-no.
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
See you later, Gene.
Umm, Gene.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
Bye, Gene.
It's Clint! Clint!
Oh sure, right back there.
So, are you ready to go?
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
Hey, where are we going to lunch?
I was thinking Chinese food.
I gotta get the before shot!
Oh man! I did it again!
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
What?!
Well, I like it. Here you go.
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
Oh, I embarrass you?
Wow! The new Playboy!
Oh, yumm!
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!!
Do we need a cake?
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
Yeah, whoosh!
And we don't work hard?
It's work.
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Come here, check this out!
Ross!
What?
What? Is it the comet?
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
Die Hard 2.
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
What'd you rent?
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Hey! Get into gear!
Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here!
Hey! You're back!
Breakfast is near!
The dark of night has disappeared!!
Hey! Any good mail?
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Hey.
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
I don't know, it smells good.
Hi-e!!
Ooh, what do I smell?
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Ooh!
What is the matter with you?!
Oh my God!
Wow!
No! Barry and Mindy.
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
Estelle said I didn't get it.
Hey!
Hey man, how did the audition go?
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
Oh no-no-no, you don't understand...
Yeah.
Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
Listen to me!
Oh yeah, yeah.
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
No, that was clenching.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.
What happened?
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
Oww! Big ring!
Ma! What're you doing here?
I came to give you this and this.
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Hold on, you-you knew?
Well maybe I love ya'.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
.
Hey.
All right, but in the future...
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Oh!
Okay!! Okay!!
Come on!
I know what it did! Nothing.
Ohh, Nothing.
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
Like this.
Hey, opposite, is opposite!
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
He's got nothing!
Okay, I'm ready.
Think it'll work?
I think it's insane.
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
You can not do this.
Yep. Ice Capades.
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
Are you seein her again tonight?
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
Oh, I do. How you doin?
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
I don't think so.
I'm OK
What?!?!
So what're you going to do?
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Oh. That WENUS.
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Sure! It flushes it.
Like this.
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Hello!
That's a good call. Right.
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
You're not going to believe this!
....with??
Funny story!
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Hi! How are the Gellers?
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Don't call us that!
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Do you want me to learn?!
And you'll be topless?
And-Joey!
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Let's give it a shot.
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
Sure, now I'm scared.
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Gimme 'em!
Yeah, did I fool ya?
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
Totally!
So it did go well.
What if we have to pee?
I'll survive.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
I'll cancel the sodas.
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
Yeah! All right? Let's go!
Yeah!!
It's not like we don't know how to party!!
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Yeah!!!
"Happy birthday to you!"
Would you please get some rest!
I'm fine.
You're paying for that.
What? No-no it's her birthday!
Well then, do it better!
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
I am pretending.
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Well, back to square one.
Great! Problem solved!
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Yes!
You could drink the fat.
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
No way! It's mine!!
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
What?! What?!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Face to face, yeah!
I think face to face.
I would say that.
Okay, here I go.
All right.
Ahh, you drive safe.
Happy birthday sweetie.
Ok.
Ross, what're you doing.
I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
It's exactly like it sounds.
Hello?
He should take the sack?
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Well then let me do it!
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
We're never gonna find anybody.
Joe...
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
That's a two line part.
What?
That audition.
Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
So what.
Hat, milk, got it.
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
Consider it done.
He's got the body for it.
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
Really, is he a swimmer?
I like that. What?
You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
I was thinking Chinese food.
Oh sure, right back there.
Hey, where are we going to lunch?
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
Say it... say it!
I want to take my tongue... and...
....and....
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
....with??
Why would you want to do that?
What are you doing?
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Rach, there is a decent place to...
Hey you guys! What's happening?
No, seriously.
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
Oh my God!
What is that?
Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
Hi!
Hey!
Yeah?
How's that going?
Put your hands together.
Aww. Ohh!
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
No more jam?!
So, what did you guys think?
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Phoebs, what's goin' on?
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
Uh-huh.
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Oh, well no problem there.
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
Easy Lenny.
So? I mean have you thought about it?
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Okay. No. But thanks.
Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
Yeah, sure.
So, are you ready to go?
Hi!
Hi!
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
Oh sure, right back there.
Well, now we got a reason.
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Yeah.
What?
Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Take the top down did ya?
Good enough to get fired.
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
All right, you're hired!
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
What?
Oh uh, when?
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Alright open your eyes.
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
No-no, she really is sick!
Bye.
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
What's the matter with Rog?
C'mon up.
Oh, good. Rog is here.
Yeah.
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
"...by doin' it."
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
There you go!
Joe?
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
What?!! That's even worse!!
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
How is that worse?!
I don't know! But it's the same!
Who said it was for you?
Monica, relax, go get a beer.
I don't want a beer.
Hhhiiii.
What's the matter with you?
So I guess you all saw it.
Um, leave.
Wait, wait, wait!
Saw what?
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Damnit!! Did you move?!
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross.
Yes?
Is that the fire alarm?
What?
We're not alone.
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
Cool.
Okay, here we go. Ready?
Okay, get ready to owe me!
Okay.
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
You bet! What's the part?
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
The Ross-Is that back?!!
Okay, you wore me down.
Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Hi!
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
All right, how about the ladybugs?
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
You pick one.
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Go get 'em Treeger.
Okay.
Yeah.
Right. Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Really?
Can I change a hundred?
Miss? May I help you?
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.
Let's ride.
Quick volleyball question.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
Volleyball.
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Won't-won't that take longer?
I'll treat you real nice.
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Yes! Shame about you man.
I'm not even... I'm not even...
Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Stop it!
What?
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
No.
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Hey, let's go look at it!
But it's available now! Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Okay, let's go.
Okay!
Thanks! Let's keep going.
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Hey, that was really good!
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Oh!
And also, we don't know what to do with this.
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Come on baby, come on!
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Very nice touch.
No, never done that either.
Friends first? That's interesting.
You become friends after?
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
You and me, next dance?
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Hey, what's up?
Sweetheart, sweetheart...
Yes?
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Ohh, tough call.
Yeah.
People, people, people.
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Well, people!
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Plastic spoons. Great.
No, we're alright.
So I got ya something.
Lick away my man.
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Hello, Joey.
Oh! ...Hello, dear.
Yeah?! So's yours!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
You're kid's name is Raymond!
How did work go?
Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
No, the quiet down thing!
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
You mean this.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
What's going on?
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
I'm, I'm okay. See.
It's okay, these things happen.
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
How come you didn't come over earlier?
'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
Need a new table.
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
You think?
Hey hey, come on in!
Let me see. Oh, right.
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Joey, this is you!
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
You don't have it anymore?
Well, first it's not a purse.
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Sure. What?
Okay, anytime.
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
I've got cold feet.
I don't want to marry Chandler!
Okay, uh...
...it's gonna be okay!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
Sorry I'm late, what's up?
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
They were in his office.
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
What?
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
What's wrong with the twentieth?
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Ohhh.
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
I don't want to, I'm scared.
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
Hey, you guys!
Hey!
How can they do this to me?
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
A four and a nine.
Really?!
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
You're kidding right?
No. Why?
If you don't do it, I will.
Hi, Just Janice.
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
So, um, what do you do for a living?
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Hey man, what's up?
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
What? Where?
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
Hi!
Hi
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
For real?
No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Okay.
I'll treat you real nice.
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Won't-won't that take longer?
Beth, Beth dies?
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Eh. Beth dies.
Um-hmm.
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
He's doin' some thinkin'!
What's...
Umm, well, he's...
What happened? What happened?!
You kissed my girlfriend!
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
Okay.
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
I'm marrying her.
We'll just see.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
My identical hand twin!
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
What?
What's an identical hand twin?
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
I will not take this abuse.
Look, it was a job all right?
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
Whoa. That was really good.
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
No.
Thanks, any suggestions?
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
That's not funny at all!
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
That's not funny.
Hey!
Hey!
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
What?!
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
You know, I think I was sixteen.
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
Please, just a little bit off the back.
I'm still on "no."
Yes! There's still pie.
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
Hey, he's not crying.
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
Y'know-y'know what I really want?
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
What?
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Why is 10 the highest?
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
No, 10 is the highest.
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
I don't want to marry Chandler!
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
I'm over here big guy.
You did look like an idiot.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
You play hard to get.
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
What do I do now?
She already lives in London.
Then you go to Tokyo.
I don't know. What are you wearing?
Get off.
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
Do we have to know about that?
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Hey-hey, check out the hat!
Hey!
Hey!
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
You?
What?
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
So we are going on two?
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
Okay, one...two...
All right!!
Oh, good job Joe.
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
Hey!
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
No! No! No!
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Jason is not a sissy!
Y'know I have dinner plans!!
Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
Aww, I don't want to see that!
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
I know, it's great!
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Right, I go-, I got it.
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?

Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Is it back in the cage?
Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
I got it!
Its back in cage!
Cage closed?
Okay, may I see the comics?
Can I see the comics?
This is the New York Times.

Ah, poke a nose, mmm
So, did I hear Poconos?
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
So, there was no miracle?!
Your chair?!
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
No Joe, no miracle.
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Oh well, okay, good luck.
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
Yeah.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
She was kidding about that right?
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Yes. Vividly.
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
No, can we get back to me?
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.
Alright. Cab driver number two?
What-But you saw the show!
All right, let's get me back up there!
No! It don't go up on the wall!
Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Dry cleaners?
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Then...who did?
Uh-huh.

She's not crazy is she?
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
Ah!
No.
So uh, how you doin'?
Now she sounded breezy.
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Monica, you don't know that.
That is so not my motto.
What happened to uh, MEG.?
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
Hey.
Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
So, how'd it go?
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
I know the code to his answering machine.
Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.

Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
Mornin'. I said, mornin'.

They were in his office.
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and...
All right, what are we havin'?
Stick to your side!
Hey, come on now!
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Oh, hey!
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Exellent dream score.
Doing it on this table.
Wow!
Why, why, why would you dream that?
More importantly, was I any good?
Yeah, all of us! All day!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Central... Park!
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Hey, there's a dog out there!
Does anybody need more coffee?
Yeah, I'll take some.
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
What?
And now for the great news.
Not a problem.
Thanks.
What, that wasn't the great news?
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
What?! What?!! What is it?!
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Ow!! Ow!!!
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
All right, Ross!
I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
You cuddled.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Huh, I never really noticed.
Monica, Monica is great.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Yeah, well, it feels different.
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
It's clean.
It's dry.
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
Yeah, where the hell is he?
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....
How's this?
'Cause it's a television show.
Oh, I know, I know.
How, how can you be here and there.
Drake, what're you getting at?
I'm not Drake.
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
I had the same dream!
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
I, um, can't tell you.
Because of... the reason.
And that would be?
Joey, what's going on?
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
Not if you're gonna be like this!
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Fine! Get out!
All right Phoebs, way to go.
And?
And we did.
Yay me.
So, so how did it happen?
Dude you said, "No!"
What?!
Yes.
I also said, "Yes!"
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
But, he loves Emily?
Ohh great!!!
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Okay.
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
Oh. Oh, God!
I KNOW!!!
Open up! Open up! Open up!
Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
Okay.
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
All right, I'm going. I'm going.
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
Here we go, here we go.
Rossy, Rossy.
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
For real?
Okay. See?! I told ya!
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
All right, you have yourself a deal.
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
Here, we are.
What? Me having a job?
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
She keeps punching me.
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
But what?
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Hey!
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
What-what is it, what is it?
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
Wow, it's big!
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Oh yeah, I added three.
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
There were only twelve.
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Oh yeah...
I did do it, I'm a professional.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
Then what's the problem?
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
Ahh, to be 13 again.
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Yeah.
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
Well, when it's not right, you know it.
Pretty much, yeah.
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
You okay?
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
No.
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Oh!! Shrimp toast!
Oh, hi.
And I also brought my friend Joey...
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
Spock's birth control.
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
You need these books.
Hey!
You got that from what I said?!
Chandler loves marriage!!
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
What happened you guys?
I don't know! But it's the same!
What?!! That's even worse!!
How is that worse?!
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Still not hot enough!
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
No!
Rachel?
Yeah?
I don't know how to play Cups.
Well, what's it called?
Cups.
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
All right.
Who you what? Who you what?!
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
Yes.
Wow!
How far'd ya get?
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
OK.
Mailbox.
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
Heh, what d'ya say?
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
I'll take it all.
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Great, you can cover Chandler.
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Well, that's really a different question.
I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Get out of here, really?!
What?!
I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
Absolutely!
Yeah?
You wanna see her again, right?
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
They're brother and sister!!!
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
I'm doing my scenes with you?
Yeah! Me too.
Richard? We're ready for you. Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he's playing Vincent.
Nice to meet you Joey.
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
Look, it was a job all right?
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
I will not take this abuse.
Hang up, hang up.
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Is anybody else scared?
You're gonna have to pee on it.
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
What?! What is it?!
What?!! Gross!!
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
You'd better run!
Did you hear that?
Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
Yeah!
The fruit roll up.
Yeah.
What are you trying on now?
And?
Delicious.
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Nooo!
Yeah? What did ya have?
You got a little bored?
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard...
Sounds good.
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
Very nice. Very nice.
So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
Oh well then, good night!
Absolutely!
Oh good.
Good night!
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
Okay, I see what's going on here.
It's 4:30.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
You-you do?
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
That-that is a good trick.
That's a good idea for a business!
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Yep! Grab a plate.
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
You made pancakes?
Okay.
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
It's the off light. Right Ross?
You look pretty tonight.
Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
What, he's 18.
Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Always illegal Joe.
Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight.
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
And that doesn't scare you?
Ross, you need some help?
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
N.Y.P.D!!
Oh my God!
I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
All right, there you go!
I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
Okay, good-good for you.
Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, boy, do they suck.
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
I can scratch that right off.
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
All right!
Well, they go into the chipper.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
So, what happens to the old guys?
Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
Hey! Hey!!
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
Yeah.
Hey, kids...
Ross! They're gonna kill you!
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Well, why are you doing this anyway?
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
Did you get your money back?
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Oh, thank God!
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Wow! You made a profit!
Was his name Angus?
Mornin' Pheebs!
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
What?
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
That guy's still doing that?!
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Kate, do you even like me?
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
What? So you never went out with an actress before?
Of course I do.
Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Hey!
Funny one! That's good!
Okay.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Monica, will-will you marry me?
What? I don't get it.
Yes! And the table is mine.
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
Stop talkin' to your men.
Congratulations.
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
You see this, this is a friend.
Come on, I need your help here.
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Then why would you say that?!
Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
No. She doesn't die.
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
Some girl ate Monica.
Over here dad.
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
Okay!
Bye Joey. Last night was fun.
Oh and I'll call ya too!
Or I'll call you!
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Well have we finished the scene?
As were you.
So I got your car, it's right outside.
Duh, where've you been?
That's, that's nice twice!
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Yes!
So, so how did it happen?
All right Phoebs, way to go.
Yay me.
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
And what did he say?
Aw, I know all about Kip!
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
I have actually not heard of that.
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
Where the hell have you been?!
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
How does she do that?
I cannot sleep in a public place.
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
Yeah?
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
I was laughing.
Out loud?
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Hey Joey!
Hey.
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
What kind of research?
Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
... It's a fertility study.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Huh.
And the Knicks rule all.
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Since when are you into swing music?
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
Guggly worm.
And this?
You make it so funny.
Hey umm, what's this?
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Yeah!
Hike!
Over here!
I almost caught that one!
Ma! What're you doing here?
...No, we hate him.
We're sorry.
I came to give you this and this.
Oww! Big ring!
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
What message?
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
I can't believe this Chandler!
How do you do there, Wayne?
Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
This will just be my batch.
Because the kids need new shoes.
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
Really? To what?
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Oowww!!
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
Hey! Is the show still on?
Well that I can believe.
Yay!
Almost over man.
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Very good! Okay. G.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Fight.
String?
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
Look, what do you want me to say?
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
I want you to say that you like her!
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Okay, get ready to owe me!
You serious?
Oh yes!
Okay.
Okay, here we go. Ready?
It certainly is a miracle.
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
It's the Miracle Wax.
Hi you guys.
Hey.
Why, are you moving out?
Why not?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
I'm not moving out.
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
Yeah but I didn't read anything.
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
I think we've seen enough!
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
So you're really doing this, huh?
Sperm or regular?
Sperm.
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
Sounds nice.
I don't know, it looks the same.
Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
You used to have carpet.
Oh yeah!
I didn't know it was an auction!
That might be fun.
What were you thinking?!
Wh?!
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Can you tell me how this happened?
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
Joey, I really don't...
Well no.
Miracle!
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Well sensitive is important, pick him.
Yeah.
Jason is not a sissy!
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
I love that movie.
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
I can't! It-it's stuck!
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
Well, get it off now!
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
You want to see her again, right?
Come on! You like this woman, right?
Yeah.
Sure.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Hey Erica, c'mon in.
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
Morning. We ready to go?
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
It was a really beautiful service.
I know! Neither did I!
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
I didn't know you had another level.
Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Yeah.
Way to be strong, man!
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
Hey!
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
You want me to lie to Chandler?
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
Is that a problem?
No.
Which, is the new plan!
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Really? Who-who have you taught?
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Well, I taught me and I love me.
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
Eh...
Okay well that's good to know.
Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
Sure, I love this part!
Well he made Rachel cry!
What?! You got us evicted!!
I told you not to go down there!
Rachel always cries!
That's not true!
Mom, so what did you think?
Ohhhh...
That's nice.
Well that was umm...Okay.
It wasn't the best.
Has it been that long?!
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
It's okay, these things happen.
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
I'm, I'm okay. See.
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Hey Jessica.
Hey Jess.
Hi.
'Sup?
Where do you think, Zelda?
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
You found my book?!
Yeah I did!
You guys don't think I look 19?
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
Ahh, the babies miss me?
Who's seven?
Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...
Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.
Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
That can be arranged.
Let's reset.
Let's take it from there.
Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
See, now it's weird again.
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
Fan out! Fan out!
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Aww, you guys are so cute!
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Yes, you are so smart!
I know.
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
All right! Just hurry up!
Yeah!
Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
I think face to face.
Of course it was a line!
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place.
How rude.
So how are things going with Paul?
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
What like Pete Dakota?
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
That's not a state Joe.
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
Because they wanted me to audition!
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Joey, why would you do that?
You! An actor?! That's madness!
Rachel Green's office.
Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
Morning.
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
Y'know, about what happened with us.
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
About what?
Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
All right, we'll start with...apples.
Deal!
Challenge excepted.
We'll be starting with apples.
Stop that now!
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
That's right!
I like it!
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
And who else is going to be there?
Her dancer friends?
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
They didn't fight a lot?
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
None.
No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
In my day, divorce was not an option.
Can I talk to you for a second?!
That's all right.
That's okay.
Hey, Joey.
Hey.
But what does that gonna do...
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together.
For Chandler!
Okay. I'm in.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Yeah good luck, good luck.
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
We love you, we're here for you.
Thanks.
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
Now, don't argue with me...
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
No, you should.
Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
Really?
I know. Ross is getting married.
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Phoebe is, making people.
Everybody's doing stuff!
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
Hey, what's goin' on?
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Not if you're gonna be like this!
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
All right.
Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
I put it on to scare Chandler!
I know! It's stuck!!!
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Uh, if you say so sir.
Well, I'm going to kill you.
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Hold on, you-you knew?
Oww! Big ring!
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
All right! So, was it amazing?
Wow!
Yeah!
It was, it was okay.
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
No, I'm alright man. Really.
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
No, I'm picking you up.
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
He just said, "No strippers."
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
Little village people.
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
What's wrong with PBS?
Ugh, what's right with them?
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
So, we're having fun, right?
Yeah, all right.
Okay.
Yeah.
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Rough numbers?
Well, I think we all learned something.
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
So what're you guys gonna eat?
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
I have nothing to do with casting.
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
Ah, Kate?
Yeah?
I'm probably gonna need those. Huh?
Hey, listen you ah....
What are you guys woofing about?
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Urghh!!
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
So I guess it's Joey then!
I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay.
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
That's right, I have a phone in here.
No no no, behind it.
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
Joey, promise me something.
Yeah.
Hey buddy! How's it going?
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
Hey!
So he likes to break stuff.
Well, he had gravity boots.
Yeah, he broke those too.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
"When can you move in?"
Of course I did.
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Unbelievable
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Hey, you're back too!
Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
No you're not! Not to me!
No! I won't leave you!
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
Oh my God.
What?
Why don't we just go on two.
Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
Okay, on three. One....Two....
Why two?
Because it's faster.
Two brothers, one died!
You-you think?
Did you like learn about her family?
Yes!!
Yeah?!
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from...
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
What are you guys doing out here?
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
The one in the director's chair.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
I just grabbed a spoon.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
What? I-I said you had a-
How'd you get over that teacher?
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Yeah.
I didn't. I got under him.
Problem solved.
You think I need a new walk?
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
What if they don't?
What?
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
All right, I'll take care of it.
What's the matter?!
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
Oh no, wait! Joey!
73! 72! 71!
He-he-he, how's it goin'?
Look at her.
Hi Monica.
Hey nice boobs.
Guys guys, check this out.
What? No-no it's her birthday!
"Happy birthday to you!"
You're paying for that.
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
But it really...
Look, you wanna use our place?
So you ah, ready for our last practice?
Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.
No, I ahh, had another idea.
We did it!!
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Nobody sees the king!
Hey! You can't go back there!
Oh my God.
No, that means nothin to me.
I'm sorry man.
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
Uhhhaahh.
Pecan sandy, just made em.
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
Oh, what did I say?
Hmm, noodle soup.
All right, let's try one.
Hmm, noodle soup.
Not from where I was standin.
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
where were you standing?
Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Someone you didn't make up!
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt.
Great!
Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. Thanks Joey.
Oh, thanks!
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
Aww, you guys are so cute!
I know.
Okay.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
I'm moving in.
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
Boyfriend?
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
G-sharp.
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
No, but you're questioning my method!
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
I won! That was my guess!
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!
What?! What?! What?!
I guessed 20,000!
Your other student, was you!
Thank you.
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
You wanna eat? My treat!
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Yeah.
Isn't that Ross's money?
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Kiss her! Kiss her!
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Come on look guys, don't fight.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
All right! You can have the chair.
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
Really!
Oh my, would you look at that!
She was nothing compared to you.
Awful! Horrible!
She was not good. Not good.
She, she was different.
Ewwwww!
My Giant? I love that movie!
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
You really think this is okay?
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
I'll never get to be a best man!
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
You can be the best man when I get married.
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Maybe she never got your message.
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
There was a seen in Footloose...
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
What?
Flashdance.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
Totally. I'm like 90/10.
Yeah me too.
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
What? That's not? Oh my God.
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
Hey guys.
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
That's a line from the show too!
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
Right! And when is that due?
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
First of the month.
And that's every month?
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
You look cute in bubbles.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
If I can't have it you can't have it!
I'll take it back tomorrow.
Thank you.
Professor Geller?
Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Yeah?
3, 2, 1. Happy New Year.
Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
Kenny the copyboy.
Hey.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
I promise.
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
No, no he's not.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Man, do you know what guys want!
Cupid.
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Who wants French toast?
Hey!
Hi!
Oh, I'll have some!
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
Thanks a lot.
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
You are now.
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
I'm so worried about him, y'know?
He will, Joe.
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
Somebody lose a ring?
Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
Good luck. And I'm still right!
Hi! Wish me luck!
Oh, good luck.
That is sooo not true!
What?
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
Yes.
I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
Me neither, y'know what-
I can't believe you did this.
Chandler-
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
What are you mad at me for?!
I gotta go check something over here.
Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...
Thanks man.
What a baby.
Total wuss!
What are you talking about? Bitch.
Well, John McLane had plans!
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Hey Rachel?
Yeah?
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Come on, hurry!
Why?
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
Ross's parents are my parents!
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
All right! So, was it amazing?
It was, it was okay.
Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
Then you do. Heh, heh.
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
What do you mean?
Yeah it is. . . what?
OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Sure, what do you want to see?
Hey man, what's up?
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
I don't know, umm...
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
I can do that.
Fight.
Very good! Okay. G.
No, my first fan mail.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
Rhythm?
Alright!
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Check this out. Can I have this?
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
How can you not believe in evolution?
Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Well, so, stay for the museums!
But, but wh-what about us?
Last night was wonderful. But I-I can't stay here just for you.
I'm sorry.
Joey, onstage!
I bet it was about her a little.
Oh my God!
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Nice shoes, huh?
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
No! Sam Waterston!
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
But, but wh-what about us?
Wh-wh-what's going on? Wh-what's this about L.A.?
They still want me for General Hospital.
Last night was wonderful. But I-I can't stay here just for you.
Well, so, stay for the museums!
You know what the. . .
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
So how you two gettin' along?
Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.
See ya.
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
Can I tell you something? Me too.
I know!
I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
We're 29, we're not women.
Yeah!
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
Okay, I'm hearing.
So did that do anything for ya?
You too!
Happy New Year, Joey!
Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Come on, I need your help here.
What, forget it!
Yeah, right.
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
You see this, this is a friend.
Hard to tell, I was naked.
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Yeah? That's so nice!
I'll be right back. What was that?
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
What?
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
I came over here to tell you guys.
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
I gotta go.
Oh, it went amazingly well!
Totally!
So it did go well.
Great!
Oh that's great!
Come on man, really how old?!
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Wow thanks!
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
Please, can't you help me out?
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
Friends first? That's interesting.
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
You become friends after?
No, never done that either.
No it isn't, I ate that.
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
Monica, relax, go get a beer.
So don't do it.
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
I don't want a beer.
Who said it was for you?
Sure, neighbor come on in.
Hey.
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
So, is Janine around?
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
Judge rules, no violation.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Ohhh.
Hey guys!
No! He blew us off!
It was the ring!
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
What?!
I know!
Ross, how could you let this happen?
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
You don't think my mom's sexy?
No! I'm putting that in my room.
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Everything? Even the TV?
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
What happened to Janine?
Oh that's too bad.
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
I have never known love like this.
Okay, what do you guys think?
Dude!
You really like it?
Dude! How-how did you write this?
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Here, I brought you some flowers.
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Thanks!
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Shut-out!!
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Yeah, get out!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Well, I did not know that.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
By me?
Oh, no!
Come on you guys, one more time.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
Ok. One.
Nooo.
Have you been here all night?
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Y'know, there's two women dude.
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Show me where?
Right-right up here.
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Oh, I know.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
What's the game?! What's the game?!
Okay!
This is great!
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
They're green?
When do you think we lost her?
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Monkey lover!
Probably around gonorrhea.
Hi, honey! I'm home!
Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't.
Okay. Four.
That's a low one!
What make you think I can?!
Okay. Okay. Ace!
Alright... I've got to go shower.
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
Allright!
Hi.
Oh, hey.
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
I gotta go.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
I know. Ross is getting married.
I figure my character has kids.
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Weird world. Your kids?
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
I know.
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
No! Never! Never! Bye.
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
Okay. But not about this!
No touch! No touch!
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
What? Mine aren't tinted.
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Chandler!!
What?
So, you'd hire me, right?
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
For what?
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
All right!!
Hey.
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Yeah!
Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Hello, Joey.
Oh! ...Hello, dear.
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Any contact?
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Hey!
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Wait. Give him a minute.
Sure.
See, I told you they don't swim.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
That's because all people are selfish.
Well, may I ask for one example?
Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
Are you calling me selfish?!
Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
I'm not listening to you!
What are you mad at me for?!
Me neither, y'know what-
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Chandler-
You gotta let me slam the door!
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
Yeah, y'know the license plate game?
I love the license plate game!
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
Hey!
You'd better act surprised.
He's planning your birthday party.
Oh my God! I love him!
About what?
My surprise party!
And you feel like we hold you back.
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Yes.
Oh!
Beth is really, really sick.
Ow!!
What?
Awwww.
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Hey Rach.
Joey.
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
I think that would be best.
Okay. But not about this!
No! Never! Never! Bye.
He cut off his ear.
Well, this is much better.
So, here's somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
And?
I'm out.
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
Oh my God.
What?
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Uh, we might be leaving now.
What? What can't you do?
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
No. Rosita does not move.
No. No. No.
No?
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
As in Rosita does not move.
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Okay!
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
I can't find the remote. Thank you.
Hey Phoebs.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
And?
Saw a girl with that vest.
Thanks. You ready to go?
Yeah.
Thanks.
While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Okay, time to take off the bra.
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
I think you're done.
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
Take the bra off.
Hey, do we do this too much?
You hug me!
All right!
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Yeah.
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
Hormones!
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
Sooo?
Are you bachelors?
It's not what you think, that was...
Who?
Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
You told me I was the only one.
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
Did I say you could smell it?!
Yeah, okay.
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
I can't smell your sandwich?
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Will you quit hoggin' it!
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
My chair heels itself.
No. Really?
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Hey guy!
Come on man, you're not a potato.
No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Well, it's nice to know that you...
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
Sure. Yep.
What's he doin' in my section?
Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
Hombre?
I guess he doesn't know.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
Good. Hey.
Hi.
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
What happens if you flick it?
So what's it shaped like?
Yeah, is there a hair on it?
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
I didn't finish my five pages.
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Joey's not going.
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Damn! I am good at Cups!
No. Why?
Well that's a full cup!
I'm not talking to her!
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
Now, wh-what, what is that like?
It didn't.
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
Yeah, yeah.
I found my identical hand twin!
Pheebs!!
Yeah?
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
No!
I can't believe you're not picking me.
What about me?! You-you just said I could!

Well....
Goodnight.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Yeah!
Thanks!
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
The Celtics.
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
What?!
You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
He's back! The peeper's back!
Brrrrrrr!
Hell is filled with people like you.
Get down!
Get down?
Hey-ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
Hey!
Hey!
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.
How do you feel?
Our place, the hall! I...
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Where?
I got something for her. It's a book!
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
It's a buffet man.
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Needs some clothes altered?
Hello? Hi.
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
She's not even cold yet!
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
That's true.
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Hey, where's Chandler?
Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya.
All right, we have to pick captains.
Here you go.
That almost hit me in the face.
And then Tineals.
Okay, so how do we decide that?
This is it! This is my category.
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Yeah, I got my speech!
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
I have actually not heard of that.
Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
What's the matter?
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Ross, how could you let this happen?
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
Well... not in the same way...
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
Thanks, any suggestions?
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
You totally screwed him over.
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Vomiting stories are funny...
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
Somebody wanna help me out here?
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
Oh, I know, I know.
How, how can you be here and there.
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Yeah... ....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
Yes, we do.
Alright, check.
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
From a bullet!
Much sense?!
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
And last but not least.
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
Hiiiiii.
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
Maybe you should.
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Get out your checkbook, mister.
I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
I've got five bucks says you can't.
Oh, I think I have the cash.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Because! You're mean on the boat!
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Why not?
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
Well, you know Chandler.
Dude! How come you took off?
Bye!
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
Is something wrong?
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Oh yeah, I got a cat.
I don't want a cat!
Yeah.
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
I look more like him than you do!
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Wow.
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
I-I can't handle this, you guys.
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Here we go again.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
All right Pheebs, your cab's ready.
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
Hey! What's up?
Hey!
Hey Joey!
Erin! Still here!
I don't know why you just don't say left.
Nope.
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
Okay, go to the left. The left!
Huh?
Sure. So how long you been...
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
Since then?!
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
Ohhh!!
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
What?!
Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
Oh well then, good night!
Good night!
We have got to move!
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
What-what is it, what is it?
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
All right.
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Oh my-Oh good God!
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Hey! Is the show still on?
Almost over man.
Why am I looking?
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
Yeah!
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Here we go! Here we go!
Hey!
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Hey! Hi!
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
That's not what she said last night.
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
See? Now, he could date her.
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
And of course, crotchless panties.
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
Aw, I love that.
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
Or! You can just, y'know...
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
What the hell are you doing?
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
Do you want me to want you to care?
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
Do you?
What?
I think I left a donut up here.
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
Where do I know you from?
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
Well look, if you don't like this...
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Francette? What is she? A couch?
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
Yeah?
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
No!
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
Oh, that's great!!
Joey!
Say that to him and you're golden.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Hey!
Hey!
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
See?
Hm-hmm.
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
Come on! You like this woman, right?
Alright, now you say something.
I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Yeah.
You want to see her again, right?
A woman in a man's body.
Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
That's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
Much better.
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
I want to go on a ride along!
You got to go on a ride along?!
Uh-huh!
Me too!
Okay!
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
I know!
Wh-what?!
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
It looks like a women's purse.
Really? A purse?
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Oh my, would you look at that!
All right! You can have the chair.
Really!
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Okay, I'm sorry.
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
I'm so happy for me.
Hello?
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
Damnit!
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Your make-up!
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
By someone besides Monica?
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
Yeah, sure.
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
What award are you practicing for?
Really?
Yeah.
Grammy, Best New Artist.
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
Huh, I'm just saying...
Well don't just say.
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
Yeah.
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
On TV?! Yeah!
'Kay!
Dude, you soooo need this car.
Well actually...
No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine.
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
Oh I don't-I don't know.
Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Huh?
Check out the rack on this chick!
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
Show me in the table.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
Ohh, get these things out of me!
All right. Very good.
Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Yeah?
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Hey Monica!
Hi!
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
So really, what'd ya have?
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Hello.
Oh, "you do, do you"?
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
Hey!
You made pancakes?
Yep! Grab a plate.
The Irish gig guy?!
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
That is correct.
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
Gentlemen, you're pick.
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Yeah, big!
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Monica.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
Can we please turn this off?
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
And there is Kevin.
Noo way, Kevin.
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
... It's a fertility study.
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Who's your friend? He's hot!
All right! Hey-hey!
Hi!!
Thanks man.
Hi.
Yeah you got 5 years left!
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
That was like 5 years ago.
Joey...
You wanna make it 6?!
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
Hey!
Hey!
Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Hey.
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
It's almost as if he knew.
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on.
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Really?!
...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
Okay.
And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Come on, quite yankin' me.
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Nope, not this time.
I'm not yanking you.
This is Janice.
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
No.
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
I'm a man.
It'll be great for next weekend.
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
What?
I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
I don't know, they're just a little blah!
Blah?!
Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
That's weird.
What?
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
What about the closeness?
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
He's planning your birthday party.
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
About what?
Oh my God! I love him!
You'd better act surprised.
Animals dressed as humans.
Fears and Pet Peeves.
What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?
That's correct. Ladies?
Same category?
no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
....yeah... what else?
That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Joey, please.
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Let's go watch it at your place.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
You're fake laughing too, right?
Hey, all right!
Pretty cool, huh?
Oh, the tears are real.
You look beautiful this evening.
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Yeah!
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Why not?
Because it's weird!
Sure, what do you got?
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
Oh thanks!
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Yeah, I don't think so Joe.
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Nothing, why?
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Hey, Phoebe.
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
Woo-hooooo!!!!
Wooooo!!!!
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
What's twisted?
Me going out with Richard's son.
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Is he okay in there?
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Sure.
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
Hey!
Joey!
Do you have my credit card?
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
Ross? You okay?
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
What difference does that make?!
Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
I totally don't know what you're talking about.
Whoa! I kinda liked it.
Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
No.
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
I can't believe you bought this.
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
What are you writing?
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
No, they-they weren't in the play.
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
How do you do. Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! Did they have representation?
We're not actors.
Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face and her chest I could really put something together.
So Pheebs what's this guy like?
Oh.
Hold on.
Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
'Kay, here you go.
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
You're driving me crazy with that!
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
Okay, I'll stop.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
Okay, fine!
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
Yeah good luck, good luck.
Thanks.
Ohh, what is in that?
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
I wanted to go to the strip club!
I don't wanna.
Please?
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Yeah, all right.
I say push her down the stairs.
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
Hi guys!
Hey!
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Without me?!
What are you talking about? Keep it!
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
It's not that far! Just drop!
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
It's still looks pretty far!
Do not rush me!!
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
Yeah.
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
No, I had sex in high school.
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Well, what is it?
What?!
Are you sure?
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
Well, I'm not gonna talk because...
Damnit Carl!
No, I had sex in high school.
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
So, so, what'd ya think?
There he is!
There's our star!
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
I-I wasn't in that.
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
No.
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
Amy!
Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Oh!
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Yeah well, we'll see.
You kissed her.
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
I came over here to tell you guys.
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
I guess so.
Here you go. Thank you!
Many are scheduled to appear.
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Okay, I'll go!
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Oh.
So, I hear you're single now...
That's Fergie baby!!
Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
How did you? How? How?
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Hey.
Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
Oh my God!
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
You guys are messin' with me, right?
You or me?
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
Yeah.
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
So what does this mean?
I'm gonna have to give him up.
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
What?!
Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
2 hours, 27 minutes.
Really?!
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Looks like a fun gang.
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Hey, Lowell.
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Who is it?
It's Phoebe.
Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Services? Oh, services.
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye.
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
So have you called her yet?
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Come on, tell me.
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
So?
Yeah?
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
This is like the temporary robot, right?
C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
Nice to meet you Mac!
No. Why?
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
That is incredible! You are the master!
Yes.
Is it a meatball sub?
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
Well, may I ask for one example?
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
That's because all people are selfish.
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you?
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
No, you're the best.
I am the best.
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
Sure, neighbor come on in.
So, is Janine around?
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
Does it have to be a whole day?
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
And six others.
There you are.
Wow!
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
Hello, Chandler Bing.
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
But, I love you.
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Really?! How much?!
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Why? What happened to him?
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
No, inside good, outside bad.
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
She's one of us now.
My whole family's from Naples!
And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
Yeah.
Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie...
Joey, this is awkward part.
You just give him a spoon baby!
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Yeah, I don't know.
What's the matter?
Does it have to be a whole day?
Okay. I'm in.
Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
Me too, we should get goin'.
That saves us a conversation.
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
Rachel, that's all we do.
Says who? Your mom?
Do you wanna play football?
Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
Yeah.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
How do you figure that?
With this ring? No contest.
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
That's sweet. Could I take her?
What's wrong, sweetie?
Nothing, nothing.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
So this is Brooklyn.
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Mine!
All right. Uhh, international.
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Not even on page 7?
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
What?! Why?!
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
Here, I got five, I got five.
Fifteen.
Alright, here's ten.
Thank you.
Good luck.
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Ask me what?
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Excuse me?
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
Yeah.
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
I had one.
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Really? Who's number two?
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Wow!
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Uh-oh!
Joey?!
That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
Oh, I'll get it.
Gotcha!
Sorry!
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
If he goes first he can!
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
You can't do that!
Hey!
Hey!
You got to go on a ride along?!
How are you?
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
Uh-huh!
I want to go on a ride along!
Let's see what else he'll do!
Well, yeah.
You were gonna drink the fat.
How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
Stop it. Stop it!
I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Wow!
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
Okay.
Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
Yeah?
Hey, stripper!
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
You're meeting Richard?
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Great!! That's great!
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
Hey!!
Hey!
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Right this is staging.
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
Thanks.
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Hello?
Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
Oh! Yeah!
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
All right, let's get me back up there!
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
I did.
No! It don't go up on the wall!
What-But you saw the show!
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
Hey!
Catch any big fish?
Oh! God! Wow!
You stink!
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Just being friendly.
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
So why don't you give me your number?
I talk in my sleep.
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
Okay, ready?
Yeah.
No! Year! Happy No Year!
Three, Two, One!
Cut!
Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!
Hey! Look who I found!
Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
I like to see the previews. The candy.
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Well now what's the rush?
Oh. Hey!
Well look who's here!
Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
Ahh!
Hey now!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Okay, great.
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
They gave me the shaft all right.
Yeah?
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
Yeah!!
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
I know. They were mine.
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
That's weird!
If anything should happen to him...
Oh my God!
Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
Oh dear God, let me think.
Wow!!
Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
No!
Come on.
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
They did it right there on the couch.
Ohh, I know one thing!
What?
Hey Ross!
Hey!
But you're spittin' all over me man!
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Oh, thanks.
Well of course I am!
You know you've been spitting on me?!
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
No it isn't, I ate that.
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
That's a good story, Grandpa.
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
So what are you gonna do?
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
Curry.
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Excellent hole, Joe.
Ow!! Ow!!!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
It's a beautiful thing.
What's this?
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
I know.
Well? Isn't that amazing?
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
Anyone mind if I save this?
Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is... Thank you, boys and girls, you've ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother's crab cakes! Excuse me!!
Hey!
Hey!
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Bye!
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her...
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
I want to go to the bathroom.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
Yeah! She's right in there!
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
Guess what?
You got a job?
We could climb Mt. Everest!
Everybody's doing stuff!
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Really? Who-who have you taught?
Well, I taught me and I love me.
Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Why? What happened now?
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Uh, hang out?! How long?
What?!
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
No!
I know! That's why they trashed me!
Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
Oh, you're sweet and cute.
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What?
We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Hey!
What-what's up?
Yeah baby!
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
Okay, the last thing...
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!
I got it! Scotch... tape.
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
God I'm just a horrible person.
Wh-why?
The silk? Feels really good!
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Yeah!
Hey!
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
What?
Yeah.
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
I'm still on "no."
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
What's goin' on?
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
But it's $2,000.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
That is not a problem.
Oh, get out of here!
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Uhh, Monica?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Okay!
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Okay whatever.
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
Well maybe we just take that one away.
Ah.
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
I fell down an elevator shaft.
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
What?
I just got off the phone with my sister.
Come on!!
Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
Ah, which, which one?
Mary-Angela.
What are you in love with her or something?
Yeah?
I wish I could talk to her.
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Hey!
How did it go with Erin?
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
No you don't.
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
Yeah.
These got left for ya.
Hello?
Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
So what do you want me to do?
Hi.
Hi.
Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
Let's ride.
13.
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
What?
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
What?
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
What?!! That's even worse!!
Check out the rack on this chick!
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
Huh?
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
No, I'm not!
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Lifeguards.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
Wow! Look at them run.
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
Oh that's great!
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
How come the writing is in Spanish?
What do you got there?
Condoms, dude!
Don't read my condoms!
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
PBS telethon.
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
I'm in.
Me too.
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
Ok. He kept my dollar.
He-he-eyy.
Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Any progress?
God Joey, this is taking forever!
What's the rush? What?
Cookie, now you can punch him!
All right.
You've got it.
What?!
Hey!
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
What picture?
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
They break your heart, don't they?
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Oh, I see.
Y'know, I don't really their permission.
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Oh.
I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Or you could end up with everything.
Ooh, I like that.
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
Oh, Kim, Hi.
Uhh-huh.
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
It's uh, right through there.
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
Yeah, it sure is!
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Okay!
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
Im sayin I see a difference.
Ive never done that.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
Theyre twins!
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!
You're the only one who can save her Drake.
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
It's Erica.
Maybe he's. . . gay.
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
That's okay.
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
Then you hold on to it!!
All right, man!!
You're Frank's best man?!
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Well, it's better than us deciding.
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Any minute now.
Hey, this- Heyy...
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Go.
Uh.... bean! Bean!
Yes!
That, you get? That, you get?
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
I-I-I'm leaving the show?
Who told you that?
Oh uh, one of the writers.
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
Yeah! Oh my God!
Here you go.
Great!
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Ring dammit, ring!
Thanks.
What?!
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Which guy?
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Lets not do that any more.
Hey guys! Hey!
Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
Nope.
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
Oh yeah.
Oh!
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
That's weird.
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
The shipment never made it through Omaha?
You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
It's between us and the sea, Ross!
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
What the hell happened on that beach?!
Hi, Ursula.
Hey!
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Yes. Yes.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
Yes.
You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that.
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
It's not that bad.
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
It's happened to you?
Yeah! Once.
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
You're so welcome.
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
What?
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
How's she doing?
She?
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Yeah, check out the ring.
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
Huh?
Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
Wait a second, I could star in it!
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Or that.
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
You are gonna be fine, believe me.
Uh-oh...
Hey, is Chandler here?
Yeah.
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
No way! It's mine!!
What?! What?!
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
I can't believe we're living here!
What?! What-what is it?!
I can't believe we live here!
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
Hey!
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
But it's available now! Isn't it?
What about that circled one?
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Yes, it is.
Hey, let's go look at it!
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
Are you naked in there?
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
No, no, this is the first time.
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
How do you mean?
Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
Hang up, hang up.
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
How might you be wrong?
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
That's all you're basing this on?
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
I don't know.
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
She's not Rachel.
Why would he turn off the TV?
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Oh no-no-no-no!
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
So let's decide on the spending limit...
I was thinking more like a hundred.
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Stop picturing it!!
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
What, like there's a rule or something?
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
It's, uh, it's Paul.
As in Rosita does not move.
No. Rosita does not move.
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
....Are we still talking about sex?
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
Well, she has issues.
He doesn't do much, does he?
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
No, this is pretty much it.
You guys wanna get some coffee?
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
That is so funny. Let me see that.
Are you ok, Ross?
He paid a lot of money for it.
Ah that's a cantelope.
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Hey!
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
You got all that from saline solution?
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Phoebe that's crazy!
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
Thanks.
So, I guess this is it.
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
You wanna see her again, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay you're right.
Yeah.
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.
What's this?
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
We make fire. Cook meat.
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
Men are here.
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Ewww!
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
You still can't stand her can you?
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Umm, well, what else could it be?
Oh cool! You made him cry!
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
It's kidney stones.
Or?
So when do we get to meet the guy?
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
Oh, come on! Come on!
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
Who was it?
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
Yeah!
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
Ohh...
Why are you taking this away from me?
Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
I got it! Here we go.
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
Candy Lady?
No not Candy Lady.
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
You won't boss me around anymore?
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
I won't boss you around.
And you'll be nice?
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
Yep, pretty much.
You-you're gonna get married?! I mean... We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
Heyyyy-What?
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Hey!
So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
I'm goin' home.
What?
Goodnight.
So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
Ohh, get these things out of me!
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
I do too! I do too!
Argh!
You went through my personal property?
What picture?!
The picture of my wife! In your pack!
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
See, now it's weird again.
I wanna rock and roll all night!
Really? I don't...
Sing!!
Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
Morning!
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
I'm a dancer.
Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Oh, hey let me.
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
...teen!
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
: What do you need, what do you need?
Fifteen.
What are these, like famous chickens?
Wow, look at these prices.
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
So, does that mean the audition is off?
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach.
Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
What?!
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Hey! How's it going?
Good.
Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
I was thinking more like a hundred.
Oh...
I know. Hand me a tissue.
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
What?!! No I'm not!!
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
Night, you guys.
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
What's the matter?
Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
I'll give up my ticket.
All right, huddle up, right over here.
Wow! Just like in the pros.
Huddle up.
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
Okay.
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
How do you know that? How?
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
Why not her?
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Joey that is horriable.
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Your favorite!
Yep! And lot's of it!
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
All right! But, you do it with me once.
We are! Help us!
Help!
Joey!
Didn't think so.
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
You're not on TV.
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Hello New York!
The guy still won't put out, huh?
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
Sorry Phoebs.
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
Yeah!
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
What was that?
What?
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Oh, good.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
That's not European!
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
Stop that now!
Yes!
Diet soda.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
You know you've been spitting on me?!
But you're spittin' all over me man!
Well of course I am!
That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
Wow! Didn't know that.
Was the chord at least right...
Uh-huh!
Wow! Cool!
No!
Oh my God!
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
Oh.
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
Oh, this is not that bad.
You can totally, totally live on this.
Yeah, yeah.
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
Hey!
So I got your car, it's right outside.
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
As were you.
Why? Are we done for the day?
That's what you told me.
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
How's that going?
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
Pheebs...
Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
Great nap.
It really was.
Excuse me.
Morning!
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Alright, alright, alright...
For what?
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Hold on.
Ross? You okay?
Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Honey! Dinner's ready!
Your favorite!
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
That guy's still doing that?!
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
Yeah?
Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
How do you know that? How?
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
Hey! Oh.
Hi, Joe.
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
What?! Why?!
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
Thank you. Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Just a, uh... hearing disability.
Oh.. you don't get it!
Whaddya got there?
What's the score?
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
Morning.
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
It came up.
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
Geez, look how fat she got.
Helloo!!
Oh, my, god!
Hey, it's everybody.
Janice, you're--
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
What is going on?
We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
Joey!
What's up buddy?
Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
Yeah, okay.
Yeah?
Yeah!
Okay.
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
Yeah, okay.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
Hey uh, what's a matter?
I talked to Janice.
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
What do I do now?
You play hard to get.
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
Yeah, but without the costumes.
Oh.
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Oh my God, is it really that bad?
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
Oh.
Those two only had each other!
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Ooh!
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
Which time?
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
You mean you didn't get it from this?
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Why? What happened to him?
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
Okay.
So I guess it's Joey then!
You're right! That did cheer me up!
What?
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .
Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
I'll be in in a minute.
Goodnight.
Um, thank you for the gift.
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Oooohh that's interesting.
Throw in the duck too!
What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
We don't make enough fun of you already?
Hey!
Oh my God!
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
You do know that Wham broke up?
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
Well, she graduated from high school!
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
She was?
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
Fine!
All right well, I'd better take that back.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Yes, but you are dead inside.
Wh-what, why?
We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
He took my essence!
Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Get out your checkbook, mister.
Oh, I think I have the cash.
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
All right well, I'd better take that back.
Wh-what, why?
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Absolutely not.
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
No, I will not!
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Oh, why is it unfair?
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Well, I-I could live without it.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Hey Monica, it's Chip.
It's all London, baby! Here we go.
Yep! You got the tickets?
Oh! Got 'em right here, check!
You got your passport?
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Maybe you should.
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Oh, that is so not true.
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Hey! What's up?
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
We have to find the rest of the platoon!
Yeah, sure.
Okay, all right. Let's do it. And...Action!
Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone!
What?!
Home is Home Star stew.
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
Hmm, bummer.
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.
Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.
Are you crazy?
Hey.
What?
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
We've got to do something!
What?! What is it?!
You're gonna have to pee on it.
Me too! Me too! Me too!
How much did I love The King and I?
Chandler!
Just stop it! Come on!
You okay there man?
All right now, memorize it. You got it?
Okay, pick a card.
Okay.
Oh yes.
Is that your card?
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
How do you do. Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! Did they have representation?
No, they-they weren't in the play.
I've never slept with someone for a part.
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Well is she...
Sorry.
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
That doesn't lock does it?
Oh, Joey! Sorry!
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
All right!
Really? That's great!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Oh.
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
No, I'm not!
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing.
Well, let me see.
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
Joey, some people don't like that.
Chandler's wearing panties.
But you got to be with both of them, right?
Oh-oh, absolutely!
It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Not the other one?
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Oh, we could do this all day.
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
What party?
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
Who gave you that hickey?
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Breathe, breathe, breathe...
Oh, no.
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Have you been here all night?
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.
Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.
Two pizzas?!
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
No.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
I did pay for half of it.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
Uh, yeah.
So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
They're gonna do it together.
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Ahhhhhhhhhh...
Hello children!
Okay.
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Well, he made a move on me.
More coffee over here, please!
Well, what happened?
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Yeah.
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
What's wah-pah?
Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
That's what I did. Wah-pah!
You can't do anything!
Did she just ask me out on a date?
Bye!
Bye Janine!
I don't think so.
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
No! I'm not okay!
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
No!
No!
What?!
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
Yes! There's still pie.
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
You, you are gonna love this.
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
There you go. Thank you!
No.
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
I can give it a shot.
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
Hi!
Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you...
Ah!
She's not crazy is she?
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Hey Monica!
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Yeah, it's great.
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
Okay!
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Might wanna try Joseph.
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Hey!
What-what's going on?
Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
So uh, what's your name?
Its Jake.
Yeah, big fan.
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Rach, there is a decent place to...
Why would you want to do that?
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
No. No. No.
What about Game 1 of the Series?
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
What about Benitez?
What about shut up?
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
Oh, little party favours, check it out!
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
Hey-hey, what are those?
Wow! Yeah!
Oh-oh!
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
Right. Could you sign this?
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
How can they do this to me?
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Yeah you did.
Okay.
Yeah?
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
You want some help with that?
Whoa! Are you okay?
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
You look fabulous honey, you really do.
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
For what?
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Thank you!
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
And you knew about this?!
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
Plus, you look cool.
Well, I just called Joshua...
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Sure, what do you got?
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
A mirror?
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Francette? What is she? A couch?
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Might wanna try Joseph.
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Hey.
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
No, nothin'.
I hope she's OK.
How do you know exactly what she's going through?
She told us.
Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
No.
No, thank you.
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.
Well what is it? Is it a mole?
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
We could get that Everest video though.
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
Yeah, well...
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
And the place looks so nice!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
She is gonna hate me.
Yeah, well...
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
Pheebs!
At least I care about his feelings!
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
What?!
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Hi honey, how did it go?
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
So, I guess this is it.
Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Oh, Urse...
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Hm-mmm.
$4.50 please.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Uh-oh.
What?
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
No it is not!
What are you talking...
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Yep! That's hilarious!
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Course there, they just call it food.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
I know.
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
Hey guys!
I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Do not give him any money!
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
What kinda change?
I can't do that!
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Yeah.
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Okay, here we go...
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
Really?
Yeah! Look!
What do ya say? What do ya say?
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
Do you have any respect for your body?
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Oh, you're sweet and cute.
I know! That's why they trashed me!
What?
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Oh...
What are you guys doing here?
...What did I ask?
Hi.
No, no... how come you are working here?
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now Im here.
Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
Can we start over?
Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from...
What?
I am extremely talented!
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Oh, somebody will.
You're kidding.
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Really?
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Look, it was a job all right?
Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
Yes. Not out loud.
Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
Yeah?
Man, this is...
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Why am I looking?
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Oh Joey!
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Wow! Look at them run.
Yeah, I'll go get one.
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
So, system kinda broke down huh?!
Bye-bye.
Bye!
Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I...
We want you to marry her!
Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
Two pizzas?!
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
You'll see.
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
No!
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
Great!
Oh that's great!
Oh my God!
Wow!
Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.
Hey, hey, hey no.
Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Are you crazy?
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh.
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
No.
Joey, did you my face cream?
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Okay.
Sure.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
So you ah, ready for our last practice?
Hey Duck, is Chick here?
Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.
Look, you wanna use our place?
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Hey!!
Hey!
Okay. It's a chicken.
It's cute, huh?
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
I did pay for half of it.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
You're gonna mess it up let me do it.
That sounds perfect!
Yeah.
I'm not gonna mess it up.
If she says no, can I have the ring?
Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .
Oh, yeah... yeah.
I'll be in in a minute.
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .
It may not be a bed of roses.
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Joey.
Rachel.
And you're no friend to those with noses.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
That's nice.
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
All right that's it, school is in session!
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
My God! Is this a gym card?
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Because! You're mean on the boat!
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
Hey, listen you ah....
Hmm?
Umm.
Kate?
You got all that from the back of her head?
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Who's Elaine?
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Okay, here's your penis!
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
So?!
Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
Hey.
Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am...
Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
In the box.
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
What, what is it?
Can you be my dancing partner?
His dancing partner?!
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
...Then I've already seen this one!
Are you through with that?
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
It's textbook.
Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
Hey, how long are you in the city?
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
I can't believe you would say that!
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
I don't know.
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
What?
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
What?
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
I know.
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
Monica?
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
You left a shoe here?!
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
I think it's great you guys are doing this.
Well, we are great guys.
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
What?!
What?!
Please!!
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Well, he didn't tell me.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Yay!
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
You did it! You got ordained?!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
Well Rachel's not here!
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
Son of a bitch!
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
Yeah, right.
Get out.
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
How about a scone on the house baby?
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
I'm pretty.
Hey does anyone have any gum?
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Are you saying I smell bad?
What's with him?
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
We're not gonna lose to girls.
Hey! It's 42-21!
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
Yep! Grab a plate.
Okay.
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Why, are you moving out?
I'm not moving out.
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Aw, I know all about Kip!
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
Taste it.
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Hey!
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
Home is Home Star stew.
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Hold on, you-you knew?
Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
Hi Tushie.
Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
You mean like a doctor?
Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
Hi.
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
You cook naked?
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
What's the matter?
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
What?
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Have you been here all night?
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Hey!
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Vomiting stories are funny...
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
What? A brain transplant?!
It's ridiculous!
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
What?
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Oh my God, is it really that bad?
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Yeah.
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
What? Where?
What am I looking at?
Somebody help me out here!
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Yeah!
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
Why don't you ask him out?
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Um-hmm.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
What do you like better action or comedy?
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Okay.
Action.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
All right, let's do it!
No, no, no. What was that?
Well, people!
People, people, people.
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Pat Sajak?
Yep!
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Rhythm?
No, my first fan mail.
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
Totally.
Hi Joey.
Hey! How you doin'?
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
What? What?
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
Huh?
Just sit over there!!
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
I get the dollhouse!
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
No, just a barrel.
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Come on man! You've been here all day!
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
We're on in 3, 2,
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
Ooooh.
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
I can't believe you're not picking me.
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
We can't do that.
What? What can't you do?
Uh, we might be leaving now.
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Let me get that. You got five bucks?
Oh.
Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
I love you too Chandler.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Karen.
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Really?
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
Sure.
Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
Okay.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Yeah, you're right about that.
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Hey guys!
Hi!
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
Hi!
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
What?
You practice losing the Grammies too?
Hey!
Y'know?
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Ah.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
You see this, this is a friend.
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Yeah, that makes sense.
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Serious?
Are you scared?
Ross will do it.
Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
No I-I-I'm fine.
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Okay.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
And a date with a man!
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
What are you doing?
You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
What?
What?!
No!
Oh no!
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Hey! Happy birthday.
Thank you!
No he didn't.
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
You spit on me man!
Look, I'm sorry.
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Oh, right!
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
Absolutely!
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
Is that a real thing?
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
What's up?
So you've just married the one time then?
Yeah, little Eric.
That's right! Wait no, Ben.
Well umm...
You've been married twice?
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
That's fine.
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
I'll take that.
You want his yearbook?
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
Pirates again?
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
When's that?
Tonight.
You take your time.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Yeah!
Do you know something?
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
What?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
Ross, you don't have to yell.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Yeah.
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Oh my God!
Nooooo!
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
Yeah.
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
I'm a party planner. I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay!
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
She seems really, really fun!
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
What did I tell you about the hall?!
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
Play it.
Ok, all right.
What?
Ssshh.
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
You got it! Oh-oh!
What are you doing?!
Thanks. I think you got it!
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
We didn't change..
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
Oh my God you stole her award!
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
"Take good care of your Momma son."
Okay.
Action!
Cut!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
What?!
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Really?
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
Right, I go-, I got it.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
What's the matter?
Wow!
I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
You knew about this?
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
All right everyone, lift! And slide!!
Hey Joey, can I...
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
Pheebs! There you are!
No it's not, sorry.
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
Yeah, all right. Ooh!
Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
Thanks!
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
A film in Guadalajara!
The airport?
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
No! No, the robots just work for them.
All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
I can't kiss anyone.
So I'm kissing everyone?
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
All right, then you owe me $350.
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
Mine!
Wait! It was my plan.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.
Which, is the new plan!
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Great!
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
That would be no.
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Cantaloupe juice.
Exactly.
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
Not unless different means the same.
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
What was that?
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Time is money my friend?
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Yeah, but this is
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Your last roommate's kidney?
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
Lemonade? You ok man?
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me.
Ohh...
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
It's Pam.
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
Hey.
It's a little early to be drinkin'.
Ohhhhh!
You're kidding?! That's great!
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Why did they get divorced?
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
Eeeee--ohh!! God!
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
Joey, you don't have too!
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
See ya tomorrow!
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Ooh, something hurts!
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Hello.
Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Joey we know you steal our food.
I'm good.
So, er... how did it go with Celia?
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Oh, I was unbelievable.
All right, Ross!
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Oh, classy.
Yep! I sure know how to pick 'em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
Really. What?
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
All right, then you owe me $350.
Joey...
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
Well, what are you going to wear?
Huh. Does Monica know about this?
I don't think so.
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Joey! Joey, good one!
That's good. Very good!
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
It's Erica.
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
G'night.
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
How was your conference?
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Hi!
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
All right, see you guys.
Look out kids, he's coming!
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
What? Me having a job?
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Also an island.
Hey, what time is it?
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
What kind of smell?
I don't know. Soap?
Yeah.
You wanna see her again, right?
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
Oh, I love museums!
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Vulva?
Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
Yeah.
Oh, there's our stop.
You guys live around here too?
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Yeah. So...
So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
Okay. Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
But you said one.
I meant, me plus one!
All right, I'll see you tonight.
Okay.
Alright. Cab driver number two?
No, can we get back to me?
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.
You're welcome.
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Thank you.
Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Why not?!
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
Oh Joey!
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
Hey Pheebs.
Hey!
Well, these really are the days of our lives.
Yeah!
I'm so happy for you!
What?!
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
How young is young Ethan? Young?
Off to see young Ethan?
Thank you.
He's... our age.
When we were?
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
Hello, Chandler.
Margha.
Mar-klan.
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
And yet, we're still poking him.
He does not look happy.
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
No.
Whoa. That was really good.
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
I sort've already asked Chandler.
Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
Uh-oh.
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Well.
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you?
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
Spiderman?
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Oh for cryin' out loud!
Well now what's the rush?
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
Oh, me too.
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Who knows?
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
You knew about that?
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Yeah
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
You mean Dr. Geller?
Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
Well, how-how come?
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
Hey!
Hey!
And the place looks so nice!
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
You are playing American football?
I'm Dutch.
Hi-hi, I'm Joey.
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
I own this store.
So, does this come in another color or...
I'm moving in.
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
You're Frank's best man?!
Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
I'm the ring bearer.
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
No, I will not!
You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
Hey guys.
Hey.
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Oh yeah!
...so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera!
When did that happen to you?!
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
Oh yeah, yeah.
I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
So, can you trust me?
No.
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Whatever.
Fine.
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
What was that?
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
Yes! My baby's finally free!
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
What?!
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
I will, I will find him.
Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?
Just the last two pages.
All right.
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
... And where's this money coming from?
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
This is so cool!
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
No, look.
That's a pig.
Hey!
Emily's cousin kicked me out!
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game!
Oh.
What are you guys doing?!
Cool! I'll catch up!
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
What is that noise?
You!
What kind of changes?
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Okay.
Hi!
Hi!
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
Hey!
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
God! What are you, in second grade?
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
I'm sorry, why don't we do that right now? He's right here.
Okay.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Alright, now try taking a puff.
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
I'm so sorry.
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
I knew you were not okay with that.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Nothing.
Yeah. Oh.
What's wrong?
Your sister stood me up the other night.
Hi.
Trouble?
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Well did you try calling her?
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
Maybe because you've got the keys?
Porsche.
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
IN LONDON!!!
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
I highly doubt that.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Hello, funny Valentine.
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
You'll have a last kiss.
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Whoa!
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah me too.
I know. Yeah.
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Yes! Well that-yes.
Why else would we be here?
We actually missed it.
Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
Central Perk?
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.
Hey-hey, what are those?
Oh, little party favours, check it out!
I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
Y'know what?
Umm?
I've got five bucks says you can't.
Get out your checkbook, mister.
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Hey.
Thanks. You want it?
Huh?
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Oh, OK.
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
You're jokin' right?
Thank God you're pretty.
Hey!
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Okay, there.
Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
And there you go!
"...when I look back over our time together..."
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Monica...
Yeah?
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Nothing.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya.
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
Hey, where's Chandler?
Chandler? Chandler?
Hey!
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
No one.
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Bodington's!
Bodington's! Woohoo!
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Maybe on some level.
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
It's a buffet man.
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Sure! What's up?
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Yeah!
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Bye.
Right, I've got to be off, I'll see ya. Buh-bye then.
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
What?
Hey, how, how did you do that?
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
But then you left.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
Hey.
Aww, is it broken?
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Oh, oh! It's on again!
Shhhh!
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
Heyyyy-What?
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
I think I'm gonna cry!
He forgot to leave his grip size!
What're you guys doing out here?
Well, not playing raquetball!
He didn't get the goggles!
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
No!
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Well, only if you order stuff.
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
When's that?
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
Well, things change.
It'll be okay Joe.
I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are.
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
And thank you for your time.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Hey!
Hey!
Honey, we have been through this before!
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Well sensitive is important, pick him.
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys.
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
Yes! My baby's finally free!
Woohoo!
How hot are we?
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Five years.
You've sentenced him?!
Joey, the guy's your best friend.
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
Yes! And the table is mine.
Congratulations.
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
What's Phase Two?
How does going to a strip club help him better?
Because there are naked ladies there.
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Okay.
Are you thinking about Monica?
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
Hey, is Chandler here?
No, no he went for a walk.
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
Ohhhhh!
You're kidding?! That's great!
Oh my.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Fine with me.
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Which do I like?
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Yeah, it's great.
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
I call Godfather!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
Yeah?
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Honey, I was wondering....
Hmm?
Wh-wh-what's going on? Wh-what's this about L.A.?
Hey!
I'm soo glad I caught you, I couldn't find you before.
They still want me for General Hospital.
But, but wh-what about us?
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
What?!!
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Cupid.
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Hey, you're not Kip!
Do you even know who Kip is?
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Oh, that poor bastard.
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Good luck!
I see.
Thank you.
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Where the hell have you been?!
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
What?!
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Hi!
How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
I see.
Besides, there's a big age difference.
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
Ahh, yes.
Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
Okay. Okay.
I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me.
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
I'm Joey! How are you doin'?!
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Who the hell is Carl?!
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
So are you actually gonna see her again?
I am gonna see her again.
Damnit Phoebe!!
Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
Huh?
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
Hey.
Hey.
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
You got it! Oh-oh!
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Oh!
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Just, just say what you feel.
Marcel, I'm hungry.
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Okay.
That's ok.
What's goin' on?
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
Phoebe, that stuff is...
Don't even get me started on yours!
I did.
All right, let's get me back up there!
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Thank you!
Some uh, some visual aides.
Please don't say naked chicks.
Why not?!
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Carol?
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Hi!
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Yeah!
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Yeah.
Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. .
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
It could happen.
This will be your phone.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
So what. I say, punch him.
Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
I'll do it.
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Why not?! I'm hungry.
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Hey!
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Ohhh, yeah, me too.
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Well, only if you order stuff.
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Whoa!
Oh my God!
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Yeah well we should order some food then.
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
That sounds fair.
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Someone like an...angel?
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
What are you saying?
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
I'll treat you real nice.
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
Oh my god.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
We did?
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Okay, here I go.
All right.
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
Okay, great!
All right.
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Who wrote it?
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Yeah.
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
It's like two miles!
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
We've got to do something!
Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
He's taking her purse!
Oh, there they are!
All right, get a room.
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
Yeah?
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Francette? What is she? A couch?
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
I'll never forget you Hans.
Fired! Why?
The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Oh my God!
Oh my... God?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
So, what happens to the old guys?
Well, they go into the chipper.
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Don't come out here!
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Okay!
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
See ya!
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Hi, guys!
Hi!
Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
What?!
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Hi!
I don't think so.
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
Are you serious?
Yeah
Ewww! And "Oh no!" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
Huh.
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Hey!
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
Uh-huh, what?
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Thanks man.
Okay man.
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
Bye bye Joey.
What a phony.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
So, are you sorry that I told them?
No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
Oh no.
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Hi.
Are you okay, sweetie?
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
No-no-no-no, we're done.
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
You got all that from the back of her head?
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
What do you say?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
Hi-hi, I'm Joey.
I'm Margha.
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
Hello, Chandler.
I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are.
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
It'll be okay Joe.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
That little naked guy would be me.
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
For three years?
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
I was in too much pain.
And then Joey remembered something.
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Ahoy!
Hey! How's the boat?!
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
The oven is on.
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Well then get it, get it!
That tone will not make me go any faster.
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Right. No big deal.
Okay.
What code?
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
No. Why?
So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
Oh, you're sweet and cute.
I know! That's why they trashed me!
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
I'm intrigued.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
Oh! You got it?!
What was it for?
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
And then Joey remembered something.
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Ewwww!!
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Well, I've got a girl in here.
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
Hey!
Hey!
Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.
Thanks.
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Yes.
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
Yeah, I don't think so Joe.
All right, I guess this will be fine.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
I, er...
I want to take my tongue... and...
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
What's a 'niffle'?
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
You make it so funny.
Hey umm, what's this?
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Okay.
Here are the audition scenes.
Why would you think that?
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
What four of us?
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
You?! And-and you?!
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
I'll take it!
That might work!
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Wow, you look...
No time for that!
Well, I've got a girl in here.
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Well we'll see!
Bye-bye!
Yes. Yes. Just here and there .
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
No! No! No! I was so careful!
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
Um-mm.
Real magic does exist.
Wow.
You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.
No.
No, thank you.
I'd love an ice water.
You got it.
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Kinda.
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
I hate this thing!
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
There was a seen in Footloose...
Flashdance.
She was a welder.
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Oh-I don't know.
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
Whoa, she's pretty.
Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
I don't believe this!
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
That's true.
Okay? You ready?
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Oh, I can't watch this.
Really?!
No-o-o!!
Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
I'll take her back tomorrow.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
There's another carton right over there.
Alright, so what's it about?
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
That's interesting, but check this out. I date her...
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Yeah well we should order some food then.
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
What's up Joe?
Yeah?
...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Yeah.
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Let go!
No! You let go!
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Yeah but I didn't read anything.
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
So uh, here's your office set!
Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
What?!
Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
Have fun.
Bye.
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
Dude you said, "No!"
I also said, "Yes!"
No! Ahhh!!!
I don't believe this!
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Dude, you are sick.
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
Uh.
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
Oooh, what you got there?
Pastrami.
Hm-mm, corn beef.
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
She's gone.
What?
What are you talking about?
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
Your different here too. Your mean in England.
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
What the hell!!!
what's up, Dad?
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Aw, dammit!
Back on in 30 seconds people!
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Come on man! You've been here all day!
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
No! I balanced my checkbook.
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
We should really learn how to play the real way.
It's a pretty cool tux.
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
I like our way. Oh! Chess!
Nice move.
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
Yes.
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
You do?
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Hey-hey listen...
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
What, to blind my child?
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
No.
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Monica...
"...when I look back over our time together..."
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Aww, thanks man.
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
That.
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Did not, she did not wink at you....
Huh.
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
Okay.
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
No, the quiet down thing!
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
I do NOT want this unit!!
Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
Hey!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
You just give him a spoon baby!
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
You're kid's name is Raymond!
Yeah?! So's yours!
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Too dry.
No!
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Wouldn't she?
Would she?
Guess who?
Hey.
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
Okay.
Six months.
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Isn't this great?!
Don't spoil it.
Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
That's the whole part?
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Okay!
No-no
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Done.
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
Really?!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Yeah, but don't you think....
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
That tone will not make me go any faster.
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Well then get it, get it!
Joey!
That one will.
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Thank you, Joey.
No-no, thank you.
Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.
Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
What do you like better action or comedy?
Action.
Dude, you are sick.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
Lose the robe.
Me?
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Well, hey I did learn.
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
I'll take her back tomorrow.
Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Again?
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
Well?
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
No.
Yeah, okay.
You mean dying man?
Yes!
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
Man, this is...
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
Oh, he sees her!
Oh, he's catching up to her!
Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
Cause I already invited her.
Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Oh yeah, come here.
Oh, that's mature.
Uh-huh.
That's right.
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
Uh.
What?
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
He doesn't have anyone.
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
You're a genius!
Now, there's two reasons.
Hey.
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
His daughter was hot.
Gotcha.
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Umm, Gene.
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross.
Yes?
No. I'm all alone.
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
Huh?
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
Y'know-y'know what I really want?
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
You wanna eat? My treat!
Isn't that Ross's money?
I don't know.
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
What is this? What's going on?
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
Joey's!
All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
Yes.
So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
Yeah, whatever.
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
Hi!
Hi!
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
Yeah.
Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
I am your friend.
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
Bye-bye!
Okay, I need a date!
Oh!
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
You are a frightening, frightening man.
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
Let it go!!
Hey!
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
Your pants!
Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
What?
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Yeah.
You wanna eat? My treat!
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
I guess.
Hey, save us some pizza.
Stop talkin' to your men.
Yes! And the table is mine.
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Much sense?!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Oh my.
Hey.
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Okay whatever.
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Consider it done.
You understood that?
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
What's going on?
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
Oh that's so sweet.
So we both finished our vows.
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
Stick a fork what?
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
No, no, no, no, no!
You are playing American football?
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Oh God!
Really?
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
Hi.
Hey.
Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
And what are you going to do for him?
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Okay, so when do you want to go?
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
What did you get her?
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Me too.
Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
What?!
Flexible hours.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
He took my joke, he took it.
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
Oh!!
That's great!
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Nothing!
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
I'm...happy...for you?
Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
That's what you say about porn.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Well, so why not go knock?
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
Yeah?
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Why not her?
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
I'm Joey.
Kristen.
Kristen.
Got it! So...
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
So are you gonna tell him?
Why would I tell him?
Oh...
What are you guys doing here?
Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
Yeah.
Do you guys want these?
Yeah!
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
That's sweet. Could I take her?
With this ring? No contest.
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Uh-huh.
Do not give him any money!
I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Hang on buddy!
I sure did.
Why?
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi there.
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Heh?
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
You didn't get the money, did you?
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
Nobody sees the king!
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Okay.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
No!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
Delicious.
Joey!
What?! Which one?!
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
What?
Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
Chandler.
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
What kind of smell?
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
Well, I don't know!!
We fell asleep! That is all.
I think that would be best.
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Okay.
All right, so, okay...
Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?
Right!
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
Kitten?
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
This bottle opener.
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
Okay.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
I do not hate Ross!
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Arghhhhhh!!
I'm over here big guy.
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak.
Thank you.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
That's what you told me.
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
Is that my ass?
There he is!!
G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Go Joe!!!
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
Can't we just use a pen?
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Well, that's really a different question.
I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
What?!!
Excuse me, there was no time!
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
Your company has a fine foods division?
It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...
No! No, the robots just work for them.
All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Hi.
M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
It's still looks pretty far!
It's not that far! Just drop!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
God!
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Okay.
Oh yeah man. Joey.
Hey. Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go.
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Unless...
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Okay then!
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
Oh yeah, no problem.
Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
Well, now we got a reason.
What?
All right.
Hey uh, what's a matter?
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
Not on you! On the stripper!
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Was his name Angus?
What?
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway...
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Come on, they're close.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
I don't want to hear about her!!
No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
Ohh great!!!
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
Hey!
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
Well, what are you going to wear?
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
Oh, so, how are we doing?
Bored and bored!
Noo!!
So what's Phoebe like?
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Gotcha.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
Heh, what d'ya say?
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Put it on.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Okay.
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
You are way off, pal.
Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI...
Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
Oh my God.
Woah.
Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Ahh.
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Here you go. You can wear this.
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Oh, me too!
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Really?!
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Good luck! Go get 'em!
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
I don't know.
Why am I not surprised?
I don't think you have much choice.
Well we'll see!
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
Vomiting stories are funny...
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
No!
Still not hot enough!
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
You think I'm hot?
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Oh, excuse me.
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
So, you'd hire me, right?
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Big night!
This is so cool!
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
Hey Erica, c'mon in.
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?
Who?
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Can I do it to you?
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
We're never gonna find anybody.
Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
What?!!
Excuse me, there was no time!
Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
Does anybody need more coffee?
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Okay!!
Done.
Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!
Thanks.
Why do you need it?
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Nooo, later.
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
You're kidding, no!
Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So...
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
You're one to talk.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
Oh god.
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Okay.
Hey!
Hey!
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
The airport?
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
Eight months.
That's a really long time.
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
Okay. Let's do it again.
Okay.
COME ON!!!!
Y'know what? We need to move on.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
That's not specific to girls.
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
I have an oily T-zone!
That's right.
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
No kiddin', hmm.
What?
Really? Why?
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Kiss her! Kiss her!
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
Nope, not this time.
Come on, quite yankin' me.
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Hi, it's me.
Oh, my, god.
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
She seems fine now.
...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
Yeah.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
Uh-huh.
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
And this goes for all guys?
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
That's still in there?!
Is this a service you're providing me?
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
They gave me the shaft all right.
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Cool! I-I'll see you then.
All right.
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
Yeah, no, it was great.
What?!
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
What are the odds? What are the odds?
Okay, that-that's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
Okay, my turn!!
Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
"...when I look back over our time together..."
Yeah?
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Yeah!
Hey!
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
Does for me.
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
What?
There was a seen in Footloose...
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
Oh, well great.
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
That's right my friend. It's time for...
Baywatch!!
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
What are you doing?
The key's stuck in the lock.
It still doesn't work.
I'm not finished.
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
What?! Which one?!
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
Yeah!
It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Any luck?
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Uh-huh.
The silk? Feels really good!
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Hi!
Hi.
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
This is your place?
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
Ugh!!
What happened?
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
What?!
I don't know. Me neither.
Yeah.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
So?!
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Oh right, right.
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
How do you do there, Wayne?
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
Nice to meet you Mac!
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
I've never lived like this before.
I know.
What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
Uhh, I can't.
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
No, I think you should tell them.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
You're turning into a women.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Yep! And lot's of it!
Okay, in we go.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
...look both ways before you cross the street.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Hey!
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
Chandler's gone again!
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Ohhh, here it comes.
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
All right, I'm gonna go!
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
Uh, Phoebe...
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
Yeah you do!
Rings?
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
I love you. And I know about the baby.
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Yeah, I'll go get one.
Well, hello!
Hey.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Ohh we're not sailing.
Just pull on it.
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?

Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
Dude, they're not objects.
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Okay...
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
Alright open your eyes.
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Congratulations!
I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Are you kidding me?
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Ok, here, I know what we can do.
Hey, hey, hey no.
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
You guys. You suck too.
Hang on buddy!
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
It's actually going to be just family.
Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
What about Benitez?
What about Game 1 of the Series?
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Ask me what?
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Who?
Wow!
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
Yeah?
I thought your time ran out.
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
Oh.
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
Yeah...
What happened?!!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
That's not good.
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
The green dress? Really?
Nooo!
Hey. Got a second?
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
This is disgusting!
I'm not reading this!
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
What were you modeling for?
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Hey!
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
Sur-surprise.
...Monica.
Yeah.
My whole family's from Naples!
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
Thank you.
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
How's the hired help?
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Are you saying I smell bad?
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Sign here.
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
You want me to lie to Chandler?
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
What?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
It's nice that he has someone.
Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
Yeah, but it's my wax.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
I'm not coming back.
Why not?
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
I will not take this abuse.
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Oh my God, what's goin' on?
No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Thanks Ross.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Well, you're gonna.
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Do we have to know about that?
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
She's comin'.
It's me.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hi.
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
See? Now, he could date her.
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
That's fine, thank you.
Next.
Name?
Holden McGroin.
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
What?
What?
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Pheebs?
Yeah?
Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
Beth is really, really sick.
Awwww.
Joey?
Yeah.
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
I think you look fine.
Whenever you're ready.
Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Come on, it's fun!
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
Sorry.
I'm sorry Joey.
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
I know, it's great!
Aww, I don't want to see that!
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
Hey!
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
No, but you're questioning my method!
Thank you.
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
Yes! .... or no.
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
Why?
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
You're driving me crazy with that!
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
He does not look happy.
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
Love....
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Unless!
Unless what?
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
Glass of fat?
No! Do you wanna hear it?
Am I in it?
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
It's not mayonnaise!!
What's this?
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
What are you playing with?
Oh, it's my new beeper.
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
Ahh!
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
You got a better idea?
Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Just a, uh... hearing disability.
What's the score?
Beautiful!
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
You.
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Well maybe we just take that one away.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Ow!
Toothpick?
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
Not once!
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
I'm a dancer.
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Thanks.
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Yes that would be lovely.
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Really?
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
I can't do that!
Yeah, but this is
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Who needs a lease when it's family!
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Yeah.
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Good enough to get fired.
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Is this a service you're providing me?
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Who is it?
N.Y.P.D!!
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
Im sayin I see a difference.
Theyre twins!
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Yeah.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Hi, Pheebs!
Hey!
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
That's right my friend. It's time for...
Baywatch!!
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Can I get you something from the bar?
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
Well maybe I love ya'.
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Jeez, what a baby.
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
You could drink the fat.
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
"Oh, my, god."
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
We won. We won!
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Thank you, Monica.
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Oh my God, what happened?
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
Or! You can just, y'know...
What the hell are you doing?
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Good-bye muscles!!
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Hey.
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
What?
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
What?
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
What happened?
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?

No! Sam Waterston!
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Horn-swoggle.
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
Yeah, you don't want that.
No!
Oh I a lot of stuff!
You got a little bored?
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
God, I love these fingers...
Thank you.
No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
What?
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
What?
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Hey!
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Well, I like it. Here you go.
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
Die Hard still great!
What'd you rent?
Die Hard 2.
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Like what?
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
A swimmer!
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
Ascot!
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
You pushed him!
Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
Uh-huh.
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
You know the hotels?
In 1981 you were 13!
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
You went through my personal property?
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
Cut! Wonderful!
Great scene yeah?
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
He will, Joe.
I'm so worried about him, y'know?
Somebody lose a ring?
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
Hi.
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Hey, I went up.
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
Five letters.
Rdtor.
So she's a woman! So what?
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Okay.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Cat.
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
Well, you're just gonna have to try.
Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
Chandler!
Hello-dillillio!!
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
Ohh, what is in that?
No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
Hey, hey, no, oh oh.
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
How's Monica coming along with her vows?
Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
Ahhh!
Are you gonna play?
You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
Ooh-ho-ho!
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Yeah. O-okay.
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Well, I said it loud.
It is okay, if I stay and watch?
Well, that went well.
I think so.
Page 42, page 42, page 42.
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
Ooh, I look good.
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Hey Pheebs?
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
So you really OK about all this?
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
In the moment, yeah.
Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
No.
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
Ooooh, nice.
Oh, yay!
Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Well, yeah actually.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
Yeah but I didn't read anything.
I think we've seen enough!
Hey, is Rachel here?
No.
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Are you sure?
Maybe your scene's coming up?
Yeah.
I'm in it.
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
That's true.
The man's got a point.
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
Run Phoebe run.
No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.
Are you kidding me?
Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
All finished!
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
Oh my god.
What?
So, you and Angela, huh?
Yep. Pretty much.
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Hi.
'Sup?
Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
All right, we should call somebody.
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
Oh man!
What?
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Oh my God!
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
Hey!
Hey.
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
Yeah, sure.
By someone besides Monica?
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
What is your job?
Staying out of the way.
There were only twelve.
Oh yeah, I added three.
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Bite me, blondie!
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
What's the matter?
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
What's going on?
He's retiling my floor.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
But I'm the host!
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
Well, here's your phone doctor.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Let me see that! Oh man!
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
Yeah! Okay.
: That book got me through some tough times.
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
There is a little child inside this man!
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
That is true.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
So what, we just sit?
Hello, Chandler Bing.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
Really?! You think that will work?
What the heck is that?
Did she call?
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
No, can we get back to me?
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
There she is.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Rach, these are for you.
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
OK, Phoebs, your turn.
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Exactly! Unisex!
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
That's OK.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Who are they killing off?
Noo!!
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
Woah, dude, burn.
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
Oh-oh, that's your thing.
What?
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
All right, there you go!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Oh, just years of experience.
Can I get some ice here?!
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
Say what?
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
Hey!
How'd the callback go?
So what'd you do?
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
Let's see, ahhh... Where does the Pope live?
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
Spock's birth control.
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Joey, why is your cable out?
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
What's up?
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Really?
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?
Oh.
But how about tomorrow?
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
No!
Sorry!
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
But it's dark out.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her...
That's interesting, but check this out. I date her...
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
It's gotta be the first one.
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
That's not a question.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
That is so sweet!
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Right.
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
You're gonna have to pee on it.
What?!! Gross!!
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Oh hey!
Oooh!
I get to hire my own assistant!
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Havin' some trouble?
Rachel locked the door.
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Ooh, it's not bad.
Okay.
Hey! You okay?
Ooh, something hurts!
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Hey.
Sorry.
And the bunny got away.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Hey Gunther.
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
Do you still work here?
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!


C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
That is lucky.
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
You are soo enjoying this.
You know the words! You are so into this!
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Yeah, we are so sorry.
You're kinda stepping on the song.
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
So let's decide on the spending limit...
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
No she hasn't.
Well, what am I going to say?
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
1200.
Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
Uh, the dog.
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
You're it! Now run and hide!
It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
I say, punch him Joey.
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
Joey!
Esther Livingston. Gone.
Hi, Phoe.
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
Right. Could you sign this?
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
Cool, thanks.
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
And?
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
Really?!
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Yeah!
Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Is this guy great or what?
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
So you're not homesick yet?
No, I don't think so.
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
What four of us?
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
She's right! You have to stop!
What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Oh no, no, no, no.
What, what is that?
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
Hi!
Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
Joey!
Good for you!
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
How often do you read it?
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
That was me.
Oh, en chante.
That's me.
Ahh, yes.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
That's right!
But at least the apothecary table is real.
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
That's totally understandable.
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
Hey! I got great news!
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
No.
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Yeah.
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Oh, hey.
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Hey, I'm back!
Hi-hi Joey.
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
Yes.
Wow!
It's not a big deal!
They were lovers.
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
And no one touches the air around the TV!
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Oh no-no-no!
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Hey!
Hi!
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
Oh-no-no-no-no....
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Yeah.
Five.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
Oh my God!!
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
It's not charity, Joe...
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
Excuse me?
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
I didn't know it was an auction!
Wh?!
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
I don't know! Charity?
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
Get away from me I said no!
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Bye.
Bye, good luck.
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Really? A purse?
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
So?
Oh, good point.
Yeah!
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Tell it again. Seriously.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
Well, I think we all learned something.
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
Well, that's great.
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
Hey, Rachel.
Hi!
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
Wheel!
Of!
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Yeah, big fan.
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
Here!
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
It's uh, it's already been roasted.
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
Okay.
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
Yeah baby!
But, we pick again! We pick again!
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Go on.
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
Yeah?
Oh my God. I mean...
He's holding us back.
Totally.
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
What?
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
I got glasses!
Well, you-you've always had glasses.
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Wait a minute!
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
Over a month.
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
I don't want to do that.
Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Hi!
Love your condoms my man.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
It's called the cherry.
It's the-Chandler!!
Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
Oh-ho, yeah!
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
I was afraid of that.
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Okay.
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
I so am.
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Well, this all looks good.
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
Hey! Hey!!
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
No, sorry.
All right, maybe I should call her.
He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
Huh? Uh...
Dude! Dude!
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
What?! Tonight?!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Oh my God you stole her award!
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
Our place, the hall! I...
I got something for her. It's a book!
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
I know!
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
Okay.
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Whatever.
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
Oh hi!
Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
I think it was valued at 19,000
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
We're very happy for you.
What's the matter?!
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Joey, speed it up!
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Yeah.
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Oh that would be great!
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Wh-why?
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
I am dressed.
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
No! God, would you just calm down!
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
This will be your phone.
No you answer it and take pledges.
But I'm the host!
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Oh!
My God!
Excuse me?
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
We came over as soon as we saw.
How could you not tell us?
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
Thanks.
How good is that?
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Man's got a point.
Crazy bitch.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!
We have one.
I know. Use it.
Excuse me?
It's me, Joey!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
You don't know?!
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
Thanks!
Yes, very nice Rachel.
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Hey.
Urse...
Listen, um...
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
No, I just, I fell down.
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Why-why would I care about that?
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
All right, sorry.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
No-no, she really is sick!
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
Hi.
Hey.
That was 14 hours ago.
So how'd it go?
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Oh that would be great!
Joey, you don't have too!
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Really?!
Thanks.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Joey!
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Nothing?
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Oh, right, that's me!
Fine.
Phoebe, what is it?
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Ok, that's enough.
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
Feel better now?
Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
What?
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
Sure, what do you want to see?
I don't know, umm...
Umm, no thank you.
What's with her?
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Tell me about it.
Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
But Mon, you have to get our money!
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Okay.
Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
Chandler!
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
So, what're you gonna do?
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
I've never slept with someone for a part.
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Many are scheduled to appear.
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
Okay.
Okay, now I'm really late.
Bye.
Bye.
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
Whoa! Are you okay?
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
Hey-hey.
Guess what, I got an audition!
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
You bet! What's the part?
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
What kinda things have you been saying?
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?
Right, I go-, I got it.
So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Hey, nice toilet.
No no no, behind it.
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Erin! Still here!
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
I know!
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Phoebs, what's goin' on?
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Well, so why not go knock?
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Won't-won't that take longer?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
That's right.
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
Okay!
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
What is it?
I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
What, what's that?
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Hey! I made that for her!
You made pottery?
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Yeah.
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
Really?
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
What about the closeness?
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
How did you make $17.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
You do?
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
Thank God!
Oh, I can't go.
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Me?
That would work.
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
North route!
Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Hey!
Oh, this guy again.
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
Hey!
Hey!
What is DOOL?
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
What? That's impossible.
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Here's your tea Phoebe.
It's so good. Oh, thanks.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Okay, take it easy.
Hey! That's my car.
What-what are you doing?
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
Hey.
Hey.
Sure.
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
Sure! Where is it?
Ohh! So you're 5639?!
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
Look, look, I have elbows!
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Pshhshhh!
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Where in Cuba?
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
That cold makes you sound so great.
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Well, I want it!
You can have it!
Oh, no! No!
It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Wooooo!!!!
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
Come on, take 'em off!!
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
So, I hear, you hate me!
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
Ross, you need some help?
From you? Yes, please!
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
No thanks, Josephine.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Oh Jack stop.
C'mon, it's my birthday.
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
Fine!
Yeah!
Hey!
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
You have pets!
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
Sorry.
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
And I just want a million dollars!
It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat.
It'll be great for next weekend.
No, no, no, this weekend guys!
What's going on?
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
What?! That's the first time today!
Ohh!
I'm 16.
See you in 2003.
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Really?
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Yeah?
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
Come, come here.
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Excellent, I'll be there.
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
Sing!!
I wanna rock and roll all night!
Morning!
Hey!
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
That's a hernia.
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
Seriously, what-what's the part?
C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
...I'm his
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
We could eat the wax! It's organic.
Oh great, food with hair on it.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
We love you, we're here for you.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
...Flame Boy.
Where exactly is your zoo?
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
What?!
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Joey, did you my face cream?
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Where do you think, Zelda?
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
Thank you.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
She's still asleep.
So how'd it go?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Shhhh!
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
And there is Kevin.
Can we please turn this off?
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
What about Game 1 of the Series?
What about shut up?
Okay.
So how's it goin' with Joey?
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
You do, huh?
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
All right, see you later.
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
Umm, okay.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Hey, opposite, is opposite!
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
What's going on?
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Uh, Joey..
Oh, God!
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
And heels.
No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair.
Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Okay, in we go.
Here you go.
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
You totally screwed him over.
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
Hi Daddy.
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Those two only had each other!
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
There you go!
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
Its Phoebe! Hi!
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
It's a different building.
Why don't we start right now!
Okay.
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
No.
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Sort of...
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
Pretty good.
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
Wow! Didn't know that.
Great!
Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
No. No, I haven't seen him.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Why can't you tell her?
Joey! Joey!!
Yeah?
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Oh, Judy. Oh, Judy.
Oh, ohhhhh.
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Alright open your eyes.
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Beth, Beth dies?
Um-hmm.
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
What?!
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
Hey!
Sh-shh-shh!
Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
Oh, Chandler.
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Sandy.
Yeah. That's okay, right?
Par-tay!
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
I'll remember that.
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
Oh.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
I don't know Rach.
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
How ya doin'?
Who in the hell are you?
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
I haven't seen him in so long!
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
What happened to Janine?
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
Dry cleaners?
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
This is amazing.
I know.
OK, Rachel, I'm ready.
OK.
Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Do we have to tell her?
Yes, we have to tell her!
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Well, there you go.
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
What kind of problem?
Oh my God!
Nooooo!
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
What is going on here?
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
We're so sorry.
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
All right, you have yourself a deal.
Okay. See?! I told ya!
Here, we are.
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Tell him it's for you.
Feeling a little better sweetie?
Me too.
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Hey!
How was your first day?
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
No, I think that was the whole all.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?
Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Noo! NO!
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
All right!
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
So what'd you do?
Good for you.
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Why am I looking?
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
Oh Joey!
That's right!
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Hey Chandler!
Hey!
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Hey.
Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
Why not?
Because! You're mean on the boat!
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Hey!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Yeah!
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
What?!
For all the free food you gave away.
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Hey!
Drums?
No! Drums!
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
Who wants French toast?
Oh, I'll have some!
Oww!
What's the matter honey?
I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Everything? Even the TV?
No! I'm putting that in my room.
What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
Throw in the duck too!
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Look, we are not gonna...
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Okay.
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
You do?
Yeah.
What?
Yeah, she broke up with me.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
That is the Coast Guard.
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
All right.
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
Give me that!
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Thank you!
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
Joey, bravo!
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
I am definitely gonna watch that!
What about these? These look the same?
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
See you in 2003.
You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
Yeah, thanks.
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
No I won't.
You don't even know!
Well look, if you don't like this...
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
Yes!
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
There's an image.
Would anybody like more coffee?
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
Now she sounded breezy.
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Hey!
What's up?
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Oh well, okay, good luck.
Yeah.
Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
Okay.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
You call that delicious?
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Okay. Hut! Hike!
Fumble!
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
That is so good! Do it again!
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
No no, that's me.
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
Ma?
Joey!
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Are you naked in there?
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
Hi.
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Well then, do it better!
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
No, sorry.
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Well, the duck...
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
Go ahead.
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
Okay.
No-no-no-no!
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
Who was it?
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Sure!
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
I'm sorry.
: Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
You don't drink.
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
You guys are messin' with me, right?
Yeah.
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Maureen Rosilla.
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
So what.
So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
Toilet paper?
Yeah.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Ow!
I'm outta here.
Really?
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Hey...
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...
Yeah, right!
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
Oh my God!
What?
They don't?
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
Games and stuff.
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
There's an ad for a naked chef?
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
You have to respect the sea!
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
Oh!
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Come on!
I can't believe this!!
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Yeah! She's right in there!
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
Yeah.
I'll take it. My gift to you man.
Here are your cakes.
We didn't order cake.
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
What-what are you doing?
But it's my car!
Yeah, but it's my wax.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Hey Pheebs.
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Okay, I'm totally cool!
Come in.
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
So...Thank you.
Could you be less enthused?
Like?
Charity.
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
Someone in here.
Where's Chandler?
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats.
Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
Come on! That's great.
Wow!
Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
I know!
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
Yeah?
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
What? You mean behind my back?
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Wow, he looks so normal.
He's even kind of cute.
Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
Oh, my.
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
Fine with me.
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
No, not getting my bra!
Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?
The one in the director's chair.
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
How could you have told her?
Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Okay!
Too dry.
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Aw, dammit!
Back on in 30 seconds people!
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Hi.
Just uh, brought back your videos.
No! No we don't!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Uh, what was that?
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
Oh my god!
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?
Noo.
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
I didn't know that.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
The one with "Heston" on it.
Interesting.
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
Ohh whoops.
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
You can say that again Mac.
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
But what?
She keeps punching me.
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Is that some kind of boat talk?
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
Hey guys!
Hey, all right!
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Please. This is so your fault.
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Ow!
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
What are you gonna do?
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Joey!
Oh man!
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
What's going on?
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Yeah that's better than my way.
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
I... I don't know what you are talking about.
I've had better.
Okay! When?!
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
4:30.
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
Yes. Vividly.
She was kidding about that right?
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.
It can do this.
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Oh!
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
That can be arranged.
Let's reset.
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
Hey, Kate!
Morning.
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Really? Male nurses?
Yeah, I was bummed too.
Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
Oh Hans.
Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
I'll never forget you Hans.
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
Chandler.
Awww, man! Really?
That's a good point.
Yeah.
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
Come here, check this out!
What? Is it the comet?
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Y'know, there's two women dude.
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Oh, yeah, right.
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
She is gonna hate me.
Yeah, well...
That's patio furniture!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Probably kill myself!
..Excuse me?
Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
What?!
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
Well have we finished the scene?
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
He is so amazing.
Oh, I know. Look at him.
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
He doesn't do much, does he?
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
Well where... Where did she go?
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Nooo.
Oh. What do you do?
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one.
Uh-huh.
So uh, which one is mine?
Ohh yes.
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Yeah, it's mine.
I bet it's fast.
Yeah!
It's got 'em!
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Wh-what?
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
Destiny.
Sure.
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Sure! Why?
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Okay, here we go...
There. Now there is.
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Man's got a point.
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
You did!
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
Okay.
What are you doing?
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
So, we gettin' a fish?
You had sex with her didn't you?
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Page 42, page 42, page 42.
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
At least I care about his feelings!
What?!
And why wouldn't he get it?
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
You have pets!
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Really?
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
What?!
The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
I'm starving!
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Please! I made this game what it is.
Not fun anymore?
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
No! No we don't!
I... I don't know what you are talking about.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
Hey, thanks for talking to me.
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
What?
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
It's all London, baby! Here we go.
You got your passport?
Ohh!!
There it is.
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
Yeah.
Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
Well, I feel like a snack!
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Oh.... my God.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
I mean, this is unbelievable.
I know. This is really, really huge.
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Dude-dude-dude!
What?!
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
So what job did you get Joe?
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Here you go.
Oh.
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Pardon?
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Well, these really are the days of our lives.
What?!
Oh God!
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
You got a callback too didn't you?
Yeah I did!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
I don't know! But it's the same!
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Full house.
You got me.
: I thought we had them!
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Because we won our apartment back!
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Yeah, so.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
I didn't know that.
I never knew that either.
Hey guys! What's up?
Heyyy.
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Alright, so what's it about?
Well I like both eggs equally.
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
Gunther, kiss me.
What?
Can I sleep on your couch?
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Say it!
Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
No.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Uh yeah, right here.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
I'm intrigued.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
We did it!!
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
Oh well, okay, good luck.
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
Oh. Oh.
Joey...
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
Yes!!
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Nope, not that one.
Can you go any faster with that?
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Aw, I know all about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Aw, don't do that
We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Hey.
Hey! How'd the audition go?
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
Yeah, did I fool ya?
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Okay.
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
All right!
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
What?
I love you.
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
Hey!
Hey! What's up?
Oh thanks!
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
You do know that Wham broke up?
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Where is Emily?
Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
What's in the bag?
Um, just some presents.
OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
Cute.
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Oh great!
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Okay, I'll stop.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
You wanna play?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
I thought you could use the help.
Coffee in a fight!
Sure! Why?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Ooh!
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
Howdy.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
Oh, just do it!!
Op, op, I'm convinced!
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
All right!
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Yeah!
I know. They were mine.
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
Well, there you go.
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Hey.
Hey.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
I told ya.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Yeah, me either.
Maybe I could do it.
That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Hey!
Hey!
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
It's 4:30.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
You mean with Casey.
Or Casey.
No-no, Kathy.
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
Yeah!
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Why?
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Oh, no.
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
No he didn't.
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
You really didn't have to. Wow.
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
On your dresser.
Okay that is the one we already have!
What?
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
Oooh.
With mealworms.
Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Oh, well I'm uh...
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
13.
Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
What?
My identical hand twin!
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
Done.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Oh, well great.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
Uhhhh.
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
Three, Two, One!
Cut!
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Absolutely!
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
We'll talk later.
Yeah. Thank you.
Shut up, and put my table back.
Okayyy!
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
In the moment, yeah.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Hey, hey, they're runnin'
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Get out.
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
Hey.
Hey.
I had one.
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
You don't have any secrets!
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Ugh.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
This is ridiculous.
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
Oh for cryin' out loud!
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
It's my joke.
It's my joke.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Let's go watch it at your place.
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Oh no-no-no-no!
We don't know what could make this go away.
And no one touches the air around the TV!
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Well, it does.
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
No you're not.
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
Hello? Hi.
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
Taste it.
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing.
Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Oh, no!
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
H-h-h-how's the duck?
He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
No, that's all right.
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Hi.
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
Your what?
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
You're welcome.
Woof, woof.
Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
Who?
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Ross, I...
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Because I lose her stuff!
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Rach? What are you doing?
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
Ahh, to be 13 again.
Yeah.
You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I won't leave you!
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Maybe that's the problem.
What?!
Is that some kind of boat talk?
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Hey!
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
How does it happen?
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
What's fish hooking?
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Oh no!
You slept with my sister?
This is not good for my rage.
Monica, is this true?
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
You sick bastards!
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Hey sweetie!
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
Come on!
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Professor Geller?
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Oh great!
Oh, okay.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Huh. A moo-point?
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
I had a wedding.
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
Isn't Ben in this?
Oh, yeah!
No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Listen, um...
I'm sorry.
I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Thank you.
We were playing poker, alright...
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
And then he did.
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
Hi!
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
You think?
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
Yeah.
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Hey!
There he is!
No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
Ohh great!! Hello.
Joey, it's Phoebe. Did you stop Rachel?
So nothing got ruined?
No.
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Why would they think they're invited?
You got me. I don't...
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
You take your time.
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
And your friend Phoebe?
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
All right!
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
No. I've learned my lesson.
Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
I get to hire my own assistant!
Ahhh!!
And you were at this job for four years?
That's right.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
Okay, see ya later.
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
He just said, "No strippers."
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
No, Janice.
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
They don't?
How does it happen?
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Wow, how many have you got?
Fifty-six!
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
How come we have one extra place setting?
No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
Come on man, you're not a potato.
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
Is that what I want?
Yes.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
I know!
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Are you okay?
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
And did you notice...?
Yeah.
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
...What shoe?
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
I put it on to scare Chandler!
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
Hey!
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Hello to the rest.
Hi!
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
What happened?
Joey, why would you do that?
Because they wanted me to audition!
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Oh.
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
You guys live around here too?
You know it?
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
Thank God! I'm exhausted!
So you guys want coffees?
Yeah, me too.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Nice!
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Yeah.
A-ha!
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Great, you can cover Chandler.
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
You know what the. . .
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
No, no!
What are you crazy?!
Allll done!
Aww, thank you.
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
Really?
Yeah, for you!
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Hey!
You did it! You got ordained?!
Our minister...
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
That's great Joe!
Uh-huh.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
You are so beautiful.
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
Oh my God!
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Oh-oh.
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Don't touch him!
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Thanks for telling me!
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Okay, break-up's still on!
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Hi guys!
Hey!
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Wow, how many have you got?
Fifty-six!
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
Hey Rach?
Yeah?
Oh my God! Joey!
What is the matter with you?
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Yeah.
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
Alright, could I just ask you one question?
Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
You meant sex, right?
Do you have a sec?
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
What, what's that?
Open it, open in.
Oh my God.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
I've been back and forth.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!

There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Yes!
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Yeah! No?
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
Hiya!
Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
Scene 5, take 1.
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits.
Are you seein her again tonight?
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
Who?
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
What do ya say? What do ya say?
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
Well ah, what can you swing?
You don't have, anything?
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
For three years?
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Yeah, me too.
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
How sad are we?
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
I just asked that girl out.
Nice!
Yes it is. See.
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
There are?
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
She was kidding about that right?
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Dude, I don't know.
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
So that story doesn't make you cry?
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
What's this?
Aww, thanks man.
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
What did you get her?
A pen.
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Why not?
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Yep!
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Your tax dollars?
Yeah, okay.
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
It could've been a hair straightener.
Oh.
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Thanks Monica!
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
Really? You'll do anything?
Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
What about the birds?
You pick one.
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
Eddie.
Morning.
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
"Heating device."
Radiator.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Good one.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
Like-like what?
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
It is???
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
That was my dad!
Oh my God!
Oh, did you catch him?!
Uh-huh.
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together.
But what does that gonna do...
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
Ohh.
Really?! How come?
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
I hate you!!
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Monica, Monica is great.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Yeah, isn't he?
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.
Hey.
Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
What's this?
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
I can't believe he didn't come!
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Yeah.
We just want you to think it through.
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Great.
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
Hey, what's up?
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Two?
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
Nooo, four.
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Oh!
Ow!
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
And an assistant.
Sophie, get in here!
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Who are you going out with?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
What is this? Fruit?
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Yeah, I understand.
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
Well that too. Joey?
Yeah?
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
Well, uh.
Really?
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Knick fan?
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
What's he doin' in my section?
I guess he doesn't know.
Mornin'.
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
Oh, hi!
Hey.
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
Oh my God! What happened?
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Die Hard 2.
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Joey, we just saw it!
And?
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
And your friend Phoebe?
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
All right, I'm sorry.
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Yes that was mine.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
Hey!
Hey!
Huh. All right.
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Over a month.
Sure, I'd like that.
So uh, what's your name?
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
Hello?
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
I don't want to hear about her!!
Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
Kate, do you even like me?
Of course I do.
I don't know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy... Why can't I just pick someone like you?
Thanks.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
I-kea! This is comfortable.
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
Okay.
And for you sir?
It's uh, it's already been roasted.
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
I'm doing my scenes with you?
Nice to meet you Joey.
No I didn't.
I think you did.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
No kidding.
Where do you work?
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
She keeps punching me.
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Nice!
Well, you certainly own that room.
Hi.
Hey!
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Wow!
Really! You got a place upstate?
Sure!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Yeah!
Yeah!
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
Oh my God!
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
The silk? Feels really good!
Huh.
That's great Joe!
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Wh-what?! Why?!
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
I like it.
Are you kidding?
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Get out.
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
That's what they'll call us.
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
Hey!
Hey.
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Weird world. Your kids?
I figure my character has kids.
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Uh-huh!
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Why not?!
What is the thing?
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
What?!
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Hey, Pheebs.
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Right...
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
You spit on me man!
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Where?
At his apartment. Is this juice?
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
...He's in.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
All right.
Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Yes it's true.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
My God Monica!!
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Hey, here she comes.
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
The game is over, we eat now?
No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
My lighter's in there!
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
I had to go with the odds Rach.
The commercial?
No!
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Yes that was a nice place!
Yeah!
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Yeah!
You're building a post office?
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Hey Estelle, listen...
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
Really?!
Yeah!
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Which guy?
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
Okay! How you doin'?
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
You're not going to believe this!
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Again?
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Why not?
Because I lose her stuff!
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
...He's in.
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
Would you look at them?
Yeah, can't help but.
I miss Rose.
Oh, yeah?
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Thanks!
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
I guess.
Thank you.
Hey!
Hey!
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
Joey, do you have a minute?
Dude, what am I gonna...
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
I, um, can't tell you.
Joey, what's going on?
About what?
He's planning your birthday party.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
No I don't think so.
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
Oh, excuse me.
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Two?
Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Yes! Whew!
We have to assign heads to something.
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Hey.
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
So the going for help went well?
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Then why are you smoking?
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Maybe you should.
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Oh, that is so not true.
Oh, it is.
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Nothing!
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Well, it involved Monica.
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Joey, you have got to take this back!
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
You wanna smell him?
I assume we're talking about the baby now.
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Hey.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
An egg?
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Cache? Jaunty?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
I'll be right back. What was that?
What?
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Ohh. Like what?
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
Open the box!!
What?!
So?
Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
What are you doing?
Ohh, sorry.
Ohh whoops.
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
No, it was just the three of us.
Huh!
You know what?
What?
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
It's ridiculous!
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Who are they killing off?
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
Yeah.
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Did I say you could smell it?!
I can't smell your sandwich?
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
And tell him what?
Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
I have actually not heard of that.
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Yes!!
Ohh!
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Oh. Aw, forget it.
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
That's very nice.
That's sweet, Joey.
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
No, I'm alright man. Really.
No, I'm picking you up.
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
OK, I'll see you later babe.
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
What?
This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
I have.
What's that smell?
I know!
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
What?!
No, no!
What are you crazy?!
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
I am dressed.
I have an oily T-zone!
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Hey!
Do we pay for this?
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
"Benefits lapsed."
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Let me see that!
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Yeah.
Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
You.
You?
No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
Plastic spoons. Great.
Lick away my man.
What?
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
What the hell is that?!!
It's a, it's a cat!
Yes it is!
Why is it inside out?!
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
My folks.
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
What?!
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Hey!
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Oh yeah? That's great!
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Hi.
Hey!
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Hey.
So uhh, how's the palace?
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
I hope she throws up on you.
So...
Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
Wow! That is a bad audition.
How-how did you lose your job here?
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Do you still work here?
Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Great!
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
I don't think mine likes me either.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
Yeah let's head off to work.
We should go.
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
What-what are you talking about?!
Yeah. So?
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
Sweety, what are you talking about?
Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
Monica!
Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
No!
What?
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
Phoebs.
Wow.
Joey!
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Well, what is the truth?
Yeah, what's going on?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
I'm sorry, do I know you?
What are you doing?
Oh! You got it?!
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
Hey there Ross!
Hey!
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Yeah?
Why-why would I care about that?
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
I look more like him than you do!
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
I don't think so.
Wow!
Yeah.
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
Thanks! Let's keep going.
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
"Smoke away."
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
"...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
No! Why?
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
Hey.
Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
Ahh.
OK, ready when you are.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Heh, what d'ya say?
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
You're kidding.
Wow!
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
If anything should happen to him...
Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
He will, Joe.
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Monkey lover!
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
I've got a science question.
Hmm?
Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Services? Oh, services.
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
Any time you're ready, Joey.
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
Hey I-
Hey what?
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
Excellent!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
Estelle said I didn't get it.
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
What kind of problem?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Okay sure!
Really?!
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
You can be the best man when I get married.
I'll never get to be a best man!
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
They break your heart, don't they?
Y'know, I don't really their permission.
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Oh! Pathetic!
Where?
Our place, the hall! I...
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
It could be like a big giant guy.
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
No.
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
Why not?!
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
This is your place?
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
Hi!
Hey!
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Oh that's great!
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
What?
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
So did you break up with Joanna?
I think so.
The volcano?
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Chandler-
You gotta let me slam the door!
Joey-
Ah! Huh?
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
I couldn't do it.
Good for you, Joey.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
Well umm...
The baby shower for Phoebe!
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
She was?
Well, she graduated from high school!
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
Phoebe, wait a minute!
I'm an assistant buyer!!
Yeah, all right.
Okay.
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
No, that's all right.
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
Hey.
Hey! How was sailing?
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Women are mean!!!
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Excuse me?
What?
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
You have a roommate?!
Yes, Denise. Denise!
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Well, you're gonna.
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Okay.
Yeah!
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
Nice!
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
You do?
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
Joey, do you work here?
No.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
You are really frightening me.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
What?
Well, what is it?
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
Hoyt?
Really, is he a swimmer?
He's got the body for it.
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
Oh my God!
What is that?
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Hey Pheebs!
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
Come on, two on one.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
He went out with my wife!
Joey!
That's my wife!!! Get out!
Well, we should go.
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
You guys wanna eat here?
Yeah! As long as we're here!
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
I know. My arm is killing me.
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
How does going to a strip club help him better?
Because there are naked ladies there.
There are naked ladies there too.
Yeah.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
What?!
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
Hey!
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Oh, I can't go.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Uh-hmm.
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Judge rules, no violation.
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
Ooh, that bad, huh?
What?
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
What?!
I've been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? Where have you been? Vic?!
What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
When is she leaving?
Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Wait a minute.
What?
Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
You're driving me crazy with that!
Okay, I'll stop.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
You wanna play?
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Alright, alright, alright...
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Wow. He's strict.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
What gay thing?
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Hi.
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
I can't help it!
Borrow money from me?
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I am sorry, Chandler.
I am sorry, Ross.
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
Condoms?
And condoms are the way to do that?
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Take it back?
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Oh, we could do this all day.
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
You hug me!
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
Yeah.
Get out.
No.
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
So I'm gonna take off then!
What's so funny?
Oh.
What-what's so funny?
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
I was always Joanne.
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Booo!!
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
Let's go watch it at your place.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Yeah, I've been around.
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
Why?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
I can.
Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
Yeah!
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
That was good beer.
Ohh...
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Later!
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Saw what?
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
Hi!
Hi! What are you doing here?
Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
Hi!
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
Uhh, rub it?
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
Time's up, now your dead.
And deaf!
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Do we pay for this?
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
That is lucky.
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
Oh, you weren't finished?
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
It's the same story.
Wow, it's really long.
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
Well, first it's not a purse.
Okay, anytime.
Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
What?!
All right, I'm gonna go!
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
There was nudity!
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
Hey! Any good mail?
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
"Benefits lapsed."
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Great! Roomie!
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
They don't look any bigger than me!
I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
All right.
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Can I help you?
He's not here right now.
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
Can't we just use a pen?
No, Amish boy.
I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
You could say that.
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
You and Rachel.
What? Why not?
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
Come on, lady!
Please, please take him too.
Hello! One marriage please!
Yep, we wanna get married!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
Oh, So you can move them!
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Hi.
Hi!
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
I am.
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
It's not that far! Just drop!
Do not rush me!!
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
That really was some of your best work.
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
Drum roll.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
You're actually going through with this?
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Rough numbers?
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Uh, if you say so sir.
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
After what I did? Can you blame her?
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Now calm down Joey.
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
I'm still on the set!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
How?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
What is this? Fruit?
Monica's making jam.
Because the kids need new shoes.
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Yeah. Right.
Okay.
Ross isn't here.
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
What is the matter with you?!
No! Barry and Mindy.
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
Way to be cool, man.
What's he talking about?
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
Yeah!
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
Hey.
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
That's not Ross!
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
So what do you want me to do?
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Okay, done.
What's 'pleh'?
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
I Gotcha!!
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
Yeah, sure.
No, not you.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
You were amazing out there.
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
I can't take any...
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
Oh my God, you're back!
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
What's a Movement class?
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Oh, my baby!
Cut!
Oh, just years of experience.
Can I get some ice here?!
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
I say push her down the stairs.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Forget about her.
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Oh my God.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Yeah. No. No...
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
You're kidding.
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Oh, that's true.
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Ennnh.
I've got canned goods.
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
Come on! Do something!
I am, I'm ignoring you.
Oh, what the hell is that?
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
I-I wasn't in that.
I know.
Hi!
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
Wow, he looks so normal.
He's even kind of cute.
Funniest? Heckles?
That's what it says.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
M-Me again?
Sure! Why not?
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
You know the words! You are so into this!
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
So what are you gonna be?
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
Sure. What?
Well, first it's not a purse.
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
Oh no, wait! Joey!
73! 72! 71!
What?
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Raymond Chandler.
Someone you didn't make up!
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
For just you?
Yeah.
No I-I-I'm fine.
All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
Well at least we know she's a woman.
I can't believe she's married.
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
They're all tourists.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Good choice.
Thanks.
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
Hey!
Hey!
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
We have a half hour.
No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
Okay.
Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
You know the hotels?
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Well, I-I could live without it.
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Oh, "you do, do you"?
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
I call Monica's room!
You can't just call Monica's room.
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
What?
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
You are now.
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Oh man.
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Well thanks!
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
Ehh.
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Oh that's great!
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
What?
What did Joey say? I like you back?
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
It came up.
So I nodded off a little.
Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
Naked friends.
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Joey... Switzerland?
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
Toootal chick-flick.
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
There was nudity!
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Karen.
I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
Yep. Ice Capades.
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
What?!! What?
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.
Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
Do you have my credit card?
Thank God!
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
What?
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
I don't think so.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
Hey!
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
So, rocks.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
This took you all day?!
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
Hey!
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Get away from me I said no!
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Joey that is horriable.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
We do not have one of those signs.
Two girls and a boy?
Yeah!
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
You're on!
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Yes.
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Take off your shirt!
Oh my!!
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
It's-it's-it's almost dead!
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
I think so.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
You serious?!
That's great!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
What? Ow!
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Yes! Did you see that?
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Oh my God!!
That's where you pick up the bag.
Exactly.
Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
What?
I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
Ohhhh man
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Why don't you try to do-

To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
Well where... Where did she go?
I can't believe I ruined this.
I am so sorry man.
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Hey!
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
Monica! Would it?
She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Thanks.
Enough!
Lean-lean-lean!
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
You know it?
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Yeah.
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
That's not true!
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
Go!!
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Forget about her.
Course there, they just call it food.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
What is the matter with you?
Ugh!
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
What?
Cupping.
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
I said name one!
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
What?
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
No!
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
The volcano?
What?!
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Probably just the first half.
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Yeah.
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
It's him, not it!
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
When did I try to give you money?
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
The Celtics.
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Oh, me too!
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Well, we certainly are alone.
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Oh my God, what's goin' on?
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
I like her so much!
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Really?
No freakshow, she's fictional.
Thank you.
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
I don't even know how I would go about it.
Oh, please!
Hey, how you doin'?
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Thank you.
But are you sure you can do this?
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Hiya!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Yeah, I've been around.
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Great! Problem solved!
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Huh?!
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Could we be more white trash?
How desperate am I?
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Hello everybody!
Hi!
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
What?
Okay.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
All right, you have yourself a deal.
Okay. See?! I told ya!
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
What happened?
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
This body?
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
I don't want to, I'm scared.
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Who are you talking too?
Why?! What happened?!
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
What-what is it, what is it?
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
I think so.
I can do that for the kids.
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Okay. Have a benefit.
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Is there something wrong?
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Well, only if you order stuff.
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
She's a woman!
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
... And where's this money coming from?
What kind of research?
Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Ross! They're gonna kill you!
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
No!
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Yes have you seen any?
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Of course.
Oh. Then, no.
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
What award are you practicing for?
Grammy, Best New Artist.
Ohh that's great!
Yeah!
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Things change, roll with em.
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
I'm sorry. See ya.
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
I can't believe this Chandler!
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Oh, well I'm uh...
Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. .
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Yeah.
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Okay.
Oh God!
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
What's going on?
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
Sure, now I'm scared.
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
With a man?
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Five.
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Pheebs!
Hey!
Yeah!
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
Fine with me!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
No it is not!
What are you talking...
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
A woman in a man's body.
Much better.
Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
Yeah, little Eric.
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
No.
Well, here it is.
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
It's not on my head.
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
I'm wearing two belts.
Are you drunk?
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
Look I want you, now.
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Joey, no means no!
Hey!
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
No.
Yes.
Thanks man.
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Uh, what was that?
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
Well, I guess that's it.
Why, what happened?
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
Who was that?
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Seven hundred bucks!
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
Ok.

Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
Could've been a peach.
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Really?
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Oh. Right.
Hell no, we'll pay!
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
"You have two new messages."
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
No! I'm putting that in my room.
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Five years.
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
Aw, I love that.
You guys!
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
3, 2,
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
Well, you just...
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
You guys! You guys!
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Oh God, no.
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
He's talking to London!
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Well, can you dance at all?
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Well try to keep it down.
Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really...
Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
And say nothing?
Uh-huh, yeah that's right.
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
What? You mean behind my back?
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
We were just talking about you.
Really?!
Right in there!
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
That is true.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Congratulations!
Oh that's great!
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
So uhh, you ready?
Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that?
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
What, you don't think I know that?
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
That was you!
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
No! Joey!
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
An egg?
I think it's winning.
I think it's insane.
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Uhh, the ball thing.
Yeah?
Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Okay!
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
Hey! What's going on?
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
You have been maid of honor before?!!
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
Okay.
Joey Tribbiani, this is...
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
How do you do there, Wayne?
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Wow! Sure! That's great!
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
So...What?
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Really? Right across the street?
Yeah!
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Yeah I did!
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
You got porn!
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
Thanks.
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
Where is she?
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Thank you.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
Hm-mm, corn beef.
Okay.
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
COME ON!!!!
Y'know what? We need to move on.
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Uh-oh, busted!
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
Is that what I want?
Yes.
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Lemonade? You ok man?
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
I fell down an elevator shaft.
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
And of course, crotchless panties.
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Six months.
Not if I get there first.
Ohhh, man!!
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
We did?
Yeah, right.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Say what?
I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
Oh that was a real person?!
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
Yeah, I understand.
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
What is this? What's going on?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
What-what are you talking about?!
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Yeah, they're not coming.
What?!
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
In this life, Phoebe.
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
That's a good point.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
What's up man?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Alright, somebody.
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Hey!
Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
Really?
Oww!
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Yay!
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
It's creamier.
Yeah, well, is that better?
My God! What happened to you?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
I'm...happy...for you?
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Yeah, we are so sorry.
You're kinda stepping on the song.
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
Joey was in a porno movie.
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Alright. Cab driver number two?
You're welcome.
Things change, roll with em.
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
Oooh.
Yeah, Ginger something.
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
No! No-no-no...
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Rach, these are for you.
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Picture? What picture?
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
Oh, thanks.
But you're spittin' all over me man!
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
Man, this is...
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
Oh, he sees her!
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
But it's $2,000.
Sorry.
We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Oh-I don't know.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
Hey.
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
What were you modeling for?
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
That's patio furniture!
What about the birds?
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
Come on.
That was pretty intense huh?
I hope he did!
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Hey!
Hey!
You let Joey drive it?!
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
The wedding starts at six.
You'll vamp?!
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Ah, finally an explanation.
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
Wow!
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Oooo-ooh!
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
This is not good for my rage.
Monica, is this true?
Yes it's true.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
These little women. Wow!
Your liking it, huh?
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
Please!!
No, not getting my bra!
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Okay.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
I highly doubt that.
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Who the hell are you?!
I'm Joey! How are you doin'?!
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Who the hell is Carl?!
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
No!
So what happened?
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
Yeah, totally!
Feel better now?
Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
I am so sorry.
I know that too.
Hey!
Hi.
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
No I-I-I'm fine.
All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
And that's how you bought it?
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call.
Oh.
Or... Dick.
Hey.
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
Well that's not true.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
You do?
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
Well then maybe I will.
Fine with me.
Who's drink can I freshen?
Almost time for cake.
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
What kinda stuff?
You cook naked?
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Yeah. So?
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Well, may I ask for one example?
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
Who was that?
Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
Whoa, she's pretty.
I'm sorry, what?
What?
Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!
What's the part?
Come on! That's great.
Wow!
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Oh yeah!
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
All right.
All right.
Hey man.
What is up?
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
You?
Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
Well, my goodness, what was that?
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
No-no-no-no-no we came together!
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
Really, y'think so? I don't..
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!
So?
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
Yeah?
How you doin'?
I can't help it!
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Really?
No.
Noooo!!
Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Halftime.
Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Oh no! An asteroid!
Um-mm.
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
Did I not just tell him?
Yes, you did.
It's not all juice!
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
You guys.
Oh, God.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
So, you'd hire me, right?
For what?
Huh? What?
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
Ooh!
Okay!
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
It's not my first time.
I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Why are they here?
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
Yeah!
I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Pop it in.
Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
What's wrong with people having sex?
Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
Hey!
But those are the words! Those exact words!
Hey!
Hey!
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Hi!
Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Oooo-ooh!
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Jeez, what a baby.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Well there you go.
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay, these things happen.
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Bye!
Bye!
Dude! How come you took off?
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Huh.
What?
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
Hmmm, that's very cool.
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
Yeah, that was real.
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Quick volleyball question.
Volleyball.
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Dennis.
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Yeah! She's right in there!
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
I'm gettin' my chair back!
What? Wh-hey!
Joey you broke my chair!!
Your chair?!
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
How do you not fall down more?
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
Lovely, just lovely.
Really? Thanks.
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
I know.
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Me and Chandler?!
Uh-hmm.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Hey, what time is it?
2:17.
Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Yeah! You wanna come?
Yeah!
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
A pharmacist.
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
I was tired!
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
It was.
Those were like the best seats ever.
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
Oh. Oh, God!
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
Great. Great.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Why would you think that?
Everybody has to audition.
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
So, uh, how often can you do it?
As much as he needs.
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
Yeah, I forget which ones.
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Hey, you guys...
Hey!
Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Oh no! An asteroid!
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Yeah?
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Hey.
Hey.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
Cool.
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Waaa-aaah.
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
Joey, I really don't...
Can you tell me how this happened?
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
Hey Terry!
Good to see you again!
It's a different building.
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Ok, this could be tough.
Ooh, you almost had it.
No no, you're fine, you're fine.
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Hello!
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
I know.
What's up Joe?
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
No thank you.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
Congratulations!
Uh-huh.
So uh, which one is mine?
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Why?
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
So you're really okay with this?
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
You want some help.
No help required Chico.
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
What?
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
I don't know!
Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
No they didn't!
Hey!
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Thank you.
Of course.
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Really?! Well, when?
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
What's a Movement class?
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
I like it!
Eh? We'll show him!
Hi. I'm back.
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
What?
What?
Oh my god!
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
I'll try.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
I don't know, clean places?
Umm, yum!
Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
Okay, good luck!
Hey!
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
Wait a second, I could star in it!
Or that.
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
What is the thing?
What?
They were in his office.
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
Oh!
Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
They don't look any bigger than me!
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
I think it was valued at 19,000
Joey! Joey, good one!
That's good. Very good!
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Okay.
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
What?!
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Well you don't.
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Pheebs, I was wondering...
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
No!
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
What are you guys gonna do?
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
Yeah, well, it feels different.
It's dry.
No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Everybody has to audition.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Oh, ok.
Is she gonna be all right?
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Oh.. oh... oh.
Well, this has been fun.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
No, I just think Monica was that fat.
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
I am pretending.
Well then, do it better!
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
I don't need that anymore.
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Okay.
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
I know...
Really?
Pheebs?
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
Dude, they're not objects.
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
We know!
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
Oh, yeah.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
What do ya say? What do ya say?
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Nothing, why?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Stop it!
Please stop it!
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Hey, dude!
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Sorry.
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Hello!
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
Wh-what?!
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Why not?!
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
There is no father.
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
Joey...
What's the part, Anti-man?
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
Hey!
Hey!
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
What?
Y'know, all the women.
I'm right here!
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
How?
Again I must go back to, how?
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
No you won't.
No we won't.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Go!!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Yes. Yes!
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Hey!
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Well, I'd have to say gay.
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
I-I-I don't know.
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Umm, no thank you.
What's with her?
Okay.
What do you like better action or comedy?
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Are you serious?!
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
What is DOOL?
Oh!!
That's great!
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
Yeah.
Nice shades.
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
Yeah?
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
I know!
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
You're right.
Yeah!
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
You won't boss me around anymore?
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Yeah.
Well, now we got a reason.
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
That makes more sense.
So, what's going on now?
Whaddya see?
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
We'll see.
Well, thank you for lunch.
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
Oh.
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Thanks!
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Well, you're amazing.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Don't do it.
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
Nice to meet ya.
At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo.
Wow.
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
Yes! Well that-yes.
Why else would we be here?
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Thanks, man, big help.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Joey!!
The green dress? Really?
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Please be kidding.
OK. I'm in my apartment...
....yeah... what else?
Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
I do NOT want this unit!!
Fine!
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
How did you? How? How?
Hey!
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
There's an ad for a naked chef?
Hi.
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
Rings?
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
I love you. And I know about the baby.
What baby?
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Maybe, because you told him not to.
What are you the memory woman?
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
What?!
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Noooo.
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
We could climb Mt. Everest!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
Yeah!
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
What?
All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
What, you don't think I know that?
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
What?
He's gonna eat the cake!
Oh yeah.
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Ohh-oh, chilling!
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Really?
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Whoa, she's pretty.
I'm sorry, what?
What?
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
Really?
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
That's okay, Joe.
All right, let's go Pheebs.
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
No! I'm up for a Soapie!
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
What are you talking about?
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
Take 36 is up!
All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?
Uh sure.
Okay.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Whoa!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Wow!
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
That makes more sense.
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
BEND OVER?!!!
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
Oh my God!
There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
What's the matter?
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
You don't like puppies?
Okay, you are new!
You don't like ice cream?
It's too cold.
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Yes that would be lovely.
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
We're sorry honey.
Oh, it's okay.
And heels.
Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Well, there you go.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Look, what do you want me to say?
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Oh man!!
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
They're not a couple!
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Oh yeah!
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
Ha!
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Tequila!!
That's fun.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
You're building a post office?
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
Ok, this could be tough.
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Need a new table.
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
There are?
Yeah! Richard!
That's right.
Chandler loves marriage!!
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
How you doin there squirmy?
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
I have nothing to do with casting.
So what're you guys gonna eat?
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
Yeah, of course, Donald.
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Chandler!
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
I see where you're goin'!
What's up with the greed Joe?
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Well, the duck...
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Y'know-y'know what I really want?
What?
Any progress?
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
They don't have those.
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
Ohhh, yeah!
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
What are you talking about?
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Okay!
All right!
Hey!
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Yeah?
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
So... and?
Allright!
Alright... I've got to go shower.
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Yeah.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
Hi!
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Ooooh, nice.
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
That is sooo not true!
What?
I can check that for ya.
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Whoa!
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Since when?
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
Hi!
Hey!
I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
No!
There you go. Thank you!
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
Hey you guys.
Hey Joe what's up?
I can see why that's hard to resist.
I like her so much!
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Hey, it's Janice.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
Y'know I think you can take her.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
Christmas cookie?
Looks good. I'll take it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
You're right, you're right, it is.
Yes.
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
I can't believe she cracked your code!
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Eh. Beth dies.
Beth, Beth dies?
Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
So did you ask him?
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
Hey.
Hi.
About what?
Y'know, about what happened with us.
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
Where do I know you from?
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
Tribbiani.
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
She's not much of a phone person.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Alright...
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
What?
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Yeah!
Are you guys sure about this?
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Let me see. Oh, right.
When did you go to a sperm bank?
And that's how you bought it?
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
Why? What happened now?
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
Damnit!! Did you move?!
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
So what are you gonna be?
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Hey.
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
Well there you go.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Okay.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
All right, then show me some manly moves.
All right.
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
Sorry Phoebs.
Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Maybe he's. . . gay.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
You know what makes the itching even worse?
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
What?!
What?!
This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
Yes!
All right.
It's 6:00.
Yeah, well...
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
Not on you! On the stripper!
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
Yeah, okay.
What trail?
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
Blah?!
Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
I guess.
Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Okay. I am so hot!
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
The only problem!
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Uh-huh.
Okay...
Give me $400!
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Right.
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
I'm right here!
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
I'm still right here!
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
What are you guys woofing about?
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
You want my advice?
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
Yeah, right!
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
Hey Mon!
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
You're not on TV.
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Oh my God!
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Come on Joey!!!
I can't believe you would say that!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Thanks.
You got waaaay too much free time.
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Oh, hey!
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
I'm out.
He painted that.
Let's see, ahhh... Where does the Pope live?
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Who the hell is Carl?!
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
You're kidding.
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
Well then let me do it!
Joe...
Joey look it's really sweet...
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Please stop it!
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
God! What are you, in second grade?
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
What?
We're just friends.
What four of us?
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
What?
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Well, you just...
What?!
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Does anybody need anything?
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
Well, it is overdue.
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Well I just thought...
It's a curling iron.
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Wow! Sure! That's great!
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
They'll never understand!
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
Oh my God!!
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Sure. So how long you been...
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
I'm having surgery!
What?!
What kind of surgery?!
Transplant.
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
Isn't that a line from the show?!
That's a line from the show too!
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Hi, how are ya?
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
No, no, this is the first time.
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
Well, let me see.
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
No! Why?
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
Why don't you open with a joke?
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
H-He's in China!
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
What kinda change?
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
Mornin'.
Your territory, huh?
Yeah. Bijan for men?
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Ohh, that's a good one.
Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
My mom will.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
You can tell us.
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Ok.
I hear ya.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
With Carol? Oh.
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Uh-huh.
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
I don't know, I don't know.
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
Oh that's too bad.
Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.
'Kay!
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
Sorry!
Okay, okay, you got it!
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
What?!
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Ready, Annabelle?
You bet. Maybe some other time?
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
Yeah.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
Hello!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Joey, I saw you push him!
You pushed him!
Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
What?
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
There is not one hair on that head.
Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
Yeah.
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Okay, Chandler, come on!
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
No, Janice.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
So was I.
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Yeah you did.
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Hey! Are you okay?
Fabulous.
Become a drama critic!
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
Well, we could do that!
There's other stuff too.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
Huh?!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
I've got cold feet.
...it's gonna be okay!
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
Yeah?
Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Ok.
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Why?
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
I'll be there.
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
Let's get out of here.
The one time they're not home.
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
She's comin'.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
It looks like a women's purse.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
Exactly! Unisex!
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Then you do. Heh, heh.
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
What a pity stay?
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
Joey that is so sweet.
Hey.
I couldn't do it.
You couldn't do it?!
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Hey!
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
I don't want to do that.
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
What am I doing?
Well, it is overdue.
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
The fear?
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Your what?
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Well, it does.
Okay, you wore me down.
Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
This is Janice.
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
I'm not breaking up with her!
God, look what I found in the drain.
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
And last but not least.
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Hiiiiii.
Are... are you OK?
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
We are bad people.
Hey, ready for dinner?
Ooh, absolutely!
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
Oh My God.
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Hi everyone.
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
That had to hurt!
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
Come on, tell me.
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Come on, take 'em off!!
All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!
Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
I helped!
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
What, like there's a rule or something?
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
Y'know I think you can take her.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Whadja think?
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Saw your head. Saw your head.
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
He paid a lot of money for it.
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Yeah?
Yeah?
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Interesting.
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Huh. A moo-point?
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Oh.
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Oh.
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
That's a hernia.
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
You're in this picture?
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Good idea! Yes!
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
No. No, Kathy.
Consider Casey.
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Hey!
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Did I squeeze it too hard?
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
Aww...
Big day.
You know he's gay?
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
Thanks!
I know.
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
What code?
What are you guys doing out here?
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
Bastard!
Hey!
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
What?!
I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
No.
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
You're in this picture?
Joey, right?
Yeah.
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Joey, please.
Wow.
Alright, now you say something.
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
This is like the temporary robot, right?
No. Why?
I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
I do not hate Ross!
What picture?
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Yeah! Punch him!!
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
So what. I say, punch him.
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Chandler? A word.
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Yeah?
Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
For Ross.
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Wait a second, I could star in it!
Or that.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
Oh-oh, absolutely!
It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
Oh, yeah!
That commercial always makes me so sad.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
This took you all day?!
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
Hey.
Do you have any ice?
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
Two.
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Oh.
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
How are you feeling?
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
You know, I think I might just.
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
I ran!!
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and...
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
No.
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
I'm sorry.
Joey, onstage!
Where are you Vic?
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
That's what you say about porn.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
What's going on over here?
What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
So...
Absolutely!
I'll see you at 8:00.
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Oh that's great!
Ugh, PBS!
What's wrong with PBS?
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
That's weird.
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Yeah.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
You got married again.
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Oh, my.
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
What?
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Well, what did you do?
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
Can I help you?
Uh-oh.
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
Okay, that hurt us.
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
OH YES!!!!!
Strip Happy Days Game?
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Yeah! Come on.
Awww...
Left.
Damnit!
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
Ohh.
Really?! How come?
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Really? Who-who have you taught?
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
Well, it involved Monica.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
What was the dream about?
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Sure?
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
I can't take any...
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
You don't have any secrets!
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
You want to see her again, right?
Sure.
OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
The show?!
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
Doesn't matter.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
You're all invited to bite me!
He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
That's me.
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
Really.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
You still can't stand her can you?
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Something like that?
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
It's the Knicks!
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
God. I feel violated.
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
No, you should.
Now, don't argue with me...
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
What?
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Ohhh, here it comes.
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
You're jokin' right?
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Oh don't even ask!
Yuck!
That was like 5 years ago.
Yeah you got 5 years left!
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Hey! How you doin'?
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Right! And when is that due?
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
What is it?
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
Hey, kids.
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Oh uh, when?
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Joey... Switzerland?
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
Yes!
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
No, not us... Us!
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
Really? Why?
Hoyt?
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
We'll watch him.
I don't think tho.
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
That'll be $3.85.
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
Amy!
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What?
What? So you never went out with an actress before?
Kate, do you even like me?
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
Hey.
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
So'd you guys have fun?
Your boyfriend is so cool.
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
All right, so we weren't prepared!
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Hey.
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Thanks!
So, you busy Thursday?
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Hey! Hi!
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Well, I'm going to kill you.
Why?
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Oh yeah? That's great!
Aahhuuhhh....
Hey.
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
Yeah!
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
I don't know! Yeah, I do.
Joey!
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Oh no! No! No!
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Oh no, yeah.
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
So uh, what are you guys doing?
Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
We're so sorry.
Yeah.
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
Joey look it's really sweet...
That is true.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
Oh, what the hell is that?
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
I got it! Here we go.
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
What? What?
They tore it down a few days early.
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
Really? To what?
You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
He's got the body for it.
I like that. What?
We do not have one of those signs.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Hey!
Yes that was mine.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
What difference does that make?!
Joey, do you have a minute?
Dude, what am I gonna...
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
No.
Okay. Well, you be careful.
Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
We're so sorry.
Yeah.
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
That sounds great. Same for me.
And for the gentleman?
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Huh.
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
That's still in there?!
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
Man, do you know what guys want!
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Shoot.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
You're so pretty.
Hi!
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Whoa ho.
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Sure.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
What trail?
Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
As crazy as soccer?
You mean you didn't get it from this?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
Sucker!
Hello? Hey Joey!
Sure! Where is it?
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Ahh.
What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
What?
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Let's take it from there.
Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Thank you. Thank you.
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
Yes.
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Not once did we do that.
Hi.
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
The shipment never made it through Omaha?
Hi, you guys.
Hey!
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Well I like both eggs equally.
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
You got waaaay too much free time.
Happy birthday, pal!
We love you, man.
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
Whoa ho.
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
Bye.
Bye.
I am so glad you said cooks.
I know.
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
What?!
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
Hey.
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
A mirror?
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
Yeah, totally!
All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
Amazingly, that makes sense.
You think?
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
Like a goalie, right?
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Huh?
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Oh man!
Unless...
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Again I must go back to, how?
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
Rachel has those in burgendy.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What? Ow!
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Sorry, that was wax.
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Sorry.
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
Oh, that's true.
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Good enough to get fired.
All right, you're hired!
Yes.
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Iced tea.
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
You got me. I don't...
Joey!
Ross's parents are my parents!
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
What?!
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
Uh-oh.
Is there a problem?
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Oh, what did I say?
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Time is money my friend?
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Really? That's great!
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Do you two know each other?
No. No.
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
In 1981 you were 13!
Okay, she can't go.
Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
What?
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
What gay thing?
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
Oh My God.
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Or not.
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
I paid for those tickets!
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
What?
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
We've got a box.
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Ok.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
Oh right, right.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Pheebs?
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Oh yeah, come here.
Oh, that's mature.
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
Joey, you have got to take this back!
No! Joey!
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
I've been back and forth.
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
That's all you're basing this on?
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Oh my God!!
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
They have the best stuff in there.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Why?! What happened?!
I'm so sorry.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Hey, I've been married 3 times
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
Hey, stripper!
What?
The ring is gone!
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
Thanks.
While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Hi!
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
Ok.
Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
Hey pal.
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
The next, next?
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
They loved me!
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
All right.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Uh, boat rope.
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Hmm?
I think it's important that you do.
So what's your name?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
Oh my... God?
So, what're you gonna do?
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Can you believe this place?
I know, this is a great apartment.
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Hey.
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
He's talking to London!
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
I got fired.
Oh!
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
My mom will.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Hey!
Hey.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Why are you doing this?
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Her dancer friends?
Dude, we were good!
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
What? A brain transplant?!
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
When did that happen to you?!
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.
Me too.
Yeah?
Hey!
Sh-shh-shh!
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Oh!
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do. How you doin?
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Joey...
Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
Oh!
Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
Yeah.
Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Ah, we'll all go. Come on.
Thanks you guys! Thank you.
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Why?
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Still broken?
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Nah, not my game.
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Okay!
Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Yep!
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
What a minute, what did he say?
What?! You got us evicted!!
I told you not to go down there!
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Yeah?
What are you saying?
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Hellooo!
Hey.
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
Okay, Phoebe...
Yes! Your honor?
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Oh!
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
You don't think my mom's sexy?
Well... not in the same way...
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Hey.
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
How often do you read it?
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
But that's what...
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
You're so welcome.
Is that supposed to be me?
Yeah.
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
So, there was no miracle?!
No Joe, no miracle.
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
I think I should get the chair!
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Joey that is so sweet.
Hey.
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out.
I hate this game!
OK Joey, your bet.
Ross?
Oh, I am very in.
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
We owe you?!
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Morning. Good morning.
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Whoooaa!
That's my sister.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Pheebs, what about you?
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
Okay .
Here you go.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
I'm in it.
This is terrible, what are you going to do?
That's not good.
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
You wanna play?
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
I'm, I'm okay. See.
Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
They actually said that?
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Oh.
Yeah, no, I understand.
You do, thanks.
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
No. I'm all alone.
Daddy!!
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
MY SANDWICH?!!!
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
My God Monica!!
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
That makes sense!
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Hey, that was really good!
Thanks! Let's keep going.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
No, I just thought it was cute.
Ohh. Like what?
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Yeah it is. . . what?
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
Who's they?
No one.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.
No.
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
You got a Cheeto on your face man.
Hi.
You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Thank you so much.
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Hey.
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Noo! Nothing!
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
So I can do it?
Yeah you can do it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Oh! My hero! What happened?
What a minute, what did he say?
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
Good for you.
So... and?
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Not if you're gonna be like this!
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Uh-huh.
Hmm?
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!

What's wrong?
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Well did you try calling her?
Hey.
Oh!
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
I know. I know.
Feel better?
Yeah, I understand.
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?
Exactly.
No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
No.
Yeah, okay.
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
Joey, why is your cable out?
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
It's not charity, Joe...
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
His dancing partner?!
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Hey.
Hey.
The show?!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Hey, dude!
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
No! No! No!
They're in my bag over there.
Ah.
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
It's uh, right through there.
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Well, what did you do?
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Okay...
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
Put it on.
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
I so am.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
I hate this thing!
Oh, hi Danny.
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Well that's how I feel.
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Shhhh!
What are you shushing?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
I sort've already asked Chandler.
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
Hey Joey.
No, I just thought it was cute.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
...I'm his
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
Oh my God.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
OH.....MY.....GOD!!
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Did not, she did not wink at you....
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Well I just thought...
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
Scene 5, take 1.
And Action!
Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
Okay.
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Love what you've done with the place.
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Oh yeah!
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Yeah, that'd be cool!
Pete's breaking up with me.
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Okay.
Okay.
Not great.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Great, now he's waving back.
What kinda stuff?
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Huh? What?
It's my joke.
It's my joke.
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Well... It's a date.
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
No.
Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
Not a problem.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
She's not much of a phone person.
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Come on. I want to know.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Oh that was a real person?!
I-I-I'm leaving the show?
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Here you go.
Thank you.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
Yeah, you're on your own.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
You guys don't think I look 19?
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
God. I feel violated.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
Oh.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
That's a really long time.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Good luck.
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Ohhhh man
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Monica, leave him alone!
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Do you two know each other?
No. No.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Yeah, thanks.
Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
Joey.
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Oh, I'm sorry what?
So...
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
Oh.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Well, I guess that's something.
Okay.
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Ross! Janice?!
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
So are you actually gonna see her again?
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Yeah right!
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
What you do mean?
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
As crazy as soccer?
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
What?
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
You don't have, anything?
Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
About Ross!
Oh! Oh!
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Ohhhhh!
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
And now for the great news.
What, that wasn't the great news?
Christmas cookie?
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
My god, what happened?
Sure.
So.
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
What the hell happened on that beach?!
It's between us and the sea, Ross!
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Thanks!
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
So Joey, you okay?
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Sorry.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
What?!
My-Oh my God!
I know! They suck!!
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Sorry!
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
She's not even cold yet!
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
Is she gonna be all right?
Nice!
That's great!
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
You stink!
Are you kidding?!
He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
Hey buddy! How's it going?
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
How come you are?!
Because I cared enough to lie!
What are you talking about?
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Where do you work?
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
Hey! Terry.
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
I can't help you Joey.
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Why?
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh, I don't know.
You mean with Casey.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
Y'know, about what happened with us.
Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Nooo.
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
That sounds fair.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
So, what do you thing the good news is?
Oh my.
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
Oh my God!
Wow!
Oh, I love that guy!
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
What about my cab?
I don't need that anymore.
Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
I've never done that.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Really?! You think that will work?
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Fine!
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Eh! There you go.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
No, that was clenching.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, you're on.
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Wow.
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.
Um-hum.
This man is my God.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
You did look like an idiot.
Yeah that's the same.
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Joey, the guy's your best friend.
Oh, who? Me?
Yeah!
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
The only problem!
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Sure! What's up?
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
Do you want me to want you to care?
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Okay. Okay.
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
So what are you guys out doing today?
You done?
Yeah.
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
Wow!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
Oh no, you'll have to come.
Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
And tell him what?
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Great. Great.
I'll be there.
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Hi!
Hi!
Great!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
You're not his godfather.
What?! Are you kidding?!
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Oh Joey!
No she hasn't.
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Hey, where you been?
Score.
She is so hot!
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Great! Roomie!
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Now calm down Joey.
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Not broad backed!
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
So, you and Angela, huh?
Yep. Pretty much.
Huh, I never really noticed.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
Yeah, kinda.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
I have a question about this scene.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
Well, that was ah...
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Who?
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
I can't help you Joey.
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Uh, we might be leaving now.
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Uh-huh.
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Yes!
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
You serious?
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Come on man, really how old?!
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Are you gonna go over there?
Joey.
You look good.
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Look, what do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you like her!
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Hey, Paul!
Yeah?
Shut up, Joey!
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
Here you go.
Oh.
All the time?
All the time!
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
Oh, you should here me.
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
They don't have those.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
Hey dude, it's me.
Hey it's Joey!
What?
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
From a bullet!
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Yeah I guess you're right.
Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
That's because all people are selfish.
Are you calling me selfish?!
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Hello.
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
Got it! So...
So uh, do you live around here?
I'll remember that.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
She was a welder.
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
It's not Christmas!
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
You bought boobs?
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
Ready, Annabelle?
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Wow! That is a bad audition.
How-how did you lose your job here?
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
I am your friend.
But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Hey guys.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
See you later Mon.
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Nothing?
I have to get back to...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Oh.
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
What was the dream about?
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
It-it doesn't?
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
The ring is gone!
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
You slept with the stripper?
Of course!!
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Oh, yay!
Oh.
Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. You Miss Geller?
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
What?!
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Oh.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
Let me see that!
All right.
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Whatever.
Fine.
Phoebe!
Secret affair!
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Probably because...
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
What?
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Woooo!!!
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
Marry me.
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
Well, do you see any babies?
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Great!! That's great!
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Good luck!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
What happened?
Why can't you tell her?
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Yeah.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Multiple orgasms!
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
So, we're having fun, right?
Yeah.
I'm kinda beat.
Actually, me too.
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
As in Rosita does not move.
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
Stevie the TV?
Is there a problem?
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
We're back on.
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
Ugh!!
What happened?
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
Oh my.
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
I'll do it.
Okay, absolutely!
All right.
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Wow. He's strict.
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Hey no problem.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Welcome home man.
A little foos?
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
Ok, that's Eric.
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
Yeah.
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
It doesn't say that in the script.
It does in mine!
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
What?
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Monica? You're Mom.
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Oh my God! Whoah!
Well, what's the part?
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
My identical hand twin!
What's an identical hand twin?
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Hi. She said yes.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Cache? Jaunty?
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
There you go!
"...by doin' it."
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
That's great.
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
All right.
All right.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
Oh my God! Whoah!
Well, what's the part?
Seriously, what-what's the part?
"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Thanks.
You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you're just so, you're so, so...
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
What?
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
You're turning into a women.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
I just hope...
You can let some of them go by!
Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Okay.
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
Yeah.
Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. .
Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Did I get it?
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
"...by doin' it."
Joe?
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Yeah!! I call that London style.
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
Can I ask you something?
Uhh, no.
No.
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
What equity investments?
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Wh-what do you mean?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
OOooooo!
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
What's in it?
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Your different here too. Your mean in England.
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
You left a shoe here?!
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Great! Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
Hey! So I'm back.
Who are you?
Show me in the table.
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don't hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Well, hello Rachel!
Have you really done this before?
Hey!
Hey-hey-hey!
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Really. What?
Why the Post?
Oh, you didn't see the Post?
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
..Naughty!
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Why don't you just take it with you?
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Okay!
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Yeah, I know!!!!
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Hey!
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Whaddya see?
You okay, kiddo?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Crazy bitch.
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Hey.
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
Hey!
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
Nice work my friend.
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
What? What?
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
Hey buddy! How's it going?
Hey!
Hey!
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
We could get that Everest video though.
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
Oh, well...
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Hey.
Hey, man. What's up?
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that...
Alrighty, here come the water works.
Hey guys!
Hey!
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Come where?
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Okay man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
I know!
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Who are you talking too?
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
What's Phase Two?
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
No I don't think so.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
And yet, we're still poking him.
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
You think I need a new walk?
What?
Are you actually saying these words?
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
No, 10 is the highest.
Why is 10 the highest?
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Okay.
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Well, I guess that's something.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
No, the quiet down thing!
You mean this.
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
And why wouldn't he get it?
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
You just give him a spoon baby!
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
How is that important?
Oh it's important!
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Thank you, Joey.
No-no, thank you.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
I'm not answering that.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Hi!
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
We've got a problem.
Tell me.
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
What?
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
What?! Tonight?!
That's what Monica said.
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.
It's a woman.
So talk to her.
Why the voice.
Hard to say.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
I figure my character has kids.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
No! No-no-no...
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
Well ah, what can you swing?
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
What kinda things have you been saying?
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
I'll be waiting.
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
It's a curling iron.
It's clean.
Yeah, well, it feels different.
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
Psss, that is whack!
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
Wouldn't she?
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
Hey there you are!
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
You realize what you are don't you?
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Please be kidding.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
Then what's the problem?
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
Hey, what did your agent say?
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Wow, he must like you the best.
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
No problem. Hey Chandler
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Needs some clothes altered?
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
Bye Phoebe.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
I can scratch that right off.
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
What, now?
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Okay, we owe you a present.
Two! I've been engaged twice!
That is the Coast Guard.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
Hey, what did your agent say?
What, forget it!
Yeah, right.
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Is all this true?
Oh Hans.
Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Oh, ok.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
How come it's not mixing with the water?
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
Ok.
No.
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
What?
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
I made fun of his accent.
The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
All right, you got it.
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
Yeah.
Y'know which one was she again?
It's gotta be the first one.
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt.
Oh, thanks!
Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
Yeah!
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Thank you.
Okay.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
That's very nice.
That's sweet, Joey.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
I don't know, I don't know.
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
You got me.
Yeah. Right.
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
He's not here right now.
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
What's the matter?
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
I've never seen it!
Oh you should, it's great.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
But we don't know the neighbors.
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
That's what you got me?
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Joey.
Yeah?
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Well there you have it!
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Friends first? That's interesting.
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
I made them!
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
The wedding starts at six.
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Okay.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
I'm sorry, what?
What?
Oh, ok.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Hmmm, that's very cool.
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
I can't believe she cracked your code!
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.
What happened?
Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
Oh my God.
OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Got it!
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
I don't know.
Okay!
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
That's sweet, Joey.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Well, what am I going to say?
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Great!
I can do that.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!
That's right!
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Oh no!
I'm comin' out!
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
What?
Five oh dollars.
That's great.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
That's not a question.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
... It's a fertility study.
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Hey.
Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
I don't have any issues with my Father.
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
Hello.
Hey!
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
Chandler?
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
I do.
I do.
No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
They actually said that?
Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
We owe you?!
We didn't give you any money!
You don't think I know that!
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Yeah. O-okay.
How about receiving?
Yes!
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Really?
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
What?!
What's wrong with you?
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
That's right.
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
All right, see ya Pheebs.
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
What?!
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
What's up?
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
That's why you broke up with me?
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
Really?! I won!
What?!
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
Yeah, I remember.
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
You'll vamp?!
How can you not remember us kissing?!
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
What was it for?
The next, next?
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Well, there you go.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Is there something wrong?
Joey...
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
Hey, Pheebs?
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Uh-huh!
Wow! Cool!
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
I didn't know you had another level.
I know! Neither did I!
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
No.
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Borrow money from me?
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
I had a donut.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Okay.
Sorry.
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
So what happens next?
God that is good TV.
Phoebs, play with meeee.
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
That-that is a good trick.
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
Your other student, was you!
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
Where's Mary-Angela?
She's right in there.
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
Okay, fine.
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
You wanna share it?
Okay!!
It's not mayonnaise!!
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Probably because...
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
Yay!!
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Hey!
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Your make-up!
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Oh yeah, no problem.
Thanks.
Joey!
Ross!
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
That is true.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
It might be kinda cool.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
That's the whole part?
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Hi!
So how was, how was your date?
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Hi!
Hey! Hiya!
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
So what, we just sit?
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Rachel! You okay?
Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
I'm having surgery!
Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
No.
Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
What we did last night was....
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
Wow!
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
You think I'm hot?
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
What? Me having a job?
No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Really?
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
It's not what you think, that was...
You told me I was the only one.
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
Somebody wanna help me out here?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Didn't you sleep together?
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
Okay.
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
What?!
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
I see where you're goin'!
What's up with the greed Joe?
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
You or me?
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
I am sorry, Chandler.
I am sorry, Ross.
This took you all day?!
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Oh, god help us.
What?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Why?
What's going on?
We all hate Emily!
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
It wasn't my decision!
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
You were in a porno?
That is wild.
So what's it shaped like?
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
What?
Cupping.
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
What? That's not? Oh my God.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
And the bunny got away.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
And I would have to say pah-huh.
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
What the hell happened?!
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
What equity investments?
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
You don't even have a car!
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
Anything but stew.
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
What if Joey were president?
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
I did, but that was really fun.
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
The Bible?!
I don't know!
Diverse.
Did anybody call for security?
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
What?! Why?!
What about the closeness?
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Hey, guys!
Hey!
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
You do, huh?
What are you talking about?
I'm not sure.
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Ewwww!!
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Joey, you had the night!
What?
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
What are you talking about?!
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Marcel?
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Ah, finally an explanation.
Joey!
Yeah?
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
Well.
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
Oh yeah.
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie...
Joey, this is awkward part.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
No.
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
So it's okay to date a student.
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
And a date with a man!
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Isn't this great?
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
Come on man, you're not a potato.
I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.
Yeah!
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Hey!
Hey.
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
Help! Help!
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Ooh, I look good.
Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
You gave her food poisoning!?
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Oh yeah!
Really?
Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
That's crazy.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
You gave her food poisoning!?
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
I have to get back to...
That's okay.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Wow.
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
It's open! Come in!
Hi!
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Ohh! A man with a plan!
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Hey! So I'm back.
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
All I say is, she better get the job.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Nice work my friend.
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
When did I try to give you money?
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
It was a dry day.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
All right, be my guest.
Good luck.
Oh, I got it.
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
Hi.
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
Great!
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
So how you two gettin' along?
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
There's another carton right over there.
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Hey, I've been married 3 times
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
It's him, not it!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Oh man!!
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
So she's a woman! So what?
Joey!!
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
Pheebs, I have to ask you...
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
I'm sorry man.
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Well when can we have this shower?
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Ohh-oh, chilling!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
I don't know you guys.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
No, I got him.
No, seriously.
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Uh, Phoebe...
Oh Ross, hi.
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
That's what you should say.
What?
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Sorry.
I'm sorry Joey.
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
So...
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Don't touch him!
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
What a nice story!
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Okay.
Yeah!
Should we call the spitter?
Hey Rachel!
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Amazingly, that makes sense.
You think?
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Stay out of my freezer!
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
In a minute!!
So this is it? Victor?
So long, Vic!
Phoebe, it's been two days.
Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Hi!
Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
As are you...
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
He took off?
Go on! Go on.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey-hey.
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
Excellent!
Uh, may I help you?
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
What the?!
Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
