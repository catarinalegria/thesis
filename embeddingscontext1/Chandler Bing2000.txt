You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Theyre twins!
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
Yeah.
Lets not do that any more.
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Probably because...
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
No, really you're gonna freeze.
No, I'm not.
Some day, maybe.
Funny book?
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
Ha!
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
What's going on?
My lighter's in there!
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
What?!
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
I got it! Scotch... tape.
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Aww, man!
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Yeah! Right!
WHAT IS IT?!
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
Wow, he must like you the best.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
No problem. Hey Chandler
I think they get it.
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Ahh!
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
I wish all guys could be like him.
I know.
He doesn't have anyone.
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Waaay too special.
I am famished. What do I want...
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
What did you just say?
Are you serious?!
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Hi!
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Okay.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
All right!
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
: That book got me through some tough times.
There is a little child inside this man!
Who's this from?
Oh, that's Ross's.
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
The second sister dies?!
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
That's correct.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Do we pay for this?
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
Hi. She said yes.
How do I look?
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
No, that's not exactly what I was..
So what do you want?
You.
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Yes, it was!
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Dude! Dude!
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
What?! Tonight?!
That's what Monica said.
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
Phoebe!
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
Hey!
You look great!
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
No. No!
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
It was my first time.
With Carol? Oh.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
You don't like that show?
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
Oh o-, OK man.
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
Oh, what the hell is that?
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
I got it! Here we go.
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Well that would help the pride thing.
Hey!
Okay.
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
So, that's it?
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
I think maybe, yeah.
He loves you.
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
Huh?!
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Could we be more white trash?
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
In the park?
Just those two!
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
And she's supposed to buy this?!
Joey, bravo!
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
I am definitely gonna watch that!
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Huh, wanna bet?
How about we play for more money, say 150?
150 dollars.
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
It's like two miles!
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!


C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Dude! How come you took off?
Is something wrong?
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
They're all tourists.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Hey, mind if I use the phone?
Oh, I...
Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Yeah, but you didn't.
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
You, you are gonna love this.
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Hey!
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
That would be great.
Okay!
I know!
Bye!!!
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Really?!
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Which guy?
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
Come on.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
But Mon, you have to get our money!
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
Hey guys.
Hey.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Oh.... my.... God.
Hey, it's Janice.
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
What's wrong with you?
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
That's a hernia.
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Yeah.
How many kids were we gonna have?
What else did you think about?
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
You guys don't think I look 19?
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
What's a Movement class?
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
I'm getting dressed.
Why?
Wait. I wanna show you something.
What is it?
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Well, the duck...
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Well that was umm...Okay.
It wasn't the best.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Well, the lighting was okay.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
Okay.
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
Oh please!
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
I don't know.
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
There are seven?!
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
You have Knicks tickets?
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
No, no, this is the first time.
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Well, let me see.
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
What?!
So you were right?
Chandler!
Chandler, what did she say?
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
Are you serious?
Does Joey know?
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Yes. Yes!
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
Good! That's good!
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
How are you?
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
I-Ohh!
There you go! There you are!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Hey!
Hey!
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Yeah!
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Okay.
All right.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Yeah.
So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
Oh, is he hungry already?
I guess so.
I gotta get one, too.
What are you guys doing?
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
I know. Thanks.
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
Yeah.
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
Well, I feel like a snack!
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
What?!
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Well then why can't I see it?
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Really?
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Where is this party?
Here in Chelsea.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
Oh!
I am so jealous.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Not if I kiss you first.
Ooh.
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
It'll be great for next weekend.
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Petrie.
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Ross?
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
No, did he hug you?!
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Hey Chandler?
Yeah?
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Look, we are not gonna...
Dah!!
But if we win, we get your apartment.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Yeah, but don't you think....
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
It's Joey's birthday.
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Oh-oh-hey!
Wow! You are really good at this.
I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now.
Hey!
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Oh, you get used to it.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Oh.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Let us keep the apartment and...
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh, I don't know.
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Oh.
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
So, let's go.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
Come on you guys, one more time.
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
It's raining men!
Amen!
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Who?
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Monica, you don't know that.
Well, who's voice was that?
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Great, I'll see you then.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Do you always have to bring him here?
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Hi.
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Ah, yeah!
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
No, ten o'clock.
What?
Oh. Hel-lo!
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
That's too hard. Too hard!
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Oh umm, not go.
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Thank you.
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Hey!
Hey.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Off to see young Ethan?
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Uh yeah, right here.
Thank you, Happy Holidays.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Okay.
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
No! That's-that's my arm!
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Okay!
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Joey! You didn't even know her!
Ah whatever!
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Well there you go.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Weird world. Your kids?
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Heh, what d'ya say?
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
No I didn't!
You love me!
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
What am I sitting on?
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
That's right baby.
All right, let me in.
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
No! I balanced my checkbook.
I can't believe he didn't come!
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
My God Monica!!
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
Ooh! So close.
Hey everybody!
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
What? Nothing.
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
Well what is it? Let me see.
Hey, someone order a coat?
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
Hey!
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Yeah, that's what I said.
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
I can't believe this!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Rifts. Yeah, I know.
Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
Not from where I was standin.
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
Do I still call you Ross?
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
No problem.
So are we...friends again?
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Good luck, honey!
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Men are here.
We make fire. Cook meat.
Ewww!
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Oh.
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Chandler.
I will.
Do you want me to call?
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Horn-swoggle.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
Hi, Pheebs!
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
Gas? Wow! Intense.
Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
Yeah.
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Well, I like it. Here you go.
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Well, yeah actually.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
We are! Help us!
Help!
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Hi honey, how did it go?
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
So what happened?
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
What?!
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
At least I care about his feelings!
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Sure!
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
And now you want that money back.
Exactly.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Come on, they were not that huge.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Hey!
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
No, I'm alright, thanks.
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
I'm Gail.
Chandler.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Nope.
Yep, yep...You?
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
Uh-huh.
Well no, but um.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
Ohh! I did not get that.
Yeah, it's good.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
Oh, really?
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Hey.
Hey.
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
It's Joey's birthday.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
You mean they like you.
Maybe.
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
That's very funny!
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Really?
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Whoa!
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
I call it!!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Hi, Julie!
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
Hey.
Hey! So, did you quit?
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
And that's funny, why?
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
8. 8!
Thank you!
Yay!!
8!
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Uh-huh.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Eww!
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Nooo!
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
You did the right thing.
I don't like this anymore.
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
Why? What you'd do?
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
C'mon hurry, hurry.
Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.
OK.
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
What's the matter?
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
Really.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Tah-daaah!
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Needs some clothes altered?
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
You didn't find her?
No, I've looked everywhere!
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
That's great!
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Awwwww...
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Hey!
Hi Pheebs!
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
She will be after tonight.
Yeah.
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
A big idiot.
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
Hi.
Hi.
Yes?
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
I don't what your talking about.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
You will like it!
No I won't.
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
Huh?
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
He is so amazing.
Oh, I know. Look at him.
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
That's great!
Excellent!
That is so good! Do it again!
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
There y'go, kids.
You seen Sandy?
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
Looks good, uh?
Yeah.
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Why? I love that thing.
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.
Y-, y-, you like that show?
You don't like that show?
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
Yeah.
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Hey!
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Huh, wanna bet?
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Hey!
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Anybody gonna eat that?
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
I know, I can do this.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Between you and...
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Hey!
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Is Joey here?
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
What is it?
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Does it hurt?
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
Op, op, I'm convinced!
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
All right!
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
So are we...friends again?
Yeah.
What 'cha doing Mon?
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
Okay that does sound like fun.
The second sister dies?!
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
What-what's so funny?
Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Okay.
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Yeah.
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Okay.
She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Stop what?!
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
What?
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Why not?
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
Really?!
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
I found a dried up seashores.
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Yay!
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Still?!
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Two.
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Noo! Nothing!
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
I'm gonna call after you!
Woooo!!!
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
That's him.
Phoebe?
Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Bakersfield!
No-no I heard! I'm just sorry.
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
What?
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
What?
I have no idea what you just said.
Put Joey on the phone.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Wow.
Still doing the screening thing?
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Oh, good job Joe.
Wow, it's big!
Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Noo! Angels.
I'm gettin' my chair back!
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Joey, why is your cable out?
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
When did I try to give you money?
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
Okay.
Really?
I know! I know.
Okay.
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
This is Patrick.
Hi.
Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
Yeah?
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
Well, thanks again for lunch.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
Well, there you go.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
And why not?!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
No reason, except...she...told...me.
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Hey, Mon, what is this?
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
Awww!
Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
What?!
What?!
Why does anyone have to be naked?
Why is Ross naked?
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Why not?!
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
Yeah, what?
What?
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
I got glasses!
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
...I'm, I'm okay.
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
You got it.
Okay.
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Here just...take this.
That's stealing!
Ohh.
Okay, one thing at a time.
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Consider Casey.
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Hey!
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Tony?
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Come on.
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
So...Thank you.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Weird world. Your kids?
I figure my character has kids.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Do you even know who Kip is?
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Oh, that poor bastard.
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
That's so gross!
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
I think you smell great!
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Now, have you told anyone else?
You told me.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Oh, we could do this all day.
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
OK.
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
This is for the fourth grade.
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Put Joey on the phone.
What's up man?
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Drum roll.
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
You're definitely scaring here.
Would you like to call somebody?
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Screw the Knicks!
Whoa!
Huh.
And the Knicks rule all.
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Oop, your cake is ready!
Oop!
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
Who the hell are you?!
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
You're-you're what?!
I love you too Chandler.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Wafer thin ice!
Hey, I'm back!
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
What are you doing?
Waiting for candy.
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
We want candy! We want candy now!
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
'Tonight' tonight?
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Absolutely!
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
Oh, here.
See now it feels like Christmas!
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Yes!
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Not now, I'm sick!
Oh come on you big faker!
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
But, I love you.
And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
Hey you guys, guess what?
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Wish me luck.
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
You promised you would break up with her!
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
Yeah, well...
We could get that Everest video though.
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Oh, well...
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Next time?
Ooh, so close.
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Well, thanks.
Well, you know.
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
I'll talk to her.
I hate actors.
Excuse me.
Ahhhh.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Let me see the earrings.
Oh, honey, the earrings...
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
And ya know what, now I've got closure.
Try the bottom one.
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Oh, that's funny!
I want a baby.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Oooo-ooh!
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Come on look guys, don't fight.
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Hi!
Hey, you're back too!
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Why is that so funny?
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Double it!
What?
Really?
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
More importantly, was I any good?
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
I love it, when we share.
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
So where you gettin' it?
I think on my shoulder.
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
This, this actually is a...
Hey!
Oh, yeah.
Do we have to make the entire thing?
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
Alright.
Hi.
Hi.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Tell him.
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Why?
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Well, we certainly are alone.
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Right.
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Mon, get out here!
Monica!
Why do I have to decide?
Because you're the only one that can be fair.
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Another hard 8.
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Something wrong?
No. Nothing.
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
What about things that are already gold?
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Chandler?
Hi. Hi.
What are you doing here?
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
What?
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Give him money? It was a joke!
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Two!
Three!
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Eh!
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Yeah.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
What, what's what you mean?
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Nice car!
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Is that a real thing?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
What's up?
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
I can't smell your sandwich?
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Okay.
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Big night!
This is so cool!
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Okay, he's a senior in college.
College?
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
What?
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Hey, man. What's up?
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
How is it you?
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
What are you doing?
No, only because that's the graduation song.
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Okay!
No, but that's bad!
What?!
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Okay, this one I like!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
Um-hmm.
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
What?!
Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
Chandler, is that...
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Why?
Why would you kill his fish?
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
How was your first day?
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Hey!
Why?!
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
...Quality, right, great.
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
What? He's cute!
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Hey.
What's the matter?
Oh Willie's still alive!
What are you guys doing?
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Uh-huh.
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
You got it.
Okay, see ya later.
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
He just said, "No strippers."
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
How about those three pointers?
Amazing!
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
See you later.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
Oh no!
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Well yeah, but then...
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Your messages have been erased.
Noooooooo!
No. But that reminds me, sign this.
What is it?
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
What-what Richard thing?
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
No, I'm Mary-Theresa.
I am!
Oh, this is soo bad.
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
WHOAA!!
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
But we're not ready to tell yet!
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
So what are you guys out doing today?
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
Ohhhh man
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
No, but I'm gonna!
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
For three years?
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
"Smoke away."
What?
Relax your hand!
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
That is correct.
The Irish gig guy?!
Gentlemen, you're pick.
It's All Relative.
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Well all right, one thing happened?
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
That would be nice.
Pardon?
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Right.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
I'm not macho.
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Yeah?
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Really.
What, uh... what juggling thing?
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
And we don't work hard?
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
And you feel like we hold you back.
Yes.
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Who?
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
I don't think tho.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
Hat, milk, got it.
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
I know. Ross is getting married.
Phoebe is, making people.
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
What about when I started dating Chandler?
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Here, I brought you some flowers.
Thanks!
Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?
Yeah, welcome.
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
Hello?
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
That's the rule.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Umm, cups.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
Rach, did you check the machine?
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
All right! You can have the chair.
Really!
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Why not?
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
Hi.
Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Yeah, I'll sit down.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
Really?
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
I'll go with you.
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Isn't there a national football league.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Ohhh.
What's wrong with the twentieth?
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
I'm Margha.
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
Hello, Chandler.
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Oh!
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh boy me too!
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Hey Rach?
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Are you serious?!
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Maybe it was the guy.
It was the ring!
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
I got a gig!
Yay!!
Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!
What's the part?
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
Are you travelling with a child?
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Shall I carve?
By all means.
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Is this guy great or what?
Yeah, yeah he is.
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
I know.
You're a really good kisser.
Hm-hmm!
Okay!
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
What's up?
You do?
Yeah.
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Oh my God!
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
Dude!
Sorry!
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
Well, I'm from California.
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
I'll have coffee.
Yeah, me too.
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
She?
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Excuse me?
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
So what are you gonna do?
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
Pheebs!
Hey!
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
She-she died Jill.
Chandler!
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Carol?
Sure.
Uh, does it hurt?
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
Nine.
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
I am?
Sure, why not?
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
Why, what happened?
What is the worse part?
I can't remember which sister.
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Rachel! That was a library card!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
No.
No.
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
No! No! No! I can't do that!
Why not?!
What's wrong with being the Bings?
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
That's the rule.
How'd you get to that?
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
One ticket to Yemen?
I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
It so does not!!!
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
No?
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Do we have to?
No.
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Really?! You do that?
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
You have really great hair.
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
So this is your office?
What the hell are you doing?!
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Stop it!
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Yeah?
Geez! Are you ready?
Whoa! You had sex today?
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
'My scones.'
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Did not.
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Let them win one.
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
No. Not anymore.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
I want you to say that you like her!
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
How could you have told her?
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Thanks!
Yeah right.
Why is that so funny?
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Ohh-oh, chilling!
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Alimony.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
How is that worse?!
I don't know! But it's the same!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
So take care.
You too.
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Sophie's desk.
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
How do you not fall down more?
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Well at least we know she's a woman.
I can't believe she's married.
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
All right.
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
God, your hair sure is different!
So uh, where's Monica?
She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
I'm intrigued.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Since when are you into swing music?
Chandler.
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
True story!
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
Yeah me too.
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Why don't you open with a joke?
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
Okay!
Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Morning. We ready to go?
It was a really beautiful service.
It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Okay.
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Why would you kill his fish?
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
Yeah.
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
That's me.
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Oh, mine's December...
Yeah, whatever.
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
I could die.
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
What is this?
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Oh, no thanks.
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
Good luck!
Out!
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.

Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Dude! He's right there!
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Can I finish my story?!
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Oh, ohhhhh.
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Alright open your eyes.
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
Hello New York!
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
Hi Chandler.
Hey!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
We didn't ruin it!
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
Glove salesman!
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
What?
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Not once did we do that.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Do you realize you get louder each week?
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Waaa-aaah.
What?
Yeah, so.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Let me see that! Oh man!
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
I made a...
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Ok, you win.
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
Uh huh. Why is that?
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
I sure did.
Why?
Well, you're amazing.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Wow, how many have you got?
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
No! Ahhh!!!
I don't believe this!
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Hey.
Hey.
I'll get it.
Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Come here. Okay, be right back.
We're switching rooms.
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
That word was swans.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
The meeting with the guy went great?
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
What are you going to make?
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!

There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Hey.
Hey! Good, you're home!
Hey baby.
Hey.
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Well, I'm there too!
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
I'm so sorry!
Sorry!
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
What happened to the foosball?
Ah that's a cantelope.
He paid a lot of money for it.
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
Please.
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Well, thank you for lunch.
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
Its still there!
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
Hi.
How's it going?
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
C'mon, it's my birthday.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
I mean, this is unbelievable.
I know. This is really, really huge.
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
BEND OVER?!!!
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought.
...And what did you bring?
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
Joey, why is your cable out?
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Whoa ho.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
I got it! Here we go.
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
No?
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Well where did she go?
Well she said she had to think things over.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
You were trying to eat it!
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
What are you talking about?
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
Well where... Where did she go?
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
I know what your problem is.
Oh you do, do you?
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Thank you, buddy.
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
So how was Joan?
I broke up with her.
Come on, they were not that huge.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
I'm not macho.
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Bye.
Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Oh my God!
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
So how'd it go?
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
No! No! Not, Paris.
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Oh my God! That is so good!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
There I am!
Are you okay?
What?!
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Oh, So you can move them!
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
Hi.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Is it on?
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
So, what're you gonna do?
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
I've never slept with someone for a part.
Well is she...
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Oh, come on! Come on!
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Well, then can we meet him?
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Chandler!
Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
There's our star!
So, so, what'd ya think?
I-I wasn't in that.
I know.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
Huh.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
... the WENUS?
Oh. That WENUS.
So what're you going to do?
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
So where are we going next?
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
I can't sleep now.
You want me to sing?
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Where've you been?
At the vet.
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Hey! He beat ya.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
This should be fun.
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
That would be no.
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
I thought your time ran out.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
Oh.
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Yeah?
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
That's me! Come on!
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Well that's how I feel.
Well then maybe you should take it.
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Funny story!
You're not going to believe this!
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Again?
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
The Ross-Is that back?!!
Hi!
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Okay, great.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
We're switching rooms again.
What? Why?
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.
Hello.
No he, he moved out and I moved in.
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
My-Oh my God!
I know! They suck!!
I know!
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Ready!
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
This is not a sign!
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Five.
How many guesses do you get?
Six.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Why?
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Oh my God! That's David!
David who?
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Hi!
That is one good looking man!
Sooo, you've been doing this long?
No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Nooo.
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Yeah!
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Oh, well great.
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
The balloon?
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Keep going.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Get out!!
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
No.
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
No.
No.
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Well maybe I love ya'.
.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Okay!
Come on, no peeking!
Okayyyyy, open up!
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Because, I'm too afraid.
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Rachel?
Yeah.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Well, I never call me.
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
You're bachelor pad?!
Have you even had a girl up here?
Yeah, you do!
Come on!
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Nice to meet you.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Chandler!
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
Oh, that was my work laugh.
Really? Your work laugh?
All right, check me out.
Okay.
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Hello, funny Valentine.
Hi, Just Janice.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Bye-bye-e!
Bye.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Oh my God!
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Sure. I'll help you.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Ohh.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Who the hell is Carl?!
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
The only problem!
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
No thanks, Josephine.
Ohh, hi, Kim.
Hi Rachel.
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
You knew about that?
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Why don't you just take it with you?
Why don't you just call her?
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Yeah, o-okay.
So...
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
It doesn't say that. Does it?
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
Nice to meet ya.
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Umm, this is nice.
I know, it is isn't it?
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
This is the most special day of our lives.
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Oh, okay. Here you go.
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait!
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
I'm gonna have to give him up.
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
What?
That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
So?
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Y'miss it?
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
That's ridiculous!
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
When did that happen to you?!
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
What's you point man?
Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
Yeah, I'm her date.
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
Ya know, the man's got a point.
What is that sparkly thing?
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Bad London!
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Only here.
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
No.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
All right, bye-bye.
We'll give you Janice.
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Oh no, you're the best.
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Alright, let's do this.
Alright.
Whad'ya mean?
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
Marcel?
Hi, can I help you?
A monkey.
Yes have you seen any?
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
Oh, you should here me.
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
They don't have those.
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
What thing? What thing?
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
What thing? What is this thing?
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Hey!
Hi.
Yeah, it did.
So, I guess this is over.
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
I'm a little busy here Paul.
That's exactly what my dad used to say!
Five more seconds.
Okay!
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
We're very happy for you.
What's the matter?!
All right, I'll take care of it.
Oh no, wait! Joey!
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
All right, what's going on there?
Where were your parents?
Oh they didn't want to come!
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Man!
Hi!
Do you have a minute?
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Paris?
Keep talking.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Y'miss it?
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
Fine! Get out!
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
She already lives in London.
Then you go to Tokyo.
It is not over! You're over!
What?
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
Let's go!
No-no-no! We need something old!
That'll work!
I don't think so.
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Oh thanks.
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
Ready!
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Okay, fine.
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Uuuh.
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
What?
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
I know!
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Yeah? Hi!
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Hey! You're wearing pants!
It's 9:30 in the morning!
They got a breakfast buffet.
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
About what?
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Okay, I...
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Hey-hey, what's going on?
Thanks for telling me!
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
I gave you one job!
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
I just... can't do it.
Boys? We're going in.
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
That's not a question.
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Thanks.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
Then why would he say it?
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
Hey, Janice.
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
What?
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Oh, in that case--Yay! That was me hopping on board.
Oh.
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
Yes, I am!
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Oh my God! What happened?
So, how was your date?
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
That's fun.
Here you go.
Thank you. Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, you're on.
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Oh God!
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
They tore it down a few days early.
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
Really? To what?
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
Hey!
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
I'm sorry.
Ohhh. Don't go.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
: I thought we had them!
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
Oh, time's up.
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Why?
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
At a fake game!!
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
No.
Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
We don't have to come up with this now.
Oh good.
Changes?
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Well, thanks.
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
I don't know.
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
...little playthings with yarn?
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Who's singing?
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Sorry.
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
I guess we just keep dancing.
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Huh. That's nice.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
What-what are you doing?
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
What?!
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
I'm having a really good time!
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
You have really great hair.
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
What-what 'cha doin'?
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
What?!
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
Ohh.
Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
Aaahhhh. AAAAHHHHHH.
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Woah!
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
You know what makes the itching even worse?
That you don't stop talking about it.
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
So was it a lot more money?
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
Oh, you're-you're going?
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
Hi.
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
No you can't.
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Okay.
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
Yeah, it is.
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
...He's in.
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Raymond Chandler.
Someone you didn't make up!
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
What?! Noooo...
We didn't ruin it!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Ohh, I love birds.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Hey!
What are you doing here, Santa?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
What?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
You really think that'll work?
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Well, I did not know that.
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
Yeah, I remember.
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
Thanks.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Just please stop!
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Awwwwwwww.
Does anybody want these?
Hey.
Hey!
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
I can't believe you're not picking me.
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
So, you feel like a dad yet?
No, why?
Oh, look, he's waking up!
hey, fella! How you doing?
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
Oh.
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
You're meeting Richard?
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
Oh, you're-you're going?
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Where are they? Where are they?
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Eww, I don't wanna do that.
Here we go.
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Why?
Fat?!
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
I brought you something.
I had them made special.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Hey Joe!
Hey!
Hey, Pheebs!
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
Oh my God!
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
I know!!
Okay, then get the lobster!
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Well that sounds fun too.
Have you ever been with a woman?
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
More of Grandma's teramisu.
That dies with me.
So will I.
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Yes!
Seriously?
I'm 30!
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Thanks!
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
Come on.
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
Hey, I went up.
What?
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
I know.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
I do NOT want this unit!!
Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!
Thank you.
Okay.
What's wah-pah?
Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Changes?
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Is that a problem?
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Pretty much.
All right.
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
Oh my God!
You're smoking again?!
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Even with me?
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Nuh-uh.
Yuh-huh.
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
Hi.
Hey!
Ah-ha!
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
You think we're ready for something like that?
Why not?
Why, are you moving out?
I'm not moving out.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
'Cause I was sitting there.
But then you left.
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
She really said that?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Which one was Pete Carney?
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Just those two!
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
Here.
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
Are you serious?
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Joey!
Yeah?
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
I'll be waiting.
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
No.
Phoebe. Hi.
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
What? Mine aren't tinted.
Chandler!!
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Dude, don't do that too me!
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Hey!
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
I'm reading your ad.
Looks good, uh?
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
I will not take this abuse.
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Yeah, all of us! All day!
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Well, this has been fun.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Is anybody else scared?
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
Oh, now you want a pad.
Hey!!
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Yeah.
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
One second.
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
It's so secluded up here.
I know. I like it up here.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Hi!
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
No!! You can't!!
Look, they must be stopped!
I need juice! People need juice!!
Look man!
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
You bitch.
Whip it out, whip it out.
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Sir.
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Eh?
Really?
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Yes, Denise. Denise!
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Well, you know.
Uh-huh.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
Love....
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Yeah, you should, really.
Go on.
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
Your last roommate's kidney?
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Well, look at that, same thing.
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Oh, hello Rachel.
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Alrightalrightalright. There.
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Please, can't you help me out?
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
Op, I like credit cards!
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Come on, we can't let them win!
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
I know. My arm is killing me.
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
What's going on?
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Ive never done that.
Im sayin I see a difference.
Theyre twins!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
I do like that.
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
Hey.
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Okay, there.
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
Oh.
Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
Awesome!
Yeah?
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
Hey!
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Really?
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Maye it's me.
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
There we go. All better.
There's my little boy.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
OK.
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Tell me what?
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Doing it on this table.
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
Those were like the best seats ever.
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
Oh. Oh, God!
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh yeah!
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
Hey.
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Well, I did not know that.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
By me?
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
I know!
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
That was so lame.
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Okay. It's a racecar.
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Right! And when is that due?
First of the month.
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Okay.
Okay.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Yeah.
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
Of course!
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
She's not here and please come in.
Okay, she was here, but she left.
Well where did she go?
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Oh! Oop!
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Hi guys.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
That's my first name.
Right, okay, then no.
Yay!
See? Here we go.
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Yeah, I do, yeah.
Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!
Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
So what're you guys gonna eat?
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
I want you right here, right now.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
You got it.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
I didn't know you had another level.
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
Picking Rachel.
That's right. Did you hear something?
It's coming from the living room.
I finished my book.
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
I'll take that.
You want his yearbook?
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
It's really not that big!
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Well, if you think it will help.
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
There he is!
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Me.
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Monica's pregnant.
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?
Cigarettes?!!
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Hey, it's me.
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
What?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
That word was swans.
Oh! Oh my God!
Merry Christmas!!
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Uh-huh.
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
You want some help.
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
You are so great! I love you!
What?
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No I didn't!
Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
Oh, yeah.
You comin'?
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
Sure.
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
What did you tell them?
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
Oh, no.
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
Yeah baby!
Oh.
But then later that night...
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
Cups.
I don't know how to play Cups.
All right.
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Can I just say one thing?
What? What?!
Oh!!
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
No kidding.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Because the winner gets this!
The Geller Cup.
Yeah.
Okay, good.
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
Oh that's me, I gotta go.
Oh uh, o, OK.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Oh, I know.
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Oh thank you.
Okay.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
Yeah.
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
Oh, hi!
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
Woo-hoo, stuud!
What's she look like?
Woo-hoo, geeek!
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
It doesn't say that!
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
There you go!
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
You really didn't have to. Wow.
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .
Oh, yeah... yeah.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
All right!
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Hey Joe!
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Hi!
Hi.
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Yes!!
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Really?! You promise?
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Hey!
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Men are unbelievable.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Hey, you know about that?!
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
Oh really, you guys tryin' again?
Yeah.
C'MON!
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Friends first? That's interesting.
You become friends after?
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Why is your family Ross?!
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
Hi Pheebs!
Hi!
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
Well, how much do you think he needs?
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
My Giant? I love that movie!
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Huh.
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Is there a Julio here?
I am Julio.
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
You're right, I know.
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
How do you figure that?
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Umm, jealous!
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Um-hmm.
Not really.
Well there you have it!
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
Alright.
OK. Just for a little while.
OK.
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Why? What happened now?
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Each.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Hey Monica, it's Chip.
Yesss!!
Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
Score.
She is so hot!
Pheebs?
Yeah?
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
You did?
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
I did.
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Umm, oh, about three months.
Hey!!
Hey!
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
What do you say?
You're bachelor pad?!
Have you even had a girl up here?
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Multiple orgasms!
No plans, huh?
Not a one.
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Hey guys! What's...
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Put it on.
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
I so am.
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
I ran!!
Actually, me too.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
We have free porn here!!!
Hey!
Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
All right.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
I can check that for ya.
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Yeah, what's that about?
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Oh, I can still do that.
How are you still single?!
Good. What made you change your mind?
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Well no, but um.
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
Hey!
Don't come out here!
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
: Your Visa bill is huge!
Give me that!
I don't know.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Karen.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Okay, here we go. Ready?
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
Ooh, your brother. Score!
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Hey.
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
All right.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
How are you feeling?
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Please!
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Oh, now I have to go!!
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
Uh, Julie.
Yeah?
Hi everyone.
Hi.
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Well, apparently she does.
Hey! What's going on?
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Are you not seeing him anymore?
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
Umm, yeah.
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Volleyball.
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Dennis.
Ok, that's me.
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
What did you say?
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Her answer machine?
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
Oh.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
C'mon hurry, hurry.
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
All right.
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
The doctor.
Is everything okay?
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
What?!!
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
They're gonna call her Chandler.
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
So, should I call him back?
Noo! NO!
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
All right!
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
That is so good! Do it again!
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
No no, that's me.
Oh, yeah.
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Done!
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
Hey.
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
What?
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
We don't need to remedy that.
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Why two?
Because it's faster.
Oh!
All right, but in the future...
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Hey!
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Really? Right across the street?
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
I'm pregnant.
Pregnant?!
...Then I've already seen this one!
Are you through with that?
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
Who wrote it?
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
Okay, can we please go eat?
Yeah. What are we getting?
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Weren't you nine?!
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
Him? Him, Ross?
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Yeah, why not?
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
No reason, except...she...told...me.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
You mean like, music?
Come in!
Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
That was...so good.
Hey.
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Not if you're gonna be like this!
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
Y'think?
Yeah!
C'mon! C'mon!
Here goes.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Do you want a date Saturday?
Yes please.
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
What?!
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
God, I love these fingers...
Thank you.
Oh my God, I'm late.
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
I will go for that drink.
Each.
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
I KNEW IT!!!!
Gin.
Will you stop!
Okay. All right.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
The lights, please..
...How long was I in there?
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Hey.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
And twenty-five it is.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Well, I have a call in about that.
'Kay.
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Um... hi there.
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Yeah, yeah!
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
That was me.
That's okay.
That's all right.
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Ehh.
Eh, you work for that.
You do?!
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
We're never gonna find anybody.
Well then let me do it!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Hey Joe!
I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Yes, we should. I think we should.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Yeah, it is.
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
You're okay there?
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Hello Rachel.
Get off.
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
That's a line from the show too!
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
Yeah?
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
You wanna play?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
I'm intrigued.
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
So?
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Awww. But still no.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Really? Who's number two?
Uh, no, it's-it's just this person.
Like a date type person?
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Come on, let me see that smile.
I don't wanna.
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...
I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
I-I think we have too.
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Well, Joey's my best friend.
I'm not your best friend?
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
Okay. Oh yes.
Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Okay.
What happened?
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
Yeah. You!
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Love is the best medicine.
That's laughter.
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Whad'ya mean?
No, you can't use your watch.
Ok.
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Yeah, so?
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Why?
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
You have three nipples?
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Bye! Thank God
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
What?!
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
So uh, what did this woman look like?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
All I say is, she better get the job.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
Okay.
Hey! New wallet, huh?
Rachel!
What?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Well, there you go.
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
You're welcome.
Did you smoke?
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Karen.
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
We were out of Doritos.
Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
Still?!
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
Yeah!
Hey!
Hey!
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
What?!! Gross!!
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Yeah baby! No baby!
No because it-it didn't seem important.
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Well, apparently she does.
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Well, my nose got lonely.
Hi, I'm Lisa.
Hi.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Hi there.
That's that weird voice again.
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
Hi!
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Why not?
Hey man.
Hey!
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Don't blame the questions!
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
But it is our apartment!
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Just pickle.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Or not, whatever.
This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Okay. Will you marry me?
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
This is crazy.
I know! Robin is so gay!
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
You're right.
Yeah!
Okay.
Okay great.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Oh!!
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
I say push her down the stairs.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
Please tell me you got the message!
What message?
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
I'm Monica.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Ohh.
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
Totally!
We don't have to come up with this now.
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh my god.
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
We did?
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
Hello, Chandler Bing.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
But, I love you.
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
Why?
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
I, I know.
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
What were you modeling for?
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
I'm already here.
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
No, the little girl creeps me out.
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
But the mess!
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Hey. Where's Joey?
I think he's across the hall.
Thanks.
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
Oh.
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
He's kind of intense huh?
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Oh, okay. Here you go.
Hey, where's the chicken?
Great. I'll see you later!
Okay, bye!
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
That's my pie!
Which smells delicious!
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Another hard 8.
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Go! Come on! Roll!
Roll-roll!!
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Oh, my.
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Why? Why can't you go to him?
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Did you break up with her?
Why?
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
You pick one.
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Good choice.
Thanks.
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
Hello?
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
What's-what's the difference?
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
Knock, knock.
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
It's Monica's bed. What?
Okay. It's a racecar.
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
It was my racquet.
I was frustrated with you!
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Oh my God. He threw up?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Why not her?
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
Joey that is horriable.
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Your boyfriend is so cool.
Really?
Wow, he must like you the best.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
No! We only mess around at his place!
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
No, I haven't seen him.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Yeah, why?
No reason.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
What?!! What?
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
He's... new.
No, that's not exactly what I was..
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
She's bluffing!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
I'm sorry Joey.
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Ross came in forth and cried!
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Who is Maria?
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
No!
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Our little boy is getting married.
Oh look at you! So handsome!
Are you Chandler?
Are you Joey?
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Oh, sure! I'm sure.
I know.
Ennnh.
I've got canned goods.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
What?
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
Quick volleyball question.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
You're actually going through with this?
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
Yeah, I do.
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
For three years?
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
Okay!
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
Oh uh, o, OK.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
No one was around to hear that?
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
What about him?
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Are you seein her again tonight?
Yep. Ice Capades.
I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
Here's your tea Phoebe.
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Oh.
Joe. How's it going?
Good. Hey.
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Really?
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Oh.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
Hey!
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
What does it say?!
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Thanks! So are you.
I told you I should not wear this color.
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Hey-hey-hey Joey!
Hey Terry!
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Hey!
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Oh, youre gonna be great!
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Wherere you going?
Out.
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Thanks for telling me!
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Okay, great!
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
I'll take sports.
Mine!
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Oh, okay.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
You're so efficient. I love you!
Let's go!
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
You left a shoe here?!
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Great! Thanks.
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
I'm gonna do it.
I don't know what else to say.
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Hey!
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
What do you mean?
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's...
Come here.
Are you sure?
Beefsteak Charlie's?
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
No, I got him.
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Hey.
How was your conference?
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
Sort of...
Guys, what's going on?
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
Which one?
...The second guy.
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
That's not what she said last night.
See? Now, he could date her.
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Hey!
Thank you soo, much.
You want some help with that?
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
I was in too much pain.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
What kind of changes?
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Why?
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
I gotta go!
Hey.
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
About a half an hour.
Lovely!
No.
Why not?
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Quick! What time is it?!
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
Yeah?
Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
I don't know, I don't know.
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Hey, what's goin' on?
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
Talk to me.
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
What the hell are you doing?!
She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
No! No! No! I can't do that!
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
What?!
So you were right?
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Come on, two on one.
What, now?
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
What?
You, you want, you want me to move out?
Uh-huh.
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Yeah, Big Brother.
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Eh...
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo.
Wow.
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
When I got married you slept with my sister.
That was pretty 007.
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
What?
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
What is this? Fruit?
Monica's making jam.
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Hey-hey listen...
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
What?
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.
See ya.
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
I say, punch him Joey.
Yeah! Punch him!!
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Hi, Julie!
Hi, Julie.
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
This was your idea?
What were you thinking?
Yeah. You!
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Okay.
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
All right!!
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Yeah.
Well, those were seals, man.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Hey!
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
Twice.
Man, I sure miss Julie.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Why not?
Oh.
DANGER!!!!!
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
You want me to wear your panties?
Could ya?
OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.
Oooh.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Rach? What are you doing?
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
What?
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Uh, 10:30.
What time is it now?
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
No.
Five more and I'll flash you.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Right.
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
Oh yeah, that's over.
What?!
He shot a bird!
Oh that is over!
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
No.
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Okay, great.
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Who's he huggin'?
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
We use it!!
There you go!!
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
One ticket to Yemen?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Still broken?
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Nah, not my game.
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Hey!
It's almost our anniversary!
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Huh.
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
I did.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
'Scuse me.
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
How did you--?
Thanks.
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
What happened?!!
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't- I mean, I-
I know-
I can't believe you did this.
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
Hi.
Hey.
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Whoa ho.
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
Sure.
Paid your phone bill?
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
I knew you were not okay with that.
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Because!
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Someone in there?
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
Why should we?
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
You got a problem with that?
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
No! No! Not, Paris.
When?
I don't know exactly.
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Good.
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Why not?
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
So how'd it go?
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
She laughed at you?
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
Freedom!
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Sophie sit!!
No! God, would you just calm down!
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
All right.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Ross!
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Sure.
No problem.
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Cool.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Waaa-aaah.
What?
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Ohh that's sweet!
Oh my God!
I know, but just let me say it.
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
Goodnight.
Um, thank you for the gift.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
Uh, the book?
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
I'm not mad.
Really?!
Great!
Okay, London 1...
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
It's me. I'm the other guy.
What?
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.
What?
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
Yeah.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
Who?
It's me. I'm the other guy.
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Oh, okay, thanks.
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
Oh, you should here me.
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
Yeah.
No, we never do that
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
The fear?
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
Because, I'm too afraid.
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
Hi.
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
Thanks.
Oh, oh, c'mon in.
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
I know I love you!
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
No that could kill her.
Well, we don't want that.
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
OK.
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
You mean this.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Okay.
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Oh... Uh...
So, who's the lucky guy?
Well, she saw the ring.
Did she freak out?
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Yeah! You wanna come?
Yeah!
Can I help you?
Uh-oh.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
Oh please!
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
No way, forget it.
C'mon, she's your mom!
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
What?
You're in my seat.
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Shhhh!
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
What? That's like insanely easy!
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
It's a good play, isn't it?
Okay, I...
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
I can do that!
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Okay.
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Okay.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Nooo!
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
Thank you.
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
What?
I feel...
But I made cards!!
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
What?!
Oh my God, you guys!!
Who?
Richard!
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Oh. That WENUS.
So what're you going to do?
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Um... hi there.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
No, Janice.
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Hey, is Rachel here?
No.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
I don't like your massages.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Let's go watch it at your place.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Oh my god!
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
I know, it's horrible isn't it?
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
Hm-mm.
Ohh!
We're sorry honey.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
How could you lose him?
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
...Hm.
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
You gotta take the canoe!
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
Good for you!!
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Thank God.
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Stop it!
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Yeah?
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
Pass it! Pass it!
He's open!
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
All right, buddy!
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Come on, it's fun!
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Yeah, so.
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
What?! What?!
Oh yes!
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Nooo!
Please!
Wow! What's that like?
It's like this, me, no jokes.
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
'Kay!
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Weren't you nine?!
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
Ohh that's sweet!
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Hey.
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
That's great! That's wonderful!
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
Um-mm, yeah right!
He's so cute.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Oh yeah...
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Could you guys help me?
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Mm-mmm.
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
I know. That's what I told her.
Really.
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
What about your breath?!
Okay. I can do that.
Okay.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
But I love swing music!
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Well, what is the other reason?
I don't want to say.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
You told her before you told us?
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
What's with him?
Ugh!
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
You got all that from the back of her head?
Who's Elaine?
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
What?
She wants to meet you in person.
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
Okay, I'll do it!
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Well, like father, like son.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh boy me too!
Yeah?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
How could you tell her?!
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Du-ude!
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
We should?
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Centerpieces!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Uh-huh!
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Hey.
What?
Do you say this stuff to girls?
Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
By someone besides Monica?
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
What?
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Dude!
God!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
If you wanna call that a reason.
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Honestly? Me too.
Really?
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Okay. I'll be right there.
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
I think it went into me.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
Ok, who ordered what?
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
Congratulations.
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
C'mon, tell us.
Yeah, is she really 20.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Dark red.
Yes, you are so smart!
Aww, you guys are so cute!
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Hmm.
Chandler is fantastic!!
What?!
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
You serious?
Oh yes!
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
Have you seen Joey?
What's the matter?
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
What's going on?
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Pshhshhh!
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
Hi!
Hi!
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
We said seven!
We said six!
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
Hi!
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
That really was some of your best work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
Okay.
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
What?
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
You don't need to fill these silences.
Oh, okay, thanks.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
Hey no problem.
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Welcome home man.
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Right.
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
Well, I think so.
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Hi!
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
What?!
Chandler, what were you thinking?
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
You okay over there?
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Hey!
Hi!
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
You could say that.
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
I don't know.
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
Right in there!
Hey!
Hey!
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Ummmmmmmm, no.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
It's 4:30.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
You-you do?
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
No.
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
What what what what?
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Hey.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Yeah?
Good call!
What's my last name?
Central Perk?
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Never had that dream.
No.
And they weren't looking at you before?!
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Nooo, it wasn't.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Hey, I've been honing!
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
What?!
Okay, break-up's still on!
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Hi guys!
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Oh great!
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
See you later Rach.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Why are your eyes so white?
Oh my God!!
All right!
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Yes that was a nice place!
Yeah!
Yeah!
What are we gonna do?
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
Hey, be right there.
There's a game?
It's the basketball playoffs.
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
What is she doing here?
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Great!
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Hey.
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Hey!
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Where ya going?
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Am I naked again?!
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
No no no!
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Yeah, alright.
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
Don't you have to use the bathroom?
Someone in here.
Where's Chandler?
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Come on look guys, don't fight.
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
Oh. Hel-lo!
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
You guys, I am not that bad!
Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
I can't believe we live here!
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
People can hear you.
I know!!
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
How'd you get to that?
You knew about that?
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
Whoa, you are very beautiful.
Oh, thank you.
Honey, what's the matter?
I just saw Janice.
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
Does it hurt?
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
About what?
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Ready? Wrestle!
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Joey's not going.
I didn't finish my five pages.
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
Have you been here all night?
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
Daaahhhh!
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
I wa-
Uuuh.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
That's all you're basing this on?
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
But I'm...
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Sure. Okay.
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
You mean scared.
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Monica?
What?!
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
Okay.
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Honey, this will help.
Uff.
That is never good.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
This bicep?
Well it's not flexed right now!
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
Uh-huh, yeah.
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
Nighty-nite.
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
What?!
Can you really do that?
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
You betcha!
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Are you alright?
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Hey, my Father's house does that!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Hmm.
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
Good morning.
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Well, I like it. Here you go.
Oh, I embarrass you?
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Uh, sure, why not.
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
It's the Knicks!
Screw the Knicks!
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
That's that weird voice again.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Hi!
Hi!
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
I don't want to do that.
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Why is everything different?
Bye!
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
You can pee here!
Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
Yeah!
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Y'know what, pretty good.
Yeah?
Thank you.
Here you go.
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
It's pretty clear.
That's why you broke up with me?
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
Funniest? Heckles?
That's what it says.
I'd call that excessive.
Whoa!
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
She was kidding.
Yeah.
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
It-it doesn't?
No!
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
I want you right here, right now.
Meet me in the bathroom.
I'm going to the bathroom now.
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Then be supportive like a guy.
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
That's all you're basing this on?
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Oh my God!!
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
All right buddy, way to go!
Dude, what are you doing?
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Yeah, she's...
You love her.
No, I don't.
Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
That's a good idea for a business!
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
What?!
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Really?
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Sure.
No problem.
Petrie.
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
Well it's not Sean Penn.
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Hey, gorgeous.
Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
Oh! Okay! Phew!
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
We are so gonna find them this year.
Yeah.
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Bye! Thank God
Dude, what'd you have?
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
Hey!
What's going on?
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
You are really frightening me.
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
All right, honey, time to start pushing.
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
Sure, why not?
Oh my god! Youre amazing!
So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
What?
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
All right!
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
Hummus. I got the hummus.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Well, it involved Monica.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
So what does this mean?
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
You mean you didn't get it from this?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
What are you writing?
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Hi guys!
Hey!
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
Oh, I don't know, a million?
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Why?
Told ya.
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Whoa, snowing out there?
No.
Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
Hey.
Hey.
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Oh my God!
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Settle what?
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Oh. Right.
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
Ginger.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Excuse me?
What?
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
You don't think I get up when you get up?
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Monica!
She's sleeping.
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Chandler, Chandler.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
Aww, man!
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
Any luck?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
You want me to wear your panties?
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
This one?
No.
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
I made that joke up.
Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.
Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'
What?
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
How do I look?
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
...And what did you bring?
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
Thank you.
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
How's the hired help?
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Shut up, and put my table back.
Okayyy!
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Great! Okay, here.
All right.
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
Eh..., I don't, I don't know.
What?
Rachel?
Yeah.
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Hey!
What are you guys doing up?
Dark red.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
I think I should get the chair!
How do you figure?
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Well, where's the logic in that?!
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Sounds like a date to me.
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Chandler!
Monica.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
He is?
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
An advance?
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Nah, not my game.
Well, what's it called?
Cups.
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Do we have to make the entire thing?
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
What?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Career counselor?
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Not yet.
Then, no.
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
God?
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Anything else?
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
Um, everyone?
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Yeah, well...
Hi!
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Do I look fat?
Noo.
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Hey!
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
You built a fort didn't ya?
Kinda.
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
I hate this thing!
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
What are these, like famous chickens?
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Phil.
Phil!
Hey, what's going on?
Monica's a little drunk.
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
He's a he?
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
You did?
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
So?
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Two.
I had one glass.
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
Oooooh.
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
He's coming over! He's coming over!
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Can you blame him?
Well then we still have a problem.
Yeah!
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
It's not that bad.
Chandler, Chandler.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
Hey!
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Okay, okay, what's going on?
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Oh my God!
It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
Ohh.
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
I say, punch him Joey.
Yeah! Punch him!!
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Yeah!
Oh my God!
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
From a bullet!
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Hey!!
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
You didn't just break up.
Hey, it's been like three weeks!
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
Okay.
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
Woo-hoo, geeek!
Get out!
Nooo!
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
Yeah, all right. Ooh!
Joey!
Hey!
Did you find it?
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Hey.
Oh no! What's the matter?
Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
Okay.
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Aw, I know all about Kip!
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Aw, don't do that
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
Whoa! Ohh!!
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Good morning.
Hey.
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
No, it's too soon for you guys.
Yeah, you're right about that.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Why-why would I care about that?
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
I would really love it if could do both.
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
Bye, good luck.
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
What does she mean by HH?
It means we're holding hands.
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
May I help you?
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Tell him.
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
No because it-it didn't seem important.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
No.
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
All right that's it, school is in session!
My God! Is this a gym card?
So why don't you quit?
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Monica what?
What?!
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
And a crappy New Year.
Here, here!
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Are you okay?
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Well, John McLane had plans!
What are you talking about? Bitch.
Hey Rachel?
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
Well, can you dance at all?
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
Dude.
Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
Here goes.
...Yes?
Yes, you said that.
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
Yeah?
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
Here we go again.
I-I can't handle this, you guys.
All right Pheebs, your cab's ready.
All right, let's go!
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Come on, we can't let them win!
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
So?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
What?
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Am not!
Who is that?!
My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
Hi!
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Hey-hey.
So are guys doing okay?
Yeah baby!
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
... And where's this money coming from?
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
The Ice Capades?
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Luck!
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
What?
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
Since when are you into swing music?
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
We can't do that.
Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
Hi, nice to meet you!
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
"Benefits lapsed."
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Let me see that!
All right.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
Her what?
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
So you're really okay with this?
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
You guys! You guys!
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Sure!
Chandler! Is he?
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Please.
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
OK, let's do it. What?
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
How did that happen?!!
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
...Yeah.
Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
...Yeah?
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
And she's not crazy?
Oh my God.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
I don't!
Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
I can't, I gotta go.
Almost never.
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
Who, Josh?
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Tomorrow night.
Monica, what are you doing?
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Oh, get out of here!
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak.
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
Once!!
All right, we're gonna play.
Okay. Let's bring it in.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
You told me.
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
Me too.
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
You work with robots!!
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
Bing! That's a great name.
Me too.
Bye, Chandler.
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Umm, okay.
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Why not?!
What?!
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Yeah, what's that about?
You're good. These are not.
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
Chandler.
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Hey!
Hey-hey, check out the hat!
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Ross gave it to me.
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
4:00 A.M.
So, can I get some candy?
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Hey.
Hey.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Then why would he say it?
Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Do not speak ill of the dead.
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
No way, forget it.
C'mon, she's your mom!
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Come on man, really how old?!
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
That's too much. Sorry.
So, how was the party?
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Wow! I would trade.
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
You're dying?!
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Aw.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
I know!
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
You're right.
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
What happens if you flick it?
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Hi everyone.
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
And your friend Phoebe?
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
Okay, errrr, Monica?
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
We haven't eaten yet!
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Wh-wh-why?!
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Hi.
Hey.
Uh, yeah.
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Okay, good bye!
Umm, oh, about three months.
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
No.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
You think?
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
Why, why not?
Because it's too delicious.
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Okay, let's play my game now.
Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
You remember Janice, right?
Helloo!!
Oh, my, god!
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
All right.
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Hey.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Um-hmm.
Uh-oh.
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
Well.
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
I'll get the hat.
Okay.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Well, I think so.
Hi. Where is everybody?
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Yeeeeahhhh.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah we are!
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
They have racquets don't they?!
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Oopsey, missed it!
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Like?
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Might wanna try Joseph.
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Okay, fine, fine. You don't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
We're kidding!
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
What's up?
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
But you're still my friend?
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
What's up?
Sure. Okay.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
Forget her! You enjoy this!!
What are you doing?
Are you okay?
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Uh-huh.
Do you have a point?
You know, you think I would.
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
And that doesn't scare you?
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
So have you called her yet?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
Yeah.
This couch belongs to us.
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Are you okay?
What?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
I'm back.
So, are we gonna get together or what?
Great, I'll see you then.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Wish me luck.
Good luck!
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
What? That's like insanely easy!
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Hey!
How do you feel?
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
And protected them from a tornado?
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
That was me.
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Any luck?
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
How's my Bing-a-ling?
Why are your eyes so white?
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
You're all invited to bite me!
He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
That's me.
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Hey!
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Oh, how'd that happen?
Because I'm cooler.
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Hey.
Hey!
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
They're all tourists.
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Good choice.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
What kinda change?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
What are you doing?
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Why?
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Hi.
Oh, that's attractive.
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Why?!
That game should not be played without my supervision.
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
You mean like for award shows?
Some of them.
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Okay, who wore those?
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
I so am.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Well, this all looks good.
Great.
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
No, we never do that
Okay, here comes another camera.
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
Me too!
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Of!
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
No, Janice.
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
Hmm, how about my azzz?
Hey, this is hollow.
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
That's what you should say.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Afraid to ask him?
Could not be more terrified.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
What?!
I suppose mainly sexual.
...Hm.
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Oh God, no.
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Really?
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Yeah, but don't you think....
Yeah, okay.
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Mmm.
I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
I'll help you dial.
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Bye bye Joey.
What a phony.
Sir.
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
What's this?
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Me! On my computer.
Well you sure used a large font.
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Something else I might have said?
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Keep talking.
I love you!
Bonjour, monsieur.
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
So, how was the party?
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
What?
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Name one!
What happened?!!
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
Really!
You know what I like most about him, though?
What?
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Oh God, no.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
More turkey Mr. Chandler?
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Okay, Santa!
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
Why not?
Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Know what I mean?
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
Let's do it!
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
He paid a lot of money for it.
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
And that's funny, why?
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Really?
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Are you kidding?!
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
I warned you...
Who is being loud?
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Hey! How was it?
Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
If only he were a woman.
Yeah.
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Hey. Where's Joey?
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Her what?
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Can I help you?
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
How did he do this?
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
What do we use to split it?
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
All right, I'll pick that one.
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
Hey!
Hey! You ready to go?
What?
I love you.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
How do you know that? How?
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Uh-hmm.
Oh my God! I love that!
Really?!
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
What did you do when they found out?
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
We should?
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
We stand firm at $10.
How would you like to pay?
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
Heyyyy-What?
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
I think I'm gonna cry!
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
You guys!! Come on!
What do you mean?
Hey.
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
But you're not anymore!
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
What gave me away?
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
No.
Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Thanks a lot.
No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Hey.
Hey.
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Come on man, really how old?!
Wow thanks!
Joe?
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
What?
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
What?
Cupping.
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
You still on that?
You are way off, pal.
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
That's a good story, Grandpa.
Hey
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Absolutely!
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
No, 10 is the highest.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
Yuh-huh.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
No.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Shes still here.
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
Youre kidding? She seems so...
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Then what?
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
And everybody knows this?
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Uh, Ross.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
Hi Ben!
Auntie Monica!!
I think they're very nice.
I like 'em.
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Awww. But still no.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
Oh! Wow! Hey!
Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.
That's all right, that's well, I figured....
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Hey Pheebs!
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Yeah right.
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Yes!
Yeah, he likes porn.
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
You wanted to see me?
Which is bad, because?
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Me?! Why me?
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
That is so sweet!
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
No! Why does he have to go?
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
I'll take her back tomorrow.
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
Oh?
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
What?
The ring is gone!
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
You slept with the stripper?
Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I...
Yeah-no, just that last song.
Hello.
Hello.
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Hey!
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
No.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
So, that's it?
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
Mi-mi-mii.
I've never wanted you more.
Hello.
Hey.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
You'll get one.
Oh yeah? When?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Hey...
NOW!!!!!!!!
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
Huh.
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
What are you doing?
I have no idea.
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Bumpy?
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Since when?
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
And everybody knows this?
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
Absolutely.
How come it's not mixing with the water?
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
Ok.
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Are you travelling with a child?
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Noo!!!
Yes!
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Please?
I wanted to go to the strip club!
Yeah, all right.
Hey!
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Ah, yeah!
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
This is the most special day of our lives.
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
No?
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
He should take the sack?
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
Aww. Ohh!
Put your hands together.
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Really?
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
Keep talking.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
Hey!
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Well all right, one thing happened?
Well I'm sorry.
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
No, it's-it's Andrew.
He's... new.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Ross is Batman!
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Batman has a utility belt!
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
You bug me.
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
You didn't just break up.
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
Aaaaahhh!!
There you go!
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
Its Phoebe! Hi!
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Yeah, sure.
Someone in there?
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
You win.
Well, what did you have?
Uh, wow, 700.
Not 700 exactly?
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
What is the matter with you ?!?
What?
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
You're turning into a women.
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
So is Joey around?
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!
Hey!
Hey!
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Well, I do.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Ok.
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Hey, you know about that?!
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
What?!
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
Honey, we gotta go!
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
Yes, include more people in this.
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
Oh my God, is it really that bad?
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
What's the matter with him?
I think he's stoned again.
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
No not Candy Lady.
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
Thank you.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
DANGER!!!!!
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Sure! Okay, you go first.
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
Break!
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
Let go! Let go!
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
I could be a secretary.
I could do that.
What are you playing with?
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
Yeah, me too.
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
Hey! You can't go back there!
Oh my God.
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
I will have one.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Of course, sir.
Okay.
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
What, now?
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
How's it going?
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
I know! I know!
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
Really?
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
What did you just say?
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Noo.
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Chandler, what were you thinking?
Chandler?
Yeah!
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
I am so glad you said cooks.
I know.
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
And of course, crotchless panties.
Aw, I love that.
You guys!
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Work people? Nobody told me.
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
You think I should?
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
Where's Buddy?
Buddy?
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
It's work.
And we don't work hard?
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
What do you mean?
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Oh!
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Just, just say what you feel.
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
You realize what you are don't you?
What?
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
You're straight. I get it.
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
Why not?!
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.
Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
I could be a secretary.
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
Oh, you just know.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
So was it a lot more money?
... the WENUS?
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
All right.
And could I get my ring back?
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Off?!!
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Oh yeah, come here.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
I had the same dream!
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
Wow! Yeah!
Oh-oh!
Great!
Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. Thanks Joey.
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Who needs a lease when it's family!
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Yeah.
You got it.
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
You said no right?!
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Keep talking.
Really?
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Betrothed...
...betrothed couple.
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Yeah.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Oh-I don't know.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
And they weren't looking at you before?!
Hi.
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Well, there you go.
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
Look, what do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you like her!
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Whoa! You had sex today?
Wow.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
I can't kiss anyone.
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Thank you.
Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
Chandler! Is he?
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
I understand that would be difficult.
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
It's him, not it!
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
When did I try to give you money?
Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
Are you serious?
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Dad?
I'm here!
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Your different here too. Your mean in England.
What the hell!!!
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Okay!
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Were you the ones called the cops?!
Why not?
Because we hate them.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
It's my joke.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Let's go watch it at your place.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
What?
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Quick volleyball question.
Volleyball.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Which one?
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
That's very funny. We done now?
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
Alright, whadyou do with him?
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
That oughta do it.
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
What picture?
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Kristen Lang.
Bye!
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
I was not flirting.
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Yeah, right.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Ah, the stalker.
Never mind, it's open.
Let's get out of here.
The one time they're not home.
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Is Brian...?
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
No, just give me another minute.
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
You thought about that?
Yeah.
And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
Dysprosium.
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
What?
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Old?
The young hot ball and chain.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
There's no back to this couch!
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
No.
Nooooo.
Uh-huh, yeah.
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
No!
Chandler!
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Oh my.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
That's what you say at the end of a date.
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Yeah, so?
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
I really wish that you wouldn't.
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Pheebs!!
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Hey!
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Ow!
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Again true.
And this goes for all guys?
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
Thats unbelievable.
I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Right here!
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Ohh.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Yeah, it's good.
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
What are you guys gonna do?
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
Well, how much do you think he needs?
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Well that would help the pride thing.
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
Ohh!
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
A part of him did yes.
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Hey, hey, they're runnin'
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
It isn't?
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
Hey!
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Really?
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Who was that?
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Yeah!
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Do you know anything about women?
No.
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Whoa!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Good luck!
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
What?!!
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.

You betcha!
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Emotional Knapsack?
Yeah.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
Dude, don't do that too me!
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
Sounds great.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Really?
Well, not anymore.
But we don't do that.
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
I can't believe this.
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
Rhythm?
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Rough numbers?
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Yeah I guess you're right.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Hey.
Hey, Pheebs.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Okay.
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Monica...
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
I don't want to say.
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Oh crap!
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Really?
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Water! Water! Water!
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
Ewwww!!
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Do you have any respect for your body?
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
She answered.
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Hey! Hi!
How'd he take it?
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Noo.
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
Men are unbelievable.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
Ankle.
We'll see.
I Gotcha!!
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
That had to hurt!
There you go!
You're definitely scaring here.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Yeah, me too.
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Okay.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Hi, Ross.
Hey.
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
An egg?
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
So, do we have the best friends or what?
I will go for that drink.
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Hey!
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
What's wrong with being the Bings?
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
No.
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
What did you say?
Oh, you just know.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
8!:
Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
Yes, you said that.
Chandler?
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Hi Chandler!
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
Wh-what?
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Phoebs, play with meeee.
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
Uhh, no-no thanks.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
What?
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
Okay, here is the phone bill.
Oh my God!!
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
It's not charity, Joe...
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
Chandler!
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
No, there were two.
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
...I dunno.
You don't know?!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
What?
Eldad, this is Rachel.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Y'miss it?
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
Oh my God!
What?
Nooo!!
Yes!!
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Oh?
Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
Okay.
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
What?
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
What are you doing?
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
It is???
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
Hey!
Pheebs!!
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
Well I like both eggs equally.
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
I just saw Janice.
Oh.
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Really?!
Sure! Where are the seats?
Wherever! I've got like 20!
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
We can't do this.
No! Oyster?
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
I do like that.
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Cheers!
Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Do I dare ask?
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
And the sex?
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
Is that all?
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
It's actually going to be just family.
Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Yeah.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Okay, this one I like!
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
Who jumps at loud noises!
Wow! I could've died tonight.
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Oh my God!
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
"Take good care of your Momma son."
Cut!!!!!!!!!!
Hello?
Hello, is Ross there?
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Okay.
Give me the good stuff.
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Oh my God.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
True story!
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
And thank you, for that.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Are you alright?
My God, you're choking! That better?
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
Yeah!
I like them a lot.
Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
Oh come on!!
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Even with me?
Really?
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
In the game room!
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
No!
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
Paris?
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
No.
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
Yeah!
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Oh, howd she take it?
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
I had them made special.
That's fine.
It is?
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Okay.
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Oh yeah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
It's okay, I got a plan.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Ohh!
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Hi!
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
What happened to Janine?
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Wouldn't you be?
Really?
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
What?!
Glass, sand, whatever.
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
You really think that'll work?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Okay, good luck with that.
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
In the game room!
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Did I put too much rum in here?
Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Good-bye muscles!!
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Uh-oh, it was bad?
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
It hurts my teeth.
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
1250.
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
What's in the bag?
I do!
Okay.
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Come on! Chandler!
They really were pretty, weren't they?
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
Right.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
That's okay.
And I'm cute too.
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
We are switching back, right now!
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
I don't know.
What?
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
Him? Him, Ross?
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
Absolutely, yeah!
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
Let's do it!
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
Phoebe!
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Well this one's for you.
Get out.
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
That's what they'll call us.
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
What's going on?
What is it?
That's great!
So.... I quit.
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
You seen Sandy?
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
What?
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Hey, I've been honing!
What was with the dishes?
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
Hey.
Oh. Sorry!
Me too.
Yeah?
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Yeah, you wish!
Yeah, okay. Alright.
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
How do you know that? How?
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Yeah, I understand.
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
We have got to move!
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
Hi!
Hey.
Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
All right.
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
I didn't think I was!
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
No, I will not!
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
It's happened to you?
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Absolutely.
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Hey.
Hey.
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Seven times!
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Chicken? Chicken boy!
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
Mark's a genius!
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
What am I going to do?
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
That's fine!
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
Would you please get some rest!
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
What am I going to do?
I don't know you guys.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Cigarettes?!!
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Okay that does sound like fun.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Is Joey here?
Wouldn't you be?
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Yeah I guess you're right.
I'm gonna do it.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
We're not gonna lose to girls.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Okay!
Okay!
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
No thank you.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Oh God, yeah.
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
Hey.
Hey!
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
It's this way? Sorry.
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
I can't believe it.
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
Whoa!
What?
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Well, there you go.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
I did pay for half of it.
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Way to be strong, man!
Hey!
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Hmph.
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
What are you doing?!
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
Um, is it sugarless?
Sorry, it's not.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
OK, here goes.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
Never!
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Ohhh, here it comes.
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
Really?!
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
No, I ah, I didn't do them.
Oh, you forgot?
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
Doug!!
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Phoebe is, making people.
Everybody's doing stuff!
We could climb Mt. Everest!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
You do?!
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
What did you say?
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Keep going.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.
Shes still here.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Youre kidding? She seems so...
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Okay, I freaked out a little.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Yes.
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
So what's going on with you?
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
So the light went out in my refrigerator...
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Dysprosium.
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Hey, here she comes.
Hey.
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
Come on, don't do this.
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
That is so funny. Let me see that.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
All right, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.
Oh my god.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Ohhh!
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Ross, sweetheart!
Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
It's not that bad.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
No, I'm still married.
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
I do not have baby fever!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
That's him.
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
Come on.
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
Are you sure this time?
Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's.
There is no alley behind Macy's.
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Okay sure!
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
So what. I say, punch him.
Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
What?
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
I'm crying here!!
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
Wow!
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Hey, the fight's starting!
Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Fight's over!
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
It's not that bad.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
I got something for her. It's a book!
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
See, I would never snap at you like that.
Continue.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
I'm not arguing with that.
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
What do ya say? What do ya say?
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Are you serious?
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Hey.
Sure, neighbor come on in.
So, is Janine around?
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
Yeah.
Cool.
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Games and stuff.
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
What are you doing?
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Right here!
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Okay.
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Well, if you think it will help.
You should! How is she?
Ohhh!!
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
What?
I don't want to move again!
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
That's what you say at the end of a date.
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
Well, they always called.
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Hey!
What are you up too?
Yeah, Big Brother.
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
So have you called her yet?
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Yeah! She's right in there!
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
Hi, oh hi.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Really? I've heard better.
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Youre kidding? She seems so...
Thats unbelievable.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Well yeah.
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
It doesn't say that in the script.
It does in mine!
You bug me.
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
You probably want us to move in together?
It doesn't scare me!
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
How about receiving?
Yes!
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
No, not us... Us!
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
You got all that from the back of her head?
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
I don't know.
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Great!
Now, have you told anyone else?
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
You know what the. . .
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
Hey guys.
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
What?!
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
Did that!
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
But...
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
How is that the silver lining?
You have to really wanna see it.
No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Oh!!
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
Happy for you.
No, happy for you!
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Chandler?
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Why?
She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
Listen to me!!
Juice, I need...
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
Scared? Happy?
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
I know! I can't wait!
Were you're parents happy, or something?
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Well what happened at dinner?
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
What?
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
We've got a box.
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Phoebe, woo!
Okay, woo! Hi.
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Mine!
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
Hey.
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
Hey!
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
Chandler.
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.
It's not that bad.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
What?!
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
You promised you would break up with her!
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
My God! What happened to you?
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
What?!
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
Hello darlings.
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Yeah, you wish!
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Well, it involved Monica.
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
What was the dream about?
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Why would I be mad?
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
Okay.
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
What?
Let me see that! Oh man!
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Yeah, where the hell is he?
How's this?
Eeeee!
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Chandler, Chandler.
Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
I think she's OK.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
No way!
It's true.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Monica? You're Mom.
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Hey!
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Guys?
Over here.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
What?! Ow!
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
He took my joke, he took it.
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
That's a good idea.
Yeah!
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Well what is it?!
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
How? How is your fault?
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
Huh?
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Sorry Phoebe.
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
No, no, ACC-cept that.
Oh.
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
How sad are we?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
Right.
Hi.
Hello.
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Oh.
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Sure!
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
No.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
Oh My God.
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
You're right, you're right, it is.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
No.
You really think so?
Yeah. I really do.
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
I can't believe this Chandler!
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
Ah-ha!
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
No, we only went out once.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
I don't know you guys.
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Let go! Let go!
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
Ow!!
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
....Are we still talking about sex?
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Oh, right, right, shut up.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
Here.
The receipt.
I don't know.
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
It's a pretty cool tux.
We should really learn how to play the real way.
I like our way. Oh! Chess!
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Wait, we can't do this.
Why?
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Really?
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Yeah?
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
What's this?
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
What, what is that?
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Hi!
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
It doesn't scare me!
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Honey, this will help.
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Ohh, so?
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Hey!
Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
See, now it's weird again.
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Okay!
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Saw your head. Saw your head.
What is it?
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
The balloon?
I can't, I gotta go.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
Oh yay!
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
Hey-hey!
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Can't we just use a pen?
No, Amish boy.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Really?
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Because it's too delicious.
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Oh, I'm sorry what?
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Really?
No freakshow, she's fictional.
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Will you get us better gifts?
Fine!
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Oh John! Great!
Here he is.
Wow! I would trade.
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
You're actually going through with this?
You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
Really?!
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
Yeah!
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
Ohh...
That sounds perfect!
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
That game should not be played without my supervision.
What's in the bag?
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
What?! Anything! Anything!
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
God, he's good.
If only he were a woman.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Yeah?
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
No.
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
You're a little high maintenance.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
I'm off the list.
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
I talked to Janice.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
What do you mean?
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
So why don't you quit?
Who is Maria?
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Yes, and grumpy.
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
I love you too.
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
What?!
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
That's easy, baggage claim.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
Oh.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
Hi.
Hi.
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Really?
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh my God. He threw up?
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
No.
Then you are neither of your parents!
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
Oh my God.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
You OK?
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.
Oh.
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Who said anything about Christmas?
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Uh-huh.
Morning.
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
Oh, that's too bad.
I'll survive.
What if we have to pee?
I'll cancel the sodas.
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Why, nobody good?
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Hey, this is so unfair!
Oh, why is it unfair?
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Well, I-I could live without it.
I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
She is now.
What are you saying?
How? How is your fault?
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
Really?
Chandler!
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Oh! Oh!
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
Ohhhhh!
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Five more and I'll flash you.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
You said...
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Ohh.
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
You know what the. . .
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
You were gonna propose?
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Have you been here all night?
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
We want candy! We want candy now!
Candy Lady?
No not Candy Lady.
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
You must stop!
That only took me an hour.
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
What?
Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
Yeah, o-okay.
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
That's a good idea for a business!
That-that is a good trick.
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
Thank you.
That's fine.
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
I'll take that.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Okay.
Wow!
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
I can't do that.
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Ohhh, yeah, me too.
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Come on Joey!!!
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
Chandler?
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
I do.
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Oh my God.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Yes.
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Really?
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Do you?
Don't you have to pee?
'S'why I'm dancing...
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Oh my God.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Yes.
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
What? Why, why would...
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
We have good news, look whose back!
Hi!
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
Oh, no...
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Light still out?
Yeah.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
What else did you think about?
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Sure you do.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
I think you're better than you think you are.
Really? Okay, so...
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
Am I naked again?!
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
I am pretending.
Well then, do it better!
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Bye, Pheebs.
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
Down at the docks again?
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Here's my binoculars.
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Uh huh. Why is that?
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Hey!
Please tell me you got the message!
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Yeah! Oh my God!
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
The bigger half.
That's so sweet.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
Again?
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
Well?
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
