As in my grandmother.
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
We agreed on Minnie.

Umm.
Yep.

But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Then change it back!
I'm sorry I... It's just there's no real spark.

Your territory, huh?

Nooo!!
Oh yeah, I totally agree.

Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
Nora!
Hi...dad.
Hi Mr....Bing.
Charles.
It-it's so great to see you both here.
Normal.
Are you talking about having sex?
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Nope! That never happened to me!
Nothing?
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
I have to get back to...
O-kay!
Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Yeah.
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...
Oh my God!
OH.....MY.....GOD!!
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
OH.....MY.....GOD!!
Oh my God!
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
OH...MY...GAWD!!
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Hmm.
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Ohh, Nothing.
OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
Lucky bastard! Janice.
How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
Obviously.
Umm...
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Oh-no-no-no-no....
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
Just one drink?!
So, where do you want to go?
Oh-no.
But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
Well I-I think your wrong.
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
Fortunately, I won't. And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Is it on?
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Ohhhh!
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Joey! You didn't even know her!
Ah whatever!
Ohhhhh!
You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Ohhhhhh!
Well, what happened?
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Oh my God!
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Okayyy!
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Shut up, and put my table back.
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Oooh!
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
W-wait. What is that?
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Ooohhh.
Zoo dollars?
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
I know.
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
Ooooohhh.
Who's Rick?
My husband.
Oh, so you're divorced?
No.
Oooooo....
Was it...?
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
"Ooo," what?
Uma Thurman.
Op.
Tomatoes are squishing.
Okay.
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Yeah.
Or?
So what are you saying? It's now or never?
No. I'm saying it's now.
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
Ow!!
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
Watch the thorns!
What?
Beth is really, really sick.
Oww!!
Oh God!
Bing!

Remoray!
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
Not so fast Wesley!
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!
Oh! Thank God!
Roll-roll!!
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Go! Come on! Roll!
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
What did you just say?
Rrrreally.
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
...Now? Now?
SURPRISE!!!
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Alright, what have we learned so far?
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Was that the cake?
Salad.
Hey! What's going on?
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
Bread. Aren't you a chef?
Saltines?
Did you pick out the vowels?
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
Scotch.
I think I need a drink.
Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
Neat.
See.
Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
She.
Dr. Oberman.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
Yes, and she's very supportive.
Shhh.
...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Shhhh!
Oh, oh! It's on again!
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Si.
Oh!
Yeah! Se vice?

Getting so good at that!

Okay. I can do that.
Okay.
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
Taxi.
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
Bye you.
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
Texas?
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
Wow! Thanks!
Thing?
Ross!
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Thing, yes. Thing.
Ah, you... have the sex?
This?
You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
Uh-huh.
Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...
Three.
One.
Two.
That's kinda nice.
Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
Two.
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Uh--
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
Uh-oh!
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Joey?!
Hi Ross.
Uh-oh...
Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
How-how did that happen?
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
Uh.
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
No way!
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Uhh-huh.
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Oh, Kim, Hi.
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
I didn't read it.
Uhh....
Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Umm...
Uh, you guys?
How did you know we were here?
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
Obviously.
Waitressing?
C'mon, this is us.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
We?
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
Well I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh! I'm getting all misty here! You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
Well....
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Goodnight.
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
Wh..
One more chance Ursula, please?
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
What's...
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
How do ya do.
Umm, well, he's...
He's doin' some thinkin'!
What.
Hang on.
Hello, excuse me.
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
I'm talkin'!
What?!!
Guys, what's going on?
Phoebe's a porn star!
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Oh my God!
When?
No! No! Not, Paris.
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
I don't know exactly.
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
Where?
Sorry, what?
It's the Gellers!
Well there's one and there's another .
Lovely to meet you.
Who?!
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
In Human Resources!!!!!!
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
Whoa.
Y'know I have dinner plans!!
Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Whoooaa!
Alright, somebody.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
That's my sister.
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Wine?
Oh look, a low budget puppet show.
It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
Please.
Oh, I spilled some.
Woah!
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
Hi you guys.
Woo-hooooo!!!!
Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
Wooooo!!!!
Wooooo!!!!
Woo-hooooo!!!!
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Wow!!
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Hey, everybody!
Wh-haa-haa! Look what 'cha did!
You wanna touch it?
Y!
L!
Gimme a 'Y!'
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Are you all right?
Yeah-yeah.
Really?
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
Yes...
No no no. Talk... dirty.
Wha... what, here?
Ah....
Say something..... hot.
Yo!!
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Oh sure. Vince?!
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
So, what's up?
Yuh.
...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
Zelner.
Fair enough.
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
I guess.
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
You do?
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
Of course I do.
You're right.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
So, can you trust me?
No.
Hey! Hi!
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
How'd he take it?
Pretty well, actually...
Hi! Hey!
Thank God you're pretty.
Hey!
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
All right.
You kids ready?
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
Oh, ah, you don't need that.
I don't know.
The receipt.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
Oh, yeah!
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
Isn't Ben in this?
That commercial always makes me so sad.
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
Okay. Okay.
So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
Nice!
Well, you certainly own that room.
I'm kidding.
We get high.
Oh, me too.
Oh, me too.
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Do you?
Oh, I knew you'd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?
Do I?
Yeah, I do, yeah.
Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!
It's me!
Guess who?
Department of Sanitation?
Oh! Ah. Aw!
What?
I know that.
Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Hey!
Oh, thanks.
Are you serious?
Uh-huh, yeah!
What are you doing?
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
I promise.
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
Promise me you'll be careful.
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Yeah.
Oh yeah!
Yeah! Yes!
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. Okay, somebody call it this time.
Tails!
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
It's us.
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
Hello.
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
You think?
He is right, isn't he?
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
Oh-no, he's right.
Hi.
Excuse me.
I hate actors.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
Ahhhh.
Uh, is your name Chandler?
That's okay.
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
You sure?
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
Okay, okay.
You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? You want a piece of me?
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
What was all that about?
You are!
Like it would help.
You are so bad!
You are!
You are!
Oh Joey!
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
That's right!
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Oh no!
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
I do know.
Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
Y'know, he hums when he pees!
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
We're so sorry.
That's fine.
I had them made special.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
It is?
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Oh God.
You'll see.
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
I'm kidding!
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
Gotcha.
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
Hey, Joey.
No, but he's...
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Where are they? Where are they?
That's great!
What is it?
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
So.... I quit.
Why?
Hi. Hi.
Chandler?
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
What are you doing here?
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
You did!
He started it!
No, you started it.
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
But...
Yeah. Oh.
Nothing.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
What's wrong?
I just remembered, I have to do something.
The what?
Here, we are.
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
No, I think it's cute.
I'm sorry?
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
How long do cats live?
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
That's great.
Five oh dollars.
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
What? Oh!
Hey!
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Sorry man.
Here's your scone.
Hey what?
I should just be happy to be near you.
Hey I-
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
Hey Joey.
Phoebe...
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
No, I just thought it was cute.
Hey, Rachel.
Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
Hi!
What's up? You're voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
Yeah, thanks.
You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
Not me.
I don't need any toner.
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
May I ask why?
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
Uh, okay.
Okay.
So how's it goin' with Joey?
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
I like Ross.
Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so.
Neither of us like Ross!
Ohhh! Kids!
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
Oh, it's you.
Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay.
Wait!
Yeah. What?!
Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31.
Hey, Chandler.
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Hey, Lowell.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Oh, alright.
Oh, well that's not so crazy.
I'm just easing you in.
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Oh, really.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
Well, I was having a conversation.
I am?
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Sure, why not?
Oh my god! Youre amazing!
I am?!
What?
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
Yeah!
I can't believe it!
I can't!!
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
Why not?!
I'm in my boss's car!
She's here.
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
Um, yeah I guess that's me.
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
Hey Ross!
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
Hi.
What's not funny?
No, Joey!
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
John Glenn is here?!
Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...
Wait! Hold on! Hi!
No, no!
What?!
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
What are you crazy?!
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
Hey Rachel.
Joey.
Erin.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
What's wrong?
No! No!
No.
'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
Thank you!
Hey!
Hey! Happy birthday.
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
No he didn't.
I got it!
Looks like it.
Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at...
Okay.
Susan! Hi!
I'm OK
I don't think so.
Oh, I do. How you doin?
What?!?!
What?
I'm Tilly.
Thanks.
Oh, oh, c'mon in.
Oh.
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
I'm pregnant.
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
Why- why are you here, Carol?
Pregnant?!
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Okay, yeah!
Yeah!
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Umm, hi!
Hi.
No, please.
Hi.
You mind if I...
So uh, what are you in for?
I talk in my sleep.
Hey, Chandler!
Where's Mary-Angela?
She's right in there.
I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
Bummer.
What's that?
No. No. I don't think so.
Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
That's-that's my nubbin.
What's a nubbin?
Y'know what?
Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
Thank you! You're great!
What?
I feel great. In fact! What?
Hey Chandler.
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
Hey Gar!
Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, OK.
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
This is Rachel.
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
It's a lovely apartment.
Hey, Phoebe.
You're so pretty.
Hi!
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
My what?
I'd better get back to my desk.
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Are you serious?
Hi, Joey.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
My god, Angela.
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Oh, Jack.
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
Alright.
Oh, Judy. Oh, Judy.
Oh, ohhhhh.
Oh, really?
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Oh, sorry!
Oh great!
So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
Oh that's okay.
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
Oh! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
Hockey! Hockey! Hockey.
Rachel?
You stop!
No you stop!
No, you stop!
Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
Oh Drake.
And you're no friend to those with noses.
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
Joey, right?
You're in this picture?
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
Yeah.
Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I feel great. In fact! What?
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
There it is.
What is going on?
Yeah, sure.
I need something sweet.
Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Monica your remote doesn't work.
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Hey! Rachel!
Bread. Aren't you a chef?
Oh.
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Oh! Oh!
No-o-o!!
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
You got it.
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Okay.
G'bye, everybody.
Well thanks.
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
Not really.
What one?
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
Hey guys.
I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
Do you want my pickle?
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Well, he's very charming.
Hi, Ross.
You're in!
Aw, right.
Hey.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Tell me.
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
We've got a problem.
I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
Is it bad?
Come on!
May I see it?
Um, no.
But, okay.
I'm not on the list!
Come on.
Oh come on, I already went.
You did not go!
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
Step back.
It's for me.
All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
Oh. Okay, bye.
So what are you gonna do?
Hey, Monica!
What for?
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
You had sex, didn't you?
Oh really?
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
No, nothing.
Yeah.
Nothing at all?
Oh. Oh.
I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
It's nice.
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Excuse me?
And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
Thank you.
Yeah, really.
Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
Really?!
What?
Suddenly, I very aware that I'm naked.
Okay. Bye.
I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
I-I think we have too.
Bye. Are you still out there?
No.
Oh, god.
But they're not here yet!
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
Ok, got the vent open.
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Oh, hi.
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
Bob here.
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.
Okay, then.
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
Okay.
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
No. Why?
Nice to meet you Mac!
This is like the temporary robot, right?
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.
Hey Phoebe.
Okay, my next song's called Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
Hey Rachel!
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
Hi!
Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he...
Come in.
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Okay, I'm totally cool!
Hey Jessica.
Hey Jess.
Well, people!
No, no, no. What was that?
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
People, people, people.
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
Hi Joey.
Totally.
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Hey! How you doin'?
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
I'm Margha.
I'm Dutch.
Hi-hi, I'm Joey.
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
You can't.
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
How come? Everybody else does.
What is that?
Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Umm, no.
Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
When, when did-how, how did you...
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
Hey Joey!
Hey!
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
Erin! Still here!
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
After you.
Yeah.
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God!
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
It's about you.
Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
Um, not even a little bit.
Oh, okay then.
I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
Oh Fonzie.
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Oh please!
You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
Hi Ross.
Uh-oh!
Joey?!
I was just getting him to like you.
Joey?! Joey!!
Good one.
Come on!
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Sure. What?
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Well, first it's not a purse.
Okay, anytime.
Phoebe. Hi.
No.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
No. Have you seen David?
I gotta go.
Not after this!
Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
God! Ross!
God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
Hi Rachel.
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Oh hi!
Wow, love your new nose!
Sure. Okay.
What's up?
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
Yeah! Yes!
I know.
The test is ready.
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. Okay, somebody call it this time.
Oh yeah!
No! Why?
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
It was.
Ohh, it's a bit small.
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Those were like the best seats ever.
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
You OK?
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
You have?
Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
You haven't?
Well, this is none of my business.
I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
Oh man!!
No, but it did! Didn't it?!
Yeah!
I know!
I'll get it.
Just us.
I hope she throws up on you.
So...
Oh, what a crappy night!
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Hey Chandler?
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Yeah?
Would you.......Would you hug me?
I'll see you.
Me too.
Okay.
Bye.
Or I'll hear you.
And for you?
And what will that be on the side of?
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Yeah, whatever.
Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.
Oh, mine's December...
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Hi, Monica.
Oh, Chandler, sorry.
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Ok, well, this was very special.
Rach, come see who's out here!
No thanks.
Yeah, I forget which ones.
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
Thank you. What a bitch.
Hey, Rach!
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Hey, Sophie!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
Really?
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
Hi.
Oh, that's attractive.
Oh. Thanks.
That I was not expecting.
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
You're welcome.
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.
Alright. Cab driver number two?
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Things change, roll with em.
No, Frank.
No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
Yeah, refrigerator college.
Oh my God!
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Hey!
Oh! It's on! It's on!
There we go little fella.
What's up?
Yeah?
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Sure. Okay.
Call me.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
Huh? What?
For what?
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
It's my joke.
I'll do it.
Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Okay, absolutely!
And Action!
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
Scene 5, take 1.
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
Me too.
Bing! That's a great name.
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Bye, Chandler.
So ah, what's wrong with him?
Oh, excellent.
G'night.
Here. Y'know, just in case.
What kind of karate is that?
No kind. He just makes it up.
No, I'm sorry.
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
You have me!
So what do you want?
You.
Nono, just you.
Whaddyou mean?
Oh, me too.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so...
Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda...
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
Like this.
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
What do you mean?
That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
Uh-huh.
You are now.
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Hey guy!
My chair heels itself.
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
Hey guys!
Is that your card?
Yes.
Hi!
Hi there!
I'm 16.
Ohh!
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
See you in 2003.
You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.

Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!

I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
Chandler.
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.
I'm Irish.
1 minute 50 seconds.
Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
And the Irish guy wins the joke!

You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Scott.
I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real!
Wow, Rhonda.

I'm ready!
I know.
Yeah.
You sure?
Uh-huh!
I'm talkin'!
What.
Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
Alright, fine. I'll call you back.
It's not here.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
How could I have left them in the copy room?
What?! Why?
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
Hi Chandler!
Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
Oh, Chandler.

Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Hi Monica.
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
Hi Phoebe.
I was thinkin' about it.
OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe

But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
Hi Rachel!
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
Happy Thanksgiving!

That's weird.
But, he told me over the phone.
He told me in person.
Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh!

Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know?
Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
What happened?
Oh Hans.
Is all this true?
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.

Well, thanks for the books.

So, you'd hire me, right?
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Huh? What?
Like what?
Yay!
Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
I love that idea!
Get out.
Yeah, right.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Well I'm sorry.
Well all right, one thing happened?
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
Yeah. Frank.
How do you know Frank?
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
Yeah. What?
Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
No problem.
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
Sure.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Petrie.
Ross! Wait!
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about...
You suck!!
You were right.
Hey.
And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.
Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Uh, yes.
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
So what happened?
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
Not to me.
Yeah.
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Yeah, fair enough.
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
Hey Pheebs!
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Surprise! Look who's back!
Hey!
Call security. Pheebs, didn't you get fired?
Hello, Rachel.
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
No. No!
Well, not at first.
What is she doing here?
Not her.
That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
So, um, will you bring the truck?
All right!
Yeah we do!
Ohh, well you got 'em.
Just give us our apartment back!
Boy! I didn't see that coming!
That's all!
Oh that's so great!
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Ohhhh!! ...What? What?
That's not all.
Good morning.
Really?
Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
Hi!
Hey.
Good for you.
So, Monica, what do you do?
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
This hummus is great.
No kidding.
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Where do you work?
I heard that.
Where did you hear it from before?
Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Pheebs.
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
Hey.
How's it going?
Right! Okay.
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
Our mom.
Do you have my birth certificate?
No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
Hi! Hello!
All right then. Bye.
Hello, people who do not live here.
I gave you a key for emergencies!
We were out of Doritos.
Hello Joey.
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.
Really?
Hey, Felicity.
Umm, I thought about you all day.
This does.
Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
You have the power to do that?
Shut it down.
Hey.
You are?
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Yeah!
Why?
You didn't!
I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy.
Hello!
You dog!
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
You haven't?
Really?!
Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
You have?
Well, this is none of my business.
You suck!!
Ross! Wait!
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about...
What?!
Okay, break-up's still on!
Sorry, what?
Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
It's the Gellers!
Where?
Now go!
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
But...
Thanks a lot.
See what you did.
Oh, I got it.
Good luck.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
Whoa, you are very beautiful.
Hello, Chandler.
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
Margha.
Why not?
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
Oh, ah, you don't need that.
The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Here you go.
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
Thank you.
Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
That was me.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Oh, en chante.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
I can't say.
I really can't say.
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
What is it?
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
What's going on?
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
That's great!
Yeah, me too.
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
I'll have coffee.
Yeah, make that three.
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
I'll be there.
Great. Great.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
Mr. Geller.
Nice save.
Mrs. Bing.
Hey.
You mean that?
See ya.
Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel?

Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
That's a plane!
I'm the student.
Oh hi!
Hi!
Isn't she cute? No!
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
It's Alan.
What bank is this?
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
Chandler! He's here!
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
It's Erica.
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Hello.
Ah, the stalker.
Never mind, it's open.
It's okay...
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Two years.
What's wrong?
Why don't you try to do-

Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Ohh. Hi!
Everyone, this is Julie.
Julie.
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
And bus.
And cut!
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
I like Ben.
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
How 'bout Ben?
Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
We uh, we just cooked it up.
It was you?
Yes.
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
Oh, Liam.
Oh my God. I think you're right.
Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
We were playing rugby.
Oh, jeez.
What about the duck?
Well the duck can swim.
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
Way to go, Phoebe!
Oh, my.
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
Oh, ohhhhh.
Oh, Jack.
Oh, Judy. Oh, Judy.
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
And there you go!
Chandler!!
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Yes! Phoebe.
Yes.
Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
That's my first name.
Right, okay, then no.
Okay, Santa!
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Merry Christmas!
Now I do.
Right.
Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
We did?
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
Yeah, right.

A lot of other gas smells...
Oh the humanity.

Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
Hello. Hello.
Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?
Yeah, welcome.
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.

Who the hell is Jordie?
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
Monica! Chandler!

Some of your old stuff.
No way!
Um... Ross?
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Oh, Rachel.
No, I'm not.
Oh, don't worry about it.
No, really you're gonna freeze.
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Some day, maybe.
You're strict.
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
It's for their own good.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
Thanks Phoebe!
No. No.
Okay! All clear!
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Everything okay in there?
How are you?
Oh, hi.
This is everybody. This is Ross.
Hey.
Chandler.
Stop it!
Hit me!
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Please stop it!
You never know.
I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.
Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
Ok, Phoebe.
Yeah, leave!
Oh yeah, aww!
Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
Yeah, get out! Now!
Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
Yeah, well..
So, how ya doin?
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
Be right there. Be back in a sec.
No, it's you!
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Please.
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
We're ok.
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
Alright.
Ok so, can I have my hat back?
The receipt.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
Here.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
I don't know.
I guess so.
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
Oh, is he hungry already?
You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
I gotta get one, too.
What's with you?
No actually, I was just going for colorful.
What's with this guy?
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
What just happened?
Rachel stop!
What?
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
You're so bad!
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
All right!!
Okay, one...two...
So we are going on two?
Oh, good job Joe.
Wow, it's big!
What about it?
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
Hi, did you order some bananas?
Gimme back my monkey.
I don't have a monkey.
Bye guys.
Yeah, let's go.
Okay. See you guys later.
Yeah, see ya.
Hey, thank you so much.
Hi Frank.
You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Hi, Mrs. Knight.
Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
Hi honey.
Hi.
Hey.
Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
What?
It's Pam.
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Aw-awww!
It's clean.
It's a curling iron.
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
Yeah, well, it feels different.
It's dry.
It's dry.
It's clean.
Yeah, well, it feels different.
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
It's laminated!
I'm not on the list!
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
Y'know it's ironic...
It's perfect.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
Well then we'll get wet.
It's textbook.
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
It's yours!
Really?!
It's kinda slutty.
Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut.
Me too.
Oh I know!!
"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"/Happy holidays, everybody!
Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch...
And Rog.
Hello?

Are you sure?
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Mr. Tribbiani.
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Oh hi!
Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
It isn't.
Oh, that is so not true.
Oh, it is.
It is.
Isn't!
Are you Chandler?
Oh look at you! So handsome!
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Are you Joey?
Huh. This is nice.
Could ya?
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
You want me to wear your panties?
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.
But Phoebe...
Hi! What's going on?
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just-that was my puppy.
Bye Phoebe.
I-I do though.
I do too.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
Good luck.
Ohh, nice choice.
Yeah.
Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars.
Shut the door! Shut the door!!
Hey pal.
Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
Hey you guys!
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!

Hey!
Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
Yeah, but this is
I can't do that!
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
She didn't.
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Thank you Phoebe.
I know.
Hey!
C'mon in.
Ross? That opens my cervix.
Barry?
Are you sure?
Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
I'll survive.
No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
Oh, that's too bad.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
What if we have to pee?
Not bad.
Hey.
How are you holding up?
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
Thanks.
Yeah. Thank you.
No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
We'll talk later.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Shut up, and put my table back.
A little.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
Yeah?
How you doin'?
I just hope...
I know, it's horrible isn't it?
Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
You can let some of them go by!
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
So, all right.
Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
Oh.
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.

Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.

Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Hey!
My husband.
Who's Rick?
Who's Rick?
Ooooohhh.
Oh, so you're divorced?
I can do that.
Great!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Fight.
Ohh great.
Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
Can I, can I help you with something?
Well, I don't know. Are you a masseur?
Ohh, I'm sorry.
Of course!
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh...
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
What?! Anything! Anything!
Not really.
Well thanks.
Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
Which one?
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
...The second guy.
Well, call me if you change your mind.
No! I did!
You grow up.
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Of course! It's her favorite.
What contracts?
If this is your idea of sexy talk?
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Like what?
What people?
They have parasites?
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
People! People say it! Come here!
So oysters, huh?
What woman?!
Who's party is it?
A woman's
Chelsea.
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
Wasn't it?
It was, wasn't it?
The food there was, was great.
So take care.
You too.
Take care.
Pleasure.
It was nice to meet you.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
You like that do ya?
Wow! Thanks!
Texas?
That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
Yeah, it was.
...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
Oh, this is so great.
All right then. Bye.
Hello, people who do not live here.
Yeah, we are.
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
Actually, no, we're not.
No, we're not.
Yeah, we are.
Good choice.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Thanks.
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Good evening.
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Excuse me...
Ahh-hahaha!
Ha!
All of them.
Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
Oh yeah, so you know D?
Yeah.
He's sleeping.
Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Where's Ben?
Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
Got it!
That's kinda sad.
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
Let's roll!
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
I'm already here.
Yes, we were just...
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?

Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
I'm so sorry!

Sorry!
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
Um, leave.
I just remembered, I have to do something.
Oh. What?
Wait, wait, wait!
So I guess you all saw it.

So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Okay, anytime.

Hello, sweetheart.

Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Yeah, it's not mine.
I love your car.
Of course.
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Oh. Then, no.
Did I put too much rum in here?
No, you don't.
I got it.
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
Why?
Hey, mate.
Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross.

Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
Hey, waiter.

No.
Yeah?
Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
Well yeah!!
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
OH...MY...GOD!!
Are you gonna be okay?
Me too!
I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
You're dying?!
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
You're next!!
Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Daddy!
Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
I see the head.
Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing.
Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
Yes, it has a head!
All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
Get out!
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Well...
What took you so long?
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Oh, you know what?
A sandwich?
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
What?
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
I'm a dancer.
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Talk to me.
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
No no no. Talk... dirty.
Hey! Sugar-O's!
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
Hi, Alan.
Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
Hi.

Okay, I heard that.

Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
That's my monkey.

That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
Dr. Geller!
Ohh that's so sweet!
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
Burt!
So did you sleep well last night?
Just ah...
Oh Rachel, uhh...
What?
Excuse me?
Here let me...
I did not!
Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
You put these on my desk!
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
I missed this.
He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice.
Yeah.
Me too.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
Shut up!
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
I'm gonna try.
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
You're welcome.
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
No I didn't.
Nice to meet you Joey.
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
I think you did.
I think I lost. Three times.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
With such a sad history.
Okay, I love you.
Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
I love you.
I love you, love you.
Hi. I'm Monica.
It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
She's your partner.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Monana?
Huh. Yeah?
What do you think?
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
Isn't there?
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
I felt it!
Keep singing! Keep singing!
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Nope, not that one.
Which guy?
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
Yes sir.
But like how?
Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
Why?!
Oh, you forgot?
Bing! You got those numbers for me?
No, I ah, I didn't do them.
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
Thank you sweetheart.
No!
Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
I don't think so.
How you doin'?
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
There's more alcohol, right?
Ok.
You did a good thing today.
Sign here.
Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. You Miss Geller?
Okay.
Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
We should?
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
Who are you?
I could play the oboe!
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
Hi, I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.
I'm Chandler's new roommate.
Oh my god.
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
And bus.
The screaming guy?
And the spitting?
I do Raquel.
Hey, hey Ross.
Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
So, uh, he's back.
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
Yeah. All right.
No thanks.
Hombre?
You were saying?
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
Behind you?
Oh my God!
Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Of course!
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
No-no-Really?!
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh...
Ohh, I'm sorry.
No I'm not.
Hey!
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
We're still rolling!
You're making one right now!
Good morning!
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
I sure did!
Hey Danny.
Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
Hey guys.
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Thanks, Mon.
Hey Pete.
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
Hi, how ya doing?
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Right, and...
What? Alright, what about my two?
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
Uh sure.
All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?
Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
Okay.
Action!
Who is it?
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
It's Phoebe.
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
Well, of course.
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Thanks, Mon.
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Monica!!!
One second.
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
I can't do that.
Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.
Yes, I am.
Hey, it's everybody.
Janice, you're--
Is it--?
Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
July. Umm,
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
I want you Drake.
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
We, we just wanna see the end.
I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.
What?
Here we go.
What?!
A small puff of air, now come on!
All right.
1...2...3!
I'm all done.
Yeah-No!!
Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that...hot dog.
Thank God.
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Don't do that.
Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Don't do that.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Yes I did.
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Ohh. Ooh!
Hey!
We're so sorry.
I do know.
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
About what?
Hi.
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
Y'know, about what happened with us.
Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
I sure did!
Good morning!
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
Oh, excuse me.
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
You're that stupid.
Mmm hmmm.
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
I am. I'm that stupid.
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Hello darling.
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Oh my God.
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
Hi Kim.
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Hi Ralph.
Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
Hi Ralph.
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Hi Kim.
Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
Mrs. Geller?
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Not just restaurants, from our house.
She looks so small.
I know.
Nice hat.
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Thanks.
We should do something. Whistle.
Nice shot.
Oopsey, missed it!
I got it!
I got it!!
Long!
Susan! Hi!
I got it!
Okay.
Hey!
Thank you so much for coming.
Oh, you're welcome.
So you like it?
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
Did you just smell my hair?
Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
Uh, ow.
Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
I'll never forget you.
Uh, plate?
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Plate! Yes, plate.
Plate. Plate. Plate.
Yeah, you're funny.
That's a good one.
Yeah? You like that one?
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Can I do it to you?
Uh, you guys?
Here I am!
Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth's here! Who are you talking to?
How did you know we were here?
Umm...
Oh, no thanks.
Hi!
Care for a cherry?
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
You okay? You all right?
It's my sister.
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
I got you...these.
What?
What... did you get me there?
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
I don't have anything.
Oh, she's gonna love that!
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
Hey listen man, about the stripper...
Yeah?
Is Brian...?
What? He's cute!
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Are you sure?
She what?!
She's dead.
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
Listen to me!
Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
Oh no-no-no, you don't understand...
Oh yeah, yeah.
I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
Your license?
Can I see your license please?
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
That's Hanson.
Oh! Oh, God!
Chandler, what are you doing?
Hey. Whaddya doing?
What is this?!
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
She what?!
Yeah, yeah. Why?
Lilly's dead.
She's dead.
Are you sure?
Oh my God!!
Why are your eyes so white?
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
All right!
How did you know?
I saw Richard.
Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Oh.
So, how are you doing?
Chandler Bing?
Uh, is your name Chandler?
Uh, yes, yes it is.
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
Hello everybody!
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Hi!
Hi!
That's my job!
He touched my fanny.
No, she touched mine first!
So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you?
Ewww!!!
Uh-huh, yeah.
Nooooo.
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
So you like it?
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
Oh, you're welcome.
Oh. Thank you.
Well, that' me. Here, have this. I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
That's no problem.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Let's go!!
Hey! Don't be a baby!
Well I...
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Thank goodness.
Yes.
I'm Rachel Green.
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Do I know you?
Excuse me?
It's me, Joey!
Joey!
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Ugh. Ross!
I know!
Bye!!!
Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
Ahh, nooo!!
No you stop!
Were you this cute in high school?
Oh stop.
No, you stop!
You stop!
As were you.
Well have we finished the scene?
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
So I got your car, it's right outside.
Why? Are we done for the day?
Hey, you listen.
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
No, no, let me finish.
No, let me finish.
Ross, sweetheart!
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Isn't it a beautiful wedding?!
Here's the thing.
You look very pretty today.
Thanks! Okay.
Yeah?
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Two years.
It's okay...
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
I'm not all right.
Game!
Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. Are you all right sweethart?
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
I think we're here.
Oh, I didn't, I didn't know that.
Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh...
Oh! Yeah.
Yeah.
What's different?
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
What?
Nothing.
Oh, maybe that's it.
But were fine.
Its a little complicated.
A little.
Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch.
And to you too, Helen.
Come on in.
Hi Rachel!
Hi!
It's really nice to see you again.
Thank you.
Rach! Rach!
Stay well.
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Oh, hi!
Oh my God, I'm married!
Why not?!
Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Well, that's because of a lot of...
Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
What's the matter?
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
No, it was. It was very very good.
Hello all!
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
Hi...dad.
Hi Mr....Bing.
Hi, Julie!
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Hi, Julie.
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Hi, Kate!
Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Nooo.
Hi, Lauren.
Hi, Lauren.
Hi, Lauren.
Nooo.
Hi, Kate!
Hi, Lauren.
Hi, pig!
Hi, Phoe.
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
Esther Livingston. Gone.
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Oh, just updating the phonebook.
Hi, pig!
Hi, Lauren.
Hi, Lauren.
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Really?! You?
Okay!
Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Yeah.
Well, it's kinda dangerous.
Hey. I was...
My parents will be so happy.
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
Hey!
I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.
Okay, see ya.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
Yeah.
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
Us too.
Oh, great.
Like a log.
I'm going for a walk.
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
You think about it.
Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
You really sure?
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
I'll call you back.
So we can be friends who sleep together.
You were saying?
Hombre?
Yeah. All right.
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
What?
He does?
Why?
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Say again?
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Very bad!
You did a bad thing!
Yes, I did.
Very bad.
Very, very bad.
Yeah, let's go.
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
Hey! You wanna go?
Okay. See you guys later.
Bye guys.
Joey, bravo!
I'm comin' out!
And she's supposed to buy this?!
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
Joey, onstage!
Well, so, stay for the museums!
I'm sorry.
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
Where are you Vic?
Woooo! Yeah!
Yeah, okay. Alright.
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Phoebe, you're on.
Oh, oh, good.
Yeah! C'mon!
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Tah-daaah!
Sure I do.
Okay.
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
Yeah, am I in it?
Honey, you are in it.
I don't think so.
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Oh, I do. How you doin?
I'm OK
I love you Drake.
No, no, they only said you.
Oh, ok. Alright.
Yeah, whatever. Oh no.
Drake, look out.
I love you sweetheart.
She's right there.
Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
You look beautiful. Is this new?
Not now.
You don't say!
You'll see.
Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.
Good luck, babe.
Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
But you're not.
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
God. I love you.
Bye dad.
I'll be okay.
Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?
Not really.
Good. Bye!
Good to see you too!
How you doing?
Okay! You take care!
Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Professor Geller?
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Yeah?
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Yeah, they're fine.
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
Yeah?
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
What're you doing?
Get the what?
Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
We're baack!
You said...
I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! .
Hey!
What are you guys doing together?
We're closing.
Ms. Waltham?
Yes?
All right.
And could I get my ring back?
Here I am!
Ohh, thank you.
I'm so happy that you're here.
Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth's here! Who are you talking to?
Uh, you guys?
Actually, me too.

Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Oh damn, I hate that.
Oh. Whew!
Excuse me?
Oh! Him.
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Hello Tilly.
A little what?
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.
That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
No, no, no.
Atta boy.
OK, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
C'mon kid, let's go.
I am Julio.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Is there a Julio here?
Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
Yes I am.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Yeah.
You're an Aquarius, huh?
Hi-hi Joey.
Wafer thin ice!
Hey, I'm back!
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
I-I'm sorry?
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Chandler?
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
Wh-what's that?
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm...
It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
I am so sorry.
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
It's the Gellers!
Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
Sorry, what?
Where?
Well there's one and there's another .
Absolutely, yeah!
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
Look at that.
You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
Oh my God.
I know.
Well? Isn't that amazing?
All right, fine.
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
Monica! Come on!
I just did them.
Could I play?
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
What?
Is it bad?
Tell me.
I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
I'll talk to her.
That's not all.
That's all!
Ohhhh!! ...What? What?
Oh sure it is!
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
And the spitting?
Oh my god.
The screaming guy?
You gotta hear this story.
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
Are you serious?
You are so precious, I could just take you home.
Hey, why don't you?
Uh-huh, yeah!
Oh, thanks.
Dr. Oberman.
Ross.
Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?

Of Ross and Rachel.
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
Wow! Skates!
Hi!
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
Well...
Hola, Joey!
Mira, Mira, el viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop!
Ewww!
Hola, amigos!
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Me neither.
Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
No.
3, 2,
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
A bitch?
I thought it was... quite tasty.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
A lesbian?
Sorry. You look good too.
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
A sandwich?
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
Oh, you know what?
A surfer.
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
A lover?
Oh yeah surfer?
I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
A tad.
No you don't!
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
A test?!!
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
What are you doing?
Baby. Ross.
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
Hi Daddy.
Dr. Green. How are you?
Thanks for dinner last night.
Someone in here.
Don't you have to use the bathroom?
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
Where's Chandler?
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
I, I don't know.
Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
I'm with Hamilton!
Well then, what is it?!
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Um, I'm not.
Okay.
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
Kiss me!
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Oh, Chandler, sorry.
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Let's reset.
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
That can be arranged.
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Let's take it from there.
Like lovers.
Life partner.
Like buddies.
You know how close women can get.
Susan and I live together.
Sorry Phoebs.
The guy still won't put out, huh?
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
Who's next?
Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
Hi there!

Oh, you didn't see the Post?
No. You?
Hey there Ross!

Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"

Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
Oh my....
Hi.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Pizza guy!
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Thank God. Food.
Phoebe?
Carol, not me.
Susan and I live together.
Although I was married to her.
Err, right.
Its a little complicated.
You have pets!
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
Yeah, I heard it.
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Thanks a lot.
Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
I guess you can.
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
All right.
What's with him?
So they're going on dates? When?
I think Saturday-.
Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
Okay!
Goodbye Geller.
Oh yes, there you are.
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
Very busy.
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
Okay! How you doin'?
Right! Okay.
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
We're just friends.
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
What?
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
What four of us?
Ahh, nooo!!
Ugh. Ross!
Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
You're a genius, Ross.
Who's they?
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
No one.
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
That's so sweet.
The bigger half.
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
And a crappy New Year.
Well it's gone.
Oops.
What was, what was that?
What?! How's that?
It got caught on my watch.
I'll remember that.
So uh, do you live around here?
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
Phoebe, listen...
Uh, Phoebe you-you don't have an office.
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
You lost 13 million dollars.
Uh huh.
Exactly.
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Oh, you've tasted it.
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Do it again!
Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
Eee!!
Hi.
Hi! Hi Ben!
You're so sweet!
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
Ohh, you're so sweet!
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Okay, we're not.
Yeah, we are.
No, we're not!!
Right.
But, we are.
That's not true?
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
No.
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Um, cheers.
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
That's just great.
Oh, right, clink.
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
Looks like it.
I can't promise anything.
We're really gonna do this, huh?
Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at...
I got it!
You can have it!
Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Well, I want it!
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Oh, no! No!
Are you all right?
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
Oh my God, are you guys okay?
Oh my.
Hey.
Can't wait!
See ya tomorrow!
Tomorrow!
How are we gonna get out of that one?
What?
Can't wait.
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Come on, they're gonna love you.
Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
Guess who?
Yes. Yes I do.
I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
Department of Sanitation?
It's me!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Okay.
G'night.
Okay, see ya!
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
You take care Jill.
Bye-bye-e!
Bye.
I'm afraid so.
Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.
Just mine?
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
Phoebe Buffay?!
I am so hot for you right now.
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
A little what?
He's kind of intense huh?
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Hello Tilly.
Are you alright?
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
My God, you're choking! That better?
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Oh! Wow! Hey!
You ready to go to the batting cage?
Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.
Thanks daddy.
Uh-huh!
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
Okay. Okay.
You are mad!
Why don't we what?
Get married.
No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
We've only known each other for six weeks!
I hate you!!
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
And, I love you!!
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
All right. Bye.
Bye Phoebe.
Okay bye.
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
You're so bad!
Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
Rachel stop!
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
You would think.
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
What?!
But, we are.
Okay, we're not.
Right.
Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
I can promise not to tell her again.
It's not Rick.
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
No, it's-it's Andrew.
Hey-hey-hey Joey!
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Hey Terry!
Good to see you again!
Professor Geller!
Spring vacation.
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips...
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Whoa! Ohh!!
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
I love you, too.
Bye, Richard.
Bye sweetie, I love you.
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
What are you talking about? What wedding?
Uhh, I can't.
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
Oh, you have some studying to do?
No, I have some turning 21 to do.
Ms. Waltham?
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
I am, aren't I?
Yes?
We're closing.
Well,... thanks.
I read to you.
I sang. Hah!
Oh, my pleasure.
You're welcome.
Whaddyou mean?
You have me!
Nono, just you.
Lose the other guys.
...Like, ...all of them?
Where's Buddy?
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
Buddy?
My fish, Buddy.
I'll see you later.
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
I will give you a call.
Okay!
I forgot my paper.
Yes it is.
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
That's not mine.
How do you know?
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
The other us.
Oh, you and me?
Uh, no, Susan and me.
Ok.
We're uh, we're getting married.
Is this true?
I'm not Drake.
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
I brought you something.
Really?
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
I had them made special.
Oh. Uh, what?
Umm, anyway...Do you want to have dinner tonight?
Yes! Oh no!
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm...
Uh, the dog.
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
Huh.
Yeah.
$4.50 please.
Really?!
Hm-mmm.
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Happy Thanksgiving!
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Well, this has been great!
See ya!
Monica! What...
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
That bitch!
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Oh-oh, Phoebe!
Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.
What do you know?!
Ooh! Hi!
Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?
I'll join you.
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room.
Okay.
I'll get our seats.
Okay. So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
No, I'm Mary-Theresa.
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
I am!
What do you think?
Oh my God!!
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Huh. Yeah?
That's so exciting.
What did he say?
Something about hi.
Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
You kids ready?
You really serve people sneezers?
Well um, I don't.
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
All right.
I live upstate.
I'm not coming back.
Why not?
Yeah, so did I.
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Hey, it's everybody.
Oh, my, god!
Geez, look how fat she got.
Janice, you're--
Yes, I am.
No, go ahead.
Okay, it must just be me then.
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Thanks.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........
Ohhh, man!!
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
Not if I get there first.
What is that?
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
Shall we?
Honey.
What, what oh....
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
Three babies?
Yes.
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
I finally got my band!
We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
Hello Skidmark.
And she's back in the game.
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
It's pretty clear.
Hello darlings.
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
And there's daddy!
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
I don't have a monkey.
What about it?
Gimme back my monkey.
Then what's with all the bananas?
Potassium.
No no no!
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Sit down.
This is a glaucoma test.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
But your chin here. Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
Stay well.
I tell ya a lot things!
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Rach! Rach!
Very tasteful.
Oh really, OK.
That's great.
Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
Yes.
God. I love you.
But you're not.
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
I guess we just keep dancing.
Okay, I'll do it.
Everybody!
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
You'll do what?
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.
No we won't.
We'll go to a hotel.
No you won't.
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
I really can't say.
Yeah. How 'bout that.
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
I can't say.
Thanks! You too.
Oh, that must be it.
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
You said she was bald.
Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
Yeah, okay. Alright.
Yeah, you wish!
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Woooo! Yeah!
Yeah, yeah. Why?
Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
Lilly's dead.
She what?!
Melt stuff.
October 25th.
That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Okay, I've got three of my five.
Three of your five, what?
W-w-w-wait! Why?!
No, no?
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
Is this yours?
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
Well actually...
No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine.
Ross, are you okay?
What?
Are you into crafts at all?
Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
It's a bathing suit?
I'm moving in.
So, does this come in another color or...
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
And for you sir?
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
It's uh, it's already been roasted.
Here, we are.
Okay. See?! I told ya!
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
The what?
Okay, go ahead.
Wait! Hold on! Hi!
Hi!
Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
My God, Joey!
We're back on.
You're right. Of course you're right.
So we're back on?
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Take it easy.
What?!
I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
Dumbass!
Hey Pheebs! How's it going?!
No, don't say it.
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
...love you.
Are you're hands still wet?
You want some?!
Who drank all the Kamikazes?
Nobody! We put them in here!
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Yeah, sure.
Anything else?
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
Hard quality.
Daryl Hannah.
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
Bye, Richard.
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
Bye sweetie, I love you.
I love you, too.
Can't complain.
Hi Phoebe.
So how are things going with you?
Come on.
Okay.
I-I do though.
Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
I do too.
Bye Phoebe.
No! Come on!
What is he doing here?!
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
All right!! Fine! Fine.
Arrrghh!!
Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
Right. My name was on there, but now it just says "carrot cake". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?
All of them.
Hey guys! Hey!
Yeah.
Lets not do that any more.
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
I can't do that!
What kinda change?
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Yeah, but this is
I wasn't invited.
He's getting married tomorrow right?
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
You don't wanna know.
So, how are you doing?
I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
No, I really, really do.
Well, he's doing terrible!
What's a nubbin?
What's that?
That's-that's my nubbin.
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
You have three nipples?
What's a virgin?
I'm not allowed to have soda.
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
Water it is.
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
I love your car.
Nice car!
Yeah, it's not mine.
Yeah, it's mine.
I bet it's fast.
Any luck?
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
Any progress?
What?
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
God Joey, this is taking forever!
Brooklyn Heights.
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
Cleveland.
How, how did that happen?
Fine, whatever.
How's it going?
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
Heh... y'know?
Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
Right! You're right!
You know what?
What?
Well, you were fired.
What are you doing here?
All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
Nu-uh!
I told that guy who answered your phone.
What do you mean?
I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
Smell familiar?
Oh no.
I get that a lot.
No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
Ohh!
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
I'm right here!!!!
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
Earl! I'm Phoebe.
Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
Yeah, but you didn't.
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
No, but it's-it's-it's hot!
Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
You have a son?
I beg your pardon?
No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
Let's go Phoebe!
We're still rolling!
You're making one right now!
And-and you're using my name!
Yeah, can I help you with something?
Oh, look at that.
What do you see? What do you see?
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
What does he look like?
Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
In the park?
How did you know?
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Just those two!
Oh, hello Ross!
Do you want to know?
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
Susan...
So, so, did you hear?
Well, not just for you.
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
For...me.
Well, what do you mean?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
Chandler's a girl!
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Hey, where's his thing?
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Wait a minute!
Ready to go?
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Ross, I love you!
I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello.
Hi.
Ohh! Thank you.
Hey.
Sorry, it's not.
Would you like some gum?
Um, is it sugarless?
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
Ross, I'm gonna go.
Hi! Remember me?
Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
Go? Why?
I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
I didn't read it.
Uhh-huh.
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
Yeah.
I thought of a thing.
Monica, wake up. Monica.
What's up?
Yeah?
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
Thank you so much.
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Hello Ross. I love what you've done with this space.
How hot is this?!
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
So, you look great.
Hi!
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
Right.
No you do. You... just...
I love that idea!
Like what?
Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Phoebe, come on!
And-and you're using my name!
Yeah, can I help you with something?
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
What's not funny?
Hey Ross!
Hi.
Practical jokes.
Oh I...I think they're funny.
Ohh, so cute.
I knew it, wow!!
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
I know. I'm mad at me too.
Oh, that's attractive.
Hey, buddy.
Hi.
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Oh that's so great!
Will you be my maid of honour?
Of course!
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
That's all!
That's not so good.
What'd I get?
Seven.
No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
Hi guys!
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
She's your partner.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
Hi. I'm Monica.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Both of you?
Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
Uh, we are here to break up with you.
Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
Someone in there?
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
Yeah, sure.
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
I can't believe it!
I am?!
Yeah!
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Hey.
Charlotte who?
So you watched the movies huh?
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
Alright, you wanna feel better?
Eight months.
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
That's a really long time.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Except stilts.
No but he didn't really talk about anything.
Oh.
Stilts?
Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.
Its Jake.
Sure, I'd like that.
So uh, what's your name?
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Yeah, big fan.
M-Me again?
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
Sure! Why not?
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
Oh!... Right!
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Hey Rach!
How'd it go?
Tag Jones.
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
Uh-huh, go on.
That's it. That's my whole name.
Whaddyou want?
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
Yep, sucks!
We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
Hi you!
Oh my God!
That would work.
Lose the robe.
Me?
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
Oh! God! Wow!
Catch any big fish?
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
You stink!
Are you kidding?!
But like how?
What kinda noise?
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Yes sir.
What's going on?
What?
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
She may have died.
She may have died?
Maybe you should.
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
That could be it.
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
It is Judy.
Well that's wonderful. . . I
Mom, it's OK.
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
Found it.
Tell her what?
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Hey! You're back!
Morning's here! The morning's here!
Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here!
Hey! Get into gear!
Breakfast is near!
There she is.
Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!
Mom!
Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
No, it's really good.
No.
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Can I use.. either thumb?
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
Good for me!
Y'okay, Phoebe?
I hate actors.
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
I'll talk to her.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
Excuse me.
Ohh! That's great!
Licorice?
Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
I'll talk to her.
Is it bad?
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
I hate actors.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
Oh, maybe that's it.
What's different?
Nothing.
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Hey! I missed you.
Hey!
Hi!
Oh, I missed you too.
Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
Who are you?!
I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
I don't think so.
What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother?!
Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
Really? You two?
Well you, her, I mean, she's very...y'know. And you're like...y'know.
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Yeah! Rach?
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
You too sweethart!
Hi Rachel!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Hey!
Oh my!
Is that supportive?
It's a bathing suit?
To wear in front of people?
Is this?!
Hey!
Well, here it is.
Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
No.
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
So, what's up?
Yo!!
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Uh-huh. G-good deal.
Christmas eve.
Christmas.
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Cut! Wonderful!
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Great scene yeah?
Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
Fair enough.
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Zelner.
Flexible hours.
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
What?!
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Humm, really?
What?
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
Uhh, not that I know of.
January first.
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
So when, when do you leave?
Hello?
Hey!
Ohh. Ouch.
Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
What'd I get?
Why?!
Well you need 60% to pass...
Seven.
That's not so good.
Oh, hi Rachel.
Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Oh, God forbid.
Hi.
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
I'm in love with you.
Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
Well that brings me in the loop a little.
You see, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious...you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater...
Oh, yeah! Right!
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Are you guys gonna be okay?
Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
Oh I'd like that.
Excuse me?
Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Thank you. Uh...
Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
Oh, umm, all right.
Hello. Hello.
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
So how did you know Francis?
Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
What do you see?
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
So am I!
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
Where you goin'?
Woah.
Foxy lady.
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
The Ice Capades?
Can I help you?
Yeah!
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Uh-oh.
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
I could have birds.
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
You don't have birds.
Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
I could have cats.
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
You dont even have cats.
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Well try to keep it down.
Oh Rachel, uhh...
It's really nice to see you again.
Thank you.
What?
Just ah...
Why don't we what?
Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
No, no, don't. Why don't we?
Get married.
You are mad!
Yeah! Oh my God!
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Here you go.
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
Hey, Ben! Hey!
Hey! How's Ben?
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
So umm, any word from Susan?
Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
That's a good one.
Really? Like how?
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
Yeah? You like that one?
Yeah, you're funny.
What about Benitez?
Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
What about Game 1 of the Series?
What about shut up?
What about Julie?
Rachel, that's all we do.
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
Well, that could take a while.
Hi, I'm Joshua.
In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
Hi!
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife...
Hi, I'm Karen.
No, we'd just like to close them.
Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. Would you come over here please?
I wanna quit the bank!
Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
Hi, I'm Lisa.
Well, my nose got lonely.
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
Hi.
Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Hi, I'm Maria.
No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?
Wow, you have really pretty feet.
These old things.
Hi, I'm Sandy.
Vividly.
Hi.
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
Yeah. That's okay, right?
Yeah, I know, I.
Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
Huuh.
I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
It's uh, $12.50.
Caitlin!
Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
Where are we?
Hey, can I ask you something?
Sure.
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
Just tell me the truth.
Um, excuse me.
Im gonna wait till after we order. Its her, right.
It looks like her.
Yeah?
Hi, its us.
How do you know?
What's the matter?
I have a feelin'... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.
Well y'know, he's got access.
Yeah.
You are so fired.
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
What?
They're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules.
May I see it?
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
Um, yeah.
Um, no.
Come on!
Also Monday.
What?!
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
C'mere, Patti.
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.
C'mere, Marcel.
C'mere, Patti.
Doesn't matter.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
What?
Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
Hope! Hope!
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!
Oh! Thank God!
Drake!
You're not dying Hope, you're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.
Kidney stones!
It's kidney stones.
Or?
All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.
They are. Why?
Life partner.
Im sorry, I didnt get... Susan is?
Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...
Like buddies.
Like lovers.
Sweetheart, sweetheart...
Hey, what's up?
You and me, next dance?
Yes?
You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?
Hey. Hi Phoebe.
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Hey.
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
I just had sex.
Ok...ay.
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Yes it does.
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
No, I mean happy.
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
You mean scared.
Scared? Happy?
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
Yeah, big fan.
Its Jake.
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
Oh hey, Pheebs!
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Hey!
Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
It can do this.
I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
It-it's great to meet you Paul.
Wow, that's great.
Oh.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
Oh, yeah!
Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
See what you did.
Now go!
Thanks a lot.
Yeah, listen...
Out!
Shut the book!
Stop it!
No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
Let's also get a hot plate!
Hey!
You wanna dance?
You did a good thing today.
Yeah.
No, that's fine.
Come on. I'll let you lead.
You wanna quit?
Good! That's good!
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
I wanna quit the gym.
You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
I was gonna say...
Ohh!
Nice luggage.
Hey!
Hi!
Yes, you said that.
...Yes?
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
Chandler?
Hey, be right there.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
Hey, big guy, game time.
There's a game?
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
You think so too?
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
How's it going?
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
Hi.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
Fine, whatever.
That's kinda sad.
Okay Ross! Please don't die!
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
Got it!
Why should we?
No.
Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
Yeah, we're gonna go.
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Yeah, okay, bye.
Okay, bye!!
So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
So I'm gonna take off then!
What's so funny?
An advance?
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Congratulations! Congrats!
We have great news!
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
I know, I'm so excited!
So am I!
Daryl Hannah.
Could you speak up please?
Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
Hard quality.
G'bye, everybody.
You got it.
Okay.
Bye.
Whoo-hoo!
Pizza delivery!
It's a diaper commercial.
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
I'll get it! I will get that!
Hi!
Pizza delivery.
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.
Rach.
Push, push!
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Wait! You forgot your legs!
We're here!
Where have you been?
Thats unbelievable.
Youre kidding? She seems so...
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
Twenty-four actually.
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Me too.
Uh-oh, busted!
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Uh-oh, tunnel.
I'm in my boss's car!
What?!
What?!
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
I wish I could.
Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
So, then you can stay as long as you want.
Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
Yeah, little Eric.
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
That's right! Wait no, Ben.
So you've just married the one time then?
Well, that was ah...
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
Better?
Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.
All right, man!!
It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
Then you hold on to it!!
All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
You're Frank's best man?!
You are so sweet.
Oh my God! What are you doing here?
I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you.
Me too.
Nice to meet you.
Rachel.
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Who's out there?
With such a sad history.
Could there be more Kims?
It's me! Good morning!
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
We can't do that.
I know, I can do this.
Ooh, and I can do this.
Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Dance with him.
Yeah, well.
See, he's her lobster.
Mom, I'm hungry.
Dance with your father.
I can't believe this!
Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
No, I have faith...
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
I don't get it.
No! You have lasagnas!
Ding!
I would really like that.
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
That was...so good.
Hey.
Tell me everything.
Yeah.
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Hey guys.
Hey.
Thanks a million.
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
Awww.
Oh, you're welcome a million.
Okay, I'll see you in our room.
Umm, I'm still here.
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
What?!
Oh, good. Thank you.
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Dear?
But, you got up!
What do you mean, your seat?
I mean, I was sitting there.
But, I never left the room!
But, you left the chair area.
How are you honey?
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
All right. I think it was a mouse.
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
We get high.
I thought you didn't smoke.
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
Oh, me too.
I'm kidding.
Drake, look out.
I love you Drake.
Yeah, whatever. Oh no.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Did they just kill off Joey?
Well, you seem fine.
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
You mean like exclusive friends?
Sharing is good.
When's my daddy coming back?
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Really? Like how?
Oh hi Phoebe.
Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Mr. President.
I came to talk to you about Howard.
So I was wondering....
He says he was too.
Interesting.
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
You too, sir.
Hi.
Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
Dad, dad.
Uh-huh, I don't know.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
Hey.
I'm sorry, I do that.
Is this about me taking your watch?
You took my watch?
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
Oh, ok. Alright.
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?
No, no, they only said you.
I love you Drake.
Yeah, whatever. Oh no.
No, I don't know him.
Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
I think that's fair.
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
Yeah, yeah, maybe.
So.
So maybe we should just. . .
Wow, this really sucks.
Yeah, it sure does.
You are so bad!
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
Like it would help.
You are!
You are!
Well someone does.
No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It's looks like a curling iron.
I don't use a curling iron.
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
It could've been a hair straightener.
Oh, we're not together.
Isn't she cute? No!
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
Oh, sly.
Yeah, I'm her date.
Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.
A date.
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
Like a hound?
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
Not a basset, a bassinet.
You really need the bassinet?
Ho-ho, I will.
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
I mean really, think about it.
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
Oh, it looks great!
So what did you do today?
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
...and then it got canceled.
Well, I could cut it.
Yeah, come on in.
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.
Jason?
So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
Nah-ha!
Hey, hey Ross.
Hi!
Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.
Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
I do Raquel.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
Well I just thought...
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
It's a curling iron.
You ready to go?
Kate?
Yep.
Yeah.
Very nice. Very nice.
Hi! Remember me?
Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face and her chest I could really put something together.
Could I borrow it?
Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
Ross, I'm gonna go.
Did he call?
Well, they always called.
Hmm, bite me.
No. Sorry.
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
Where are they?
You wanna explain that?
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Well that's ambitious.
Ohh, it's time to go.
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
That's Carol with your son!
You're doing it again.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
We're not doing anything.
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
Also large?
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Okay.
Cantaloupe juice.
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
Exactly.
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Count faster.
You're gonna kill me!
15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
Who the hell is Jordie?
Diet Coke.
Here you go honey!
Ahh. Thank you!
Op, ice. I need ice.
Okay.
France sucks!
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
Oh, say no more!
Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
Okay.
Ahhhhh!
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
He's... new.
No, it's-it's Andrew.
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
No, that's not exactly what I was..
Knick fan?
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, boy, do they suck.
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Down at the docks again?
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
Here's my binoculars.
Noo! NO!
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
So, should I call him back?
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
October 25th.
I know a guy who's the 18th.
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Melt stuff.
Twenty percent.
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
Ohh!
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Oh honey, I'm fine.
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
You really ok with it?
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
What? Alright, what about my two?
Hey, you like pizza?
Just one drink?!
So, where do you want to go?
Oh, that's sounds great.
I know a great little place.
Or your keys.
No, you can't use your watch.
Ok.
Ok.
Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.
You think I'm hot?
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
Y'know it's ironic...
It's laminated!
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
What?
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
What kinda change?
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
I can't do that!
You must be Ross.
So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
Nah-ha!
Hi.
I am Guru Saj.
And for the gentleman?
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
That sounds great. Same for me.
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
I'm not coming back.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
Why not?
I live upstate.
He started it!
All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
Why?
No, you started it.
You did!
How ya doin'?
You?
No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
I'm a twinkie.
Really? I'm a hero.
Who told you that?
I-I-I'm leaving the show?
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Oh uh, one of the writers.
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Thank you.
You and your ice.
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
I found the picture!
Just the last two pages.
All right.
Picture? What picture?
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
It's me, Carl.
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
Who is it?
C'mon up.
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Oh, okay, I get it.
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Howard's the handy man!
We don't have to.
Hello?
Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
Your not doing it.
What, wait, you mean like this?
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
When's your birthday?
That would be great!
I really like waking up with you.
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
We could have breakfast in bed...
Wait, just a second.
Oh yeah, aww!
Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! Who would do a think like that?
3-B!
Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
Yeah, leave!
Maybe in L.A?
Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
Yes!
There you go.
I can't help you Joey.
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
Yeah, I was just kidding.
No, bribes.
It's okay to laugh right?
Okay.
I'll check the kitchen floors.
Ready to go?
Hey!
Hey sweetie!
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
Wait a minute!
I miss you already!!
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
I miss you too!!!!
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
Yeah, isn't he?
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
You okay, kiddo?
Whaddya see?
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Yeah, okay.
Alright.
Oh my God, Phoebe.
Who?
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
Oh my God, Rachel!
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Oh my God, Jill!
Oh my God, introduce us!
This is Chandler.
May I help you?
Lotsa things.
Which one do you think she is?
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
I'm a little embarrassed.
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
Then why did she ask us to...
How did you know?
Oh my God!!
All right!
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
In the park?
No, but I can't-
No, but I'm asking-
Oh, but I can't do that-
It's your thing, and-
-make the decision-
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
Congratulations.
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
They have parasites?
Yeah, it sure is!
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
What people?
Hi, this is Richard.
Stop it. Stop it!
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
You have three new messages.
Not any more!
It's good to see you.
You've got panties stuck to your leg.
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
It's good to see you too.
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
No! They did!
Hey!
Jill! Did you shop?!
Yeah, we went shopping!
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
Ross!
What? What?
Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
Hi, did you order some bananas?
Because I-I like you.
No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
Why?!
You like me?
Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
Huh. That's nice.
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Rachel is my girlfriend.
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Okay.
So, this was uh, really fun.
Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
Hey! Me too!
I know. I'm mad at me too.
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
Oh-hooo, I missed you.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Really?
Are you gonna play?
Okay, one thing at a time.
Ahhh!
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
Hi, its us.
Um, excuse me.
Yeah?
Right, and its me.
So, so youre here too?
But it's my car!
What-what are you doing?
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
Yeah, but it's my wax.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
Yeah, we'll see!

Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Well, sure, that too.
Because we can remember them.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Can't hear you!
Can't hear you!
Well, sure, that too.
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
No ma'am.

Good morning Rachel.
We want the last six years back!!
So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Went out with Joey.
You are so adorable.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was...
That! Let's talk about that.
Hey!
That's a good one!
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Hey, Joe.
Dad, Ronni's here.
Oh hello, Ross.
Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
Hi, Mrs. Green.
So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
I don't think so dear.
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
Oooooh...
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
...and this guy...
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
200 at least.
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
We're outta here!
Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies have been.
You are just nonstop!
Why?!
Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
Thanks. You want it?
Hey.
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
Huh?
Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
No, we don't.
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
No.
Chandler is fantastic!!
Hmm.
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
What?!
Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
Maybe I should go!
Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat.
No! You can't do that!
Sit down! We're winning!
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
What is going on?
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
What's going on?! That's what's going on!!
Ross!
It's my baby too.
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
You have not changed!
Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken?
No. No food with a face.
Yeah, you too.
Hi, remember us?
...Now? Now?
Rrrreally.
Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
Oh yeah, right now.
Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.
Aaahhhh. AAAAHHHHHH.
Do we dare?
We dare.
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
Animal Control.
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
See? I've even called Animal Control!
You called Animal Control?
Auntie Monica!!
Hi!
Hi Ben!
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
I think they're very nice.
Bodington's! Woohoo!
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
Bodington's!
Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
Bona sera.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
Oh, please...
Oh, hi sweetie.
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?

Okay.
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
Y'know what? We need to move on.
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
Candy Lady?
We want candy! We want candy now!
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
No not Candy Lady.
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
Ciao, bela.
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Goodbye, baby.
Do they wait for me to do this?
So are you gonna tell him?
Earl Grey?
Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
Yeah sure.
Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Wait a minute. What's his name?
Bob Buttons?
Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Mmm hmmm.
Yeah, you too.
Hi, remember us?
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
You're that stupid.
Not.... helping!
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
You're doing great, you're doing fine.
Hello! Oh, sorry.
Ready, Annabelle?
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
You bet. Maybe some other time?
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Red Barbra?
Oh.. Never mind. Who are you?
Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
Yeah.
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Rough numbers?
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Sooo!! Anyway...
It's not that kind of anniversary.
Ah! Oh.
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
Spring vacation.
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
Oh, okay. What-what about?
Spring vacation.
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips...
Woooo hoooo!!!
Yeah.
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
Why, what happened?
YOU IDIOT!!!!!
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you're a real special lady, but my divorce isn't final yet and, and, and we've been on four days, so I'm thinking "No, but thanks."
Your name, please?
Joey Tribbiani.
Oh, so did I.
Oh, I missed you too.
Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
No tongue.
Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!
He is? Why?
Who?
Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
You got me.
Right.
With a K.
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Oh-oh-hey!
Wow! You are really good at this.
You wear bi-focals?
Ross, whose glasses are those?
Mine.
Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
Of course I do.
You do?
Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
You're right. Of course you're right.
I can help with that.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
Hi!
To the Bings!
Doctor Ross Geller.
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
I'll do it.
No, I'm still married.
No.
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Honey, you are in it.
Sure I do.
Yeah, am I in it?
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
Oh, yeah!
Hey, Dr. Farber.
We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
I had a bra.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
What?!
What kinda noise?
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
But like how?
Here's my binoculars.
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
How did you--?
Yes?
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
Thanks.
I'd rather not.
What?
Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
Oh, yeah, why not?
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
Alright, I'll call you.
Well, what do you want me to say?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
I don't think you mean that.
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
He does that?!
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
Uh, I don't know, whatever.
I think it makes you look really dangerous.
Ohh, Ross, please!
I wish I didn't have to go.
Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
One more day, seriously/
Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
You told on us?
Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
He told on us?
Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
Don't play with his things.
You thought I was Rachel?
Well, my goodness, what was that?
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
Yes because uh, you look so young.
And because you're both, you know, white women.
You got married again.
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
Yes.
So that's your second marriage in two years.
This should be fun.
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
My breast milk is gross?
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Okay. I'll miss you.
But you tell it really well, sweetie.
Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
Isn't he great?
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
And tell him what?
Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
What's with this guy?
Is that supposed to be funny?
No actually, I was just going for colorful.
What's with you?
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
Where's your baby?
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Ben! Ben! Ben!
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
What about the duck?
Oh! It's on! It's on!
There we go little fella.
Well the duck can swim.
Oh, jeez.
I love you, love you.
Okay, I love you.
I love you.
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
So, what do you thing the good news is?
Shes still here.
Nina.
Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Yeah, could you scooch?
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
Yeah, move over just a little bit.
Keep on scooching.
Well that's not true.
You found that handle, did ya?
That's not funny.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
That's pretty much it.
Oh!!
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
Oops!
But you tell it really well, sweetie.
Okay, well g'night.
You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
Good night.
Don't be too long.
Rach, are you okay?
Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
Yeah. Well, umm.....
Yeah, I'm fine.
You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
I'll take it all.
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
How's my Bing-a-ling?
You okay?
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Why are your eyes so white?
You don't like puppies?
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Is there a puppy here?
Okay, you are new!
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
Yes, at 4:00.
Okay.
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
I'd better get back to my desk.
We're getting married!
Oh my God!
Yes!
Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?
Yes.
How did we do?
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Hey!
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
I did not freak out.
What, look back?
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
I'll never forget you.
Uh, ow.
Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
Here's your scone.
What? Oh!
Sorry man.
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
When's your birthday?
Your not doing it.
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
Feburary 16th.
I know a guy who's the 18th.
You did it twice?
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
Okay...
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I'm family, I'm it. Now, now I'm done.
But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
Is there a problem?
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
Uh-oh.
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Then we agree?
Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so.
Neither of us like Ross!
Where are you Vic?
Joey, onstage!
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
I have a little comb.
No.
Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
Oh. And what do you call that?
A moustache comb.
We've got a problem.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
Tell me.
I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
Good bye Ross.
I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Uh, oh-ho bye.
Here we go people! Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la... Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
Over a month.
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Sure, I'd like that.
You wanted to see me?
Hi.
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Which is bad, because?
Oh that would be great!
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
Joey, you don't have too!
No more pranks.
I know! Robin is so gay!
So now what have we agreed?
And-and what else?
That you and daddy were not on a break.
It was my quarter!
What?!
She sells drugs to kids.
Was it her quarter?
How about we talk about this over dinner?
Really? I'm a hero.
How ya doin'?
I'm a twinkie.
Oh, this is so hard.
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
What happened son?
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Chandler! You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being.
Uh, bye Monica.
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
Bye Dan!
Bye, momi-moo.
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
Oh, yeah. I know that.
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
I so wanna be attracted to you.
But you're not. Okay, good.
Don't spoil it.
Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
Isn't this great?!
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
What is with you tonight?
You okay there, slugger?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
I thought you didn't smoke.
Oh that's great! You are the best!
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
We get high.
Wait, just a second.
That would be great!
We could have breakfast in bed...
Okay. Oh! Oh no.
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Do you have a minute?
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
Hi!
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
Oh John! Great!
Do you know who at my office?
John?
Here he is.
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Judy, the kids..
Hi. Mom. Dad.
Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube.
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
Ohh, I thought that you....
Don't touch him!
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Hey! That's my car.
Well, I'll see you later.
Okay, take it easy.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
What-what are you doing?
Oh, my, god.
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
Hi, it's me.
Janice? You called Janice?
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
No, that was clenching.
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
Nice to see you Rachel.
Uh, wh-why?
No! It's nice!
Oh, hi!
So glad you brought someone.
What are you doing here?
No, thank you. Chandler!
Hello, Janice.
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Are you being British?!
You make me laugh.
Are you going to eat that bread?
Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
Hmm-Hmm.
Would you like to move over to the couch?
I can still see you!
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
All right!!
Hey.
So oysters, huh?
What people?
People! People say it! Come here!
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
No. I'm all alone.
Yes?
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
Daddy!!
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Let's dry 'em again.
Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler.
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
Where are you from?
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
Bakersfield.
I'm sorry?
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
Hey-hey.
Guess what, I got an audition!
Well, I'll see you later.
Really! You got a place upstate?
Sure!
Okay, take it easy.
Hey! That's my car.
I talk in my sleep.
No, please.
So uh, what are you in for?
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
So why don't you give me your number?
Are you gonna be okay?
Well yeah!!
OH...MY...GOD!!
I am now.
Okay.
Let's show 'em.
C'mon kid, let's go.
Ahh, are you hadsome.
Okay dad.
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining-Oh no.
I'm, I'm still me.
But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
Why are you yelling?
Ohh, I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Hi, honey.
Well, I could cut it.
Oh, it looks great!
...and then it got canceled.
Really?! You do that?
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
Oh Jack stop.
So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
C'mon, it's my birthday.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Here you go honey!
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Get up!
Ahh. Thank you!
Diet Coke.
No, not my touchie.
What did you say?!
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
What did he say?
Hello.
Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
Something about hi.
That's so exciting.
You mean like watch?
Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea.
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
Well, I don't think this, y'know.
What is this place?
Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Ooh, okay... good.
Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
I think we have an answer.
Ohh, nice choice.
Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Yeah.
Good luck.
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
Um, now. Phoebs.
I missed you. I'm gonna get changed.
OK.
Oh, right, OK. Ole.
What?
What did you say?!
A joke they would appreciate?
I'm thinkin' no.
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
No, not my touchie.
Here let me...
Just ah...
Excuse me?
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
What? He's cute!
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Is Brian...?
Do you want to know?
The sex of the baby, Ross.
Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
Oh, hello Ross!
Nice uh, costume.
Hey!
Hi!
Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'
E!
What-what are you doing?
Hey! That's my car.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
But it's my car!
Yeah. Hate him.
Basically we just feel that he's...
We hate that guy.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
No, but I'm asking-
Please.
Oh no no.
Oh, but I can't do that-
No, but I can't-
Which do I like?
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
Tell me about it!
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
It does sound appealing.
Oh. They don't.
Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
What?
What 'cha doing?
No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Oh!!
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Joey, I'm in!
All right. Good deal.
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Yeah?
Is all this true?
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
Oh Hans.
Ahh, are you hadsome.
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
C'mon kid, let's go.
Let's show 'em.
Uh, just a sec dad. OK, be cool, just be cool. OK dad.
Oh, I got that for him.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Oh, this is so cute.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Just those two!
In the park?
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
Come on! Speech!
Speech! Come on Monica!
Come on!
Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
He painted that.
And?
I'm out.
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
Let's see, ahhh... Where does the Pope live?
Is that my ass?
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
There he is!!
What?
You're in this picture?
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
Joey, right?
Your name, please?
Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you're a real special lady, but my divorce isn't final yet and, and, and we've been on four days, so I'm thinking "No, but thanks."
YOU IDIOT!!!!!
Joey Tribbiani.
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study. Uh, sir?
Oh, that's better then.
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
I see. Have you considered therapy?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Ahh that's the 2 points.
Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
I forgot my paper.
I'll see you later.
Okay!
That was amazing!
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
I forgot my purse.
Hey. Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Oh.
No, I really did forget my purse.
I-I-I don't think so.
Hi, I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.
I'm Chandler's new roommate.
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
But, he told me over the phone.
They're all tourists.
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Ohh. Like what?
No, I just thought it was cute.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
We're still rolling!
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
No I'm not.
You're making one right now!
Let's go Phoebe!
No, but that's bad!
No-no-no, the kiss was good.
Okay!
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
What?!
C'mon, this is us.
When are you coming home?
What? Guys, I'm not.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Waitressing?
You're paying for that.
I'm fine.
"Happy birthday to you!"
What? No-no it's her birthday!
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
Good idea! Yes!
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Let's do this alright.
Yes, and that's why we're here.
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
Oh, I totally agree.
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
What?
Oh no! Oh no!
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
Well, technically it seven billion years ago...
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Okay! Okay!
Monica! Hi honey.
It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
Hi!
All right, on the table.
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Good to see you too!
Ross!
Great to see you!
How you doing?
Good. Bye!
Can I do it to you?
Yeah, you're funny.
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Any minute now.
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Hey, this- Heyy...
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
I dropped a cup.
I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.
Wow! Umm....
...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
Oh, this is so great.
No I don't think so.
She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
No, thank you. Chandler!
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
Hello, Janice.
What are you doing here?
Where do you work?
No kidding.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
I-I'll call ya.
Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
Okay.
He's so funny!
Oh sure. Vince?!
OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
Yo!!
Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
Please stop it!
Stop it!
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
Okay uh, however...
But...
Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
Sophie, get in here!
Done!
And an assistant.
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
Whenever you're ready.
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
I think you look fine.
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
That's fine, thank you.
Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
Next.
Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
What do we got here?
Are you all right?
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
I'm not freaking out.
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Then why are you laughing?
It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
Well, I'm from California.
Oh.
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
I'm gonna work on that.
We're gonna give it another try.
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
Y'know, he hums when he pees!
C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
Nice to meet you Mac!
This is like the temporary robot, right?
No, I think it's cute.
The what?
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
Well, we've gotta go.
So how did everything go?
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Ok.

Keep on scooching.
Yeah, could you scooch?
Yeah, move over just a little bit.
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
What does that mean?
You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
That was...so good.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
I would really like that.
Hey.
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
Yeah, refrigerator college.
No, Frank.

Yeah.
Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!
Of course, sir.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Okay.
How did it go?
It's a different building.
Good to see you again!
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Why don't we start right now!
Why, what happened?
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
Well, I guess that's it.
What happened? What happened?
My marriage is over.
Lovely, just lovely.
How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Really? Thanks.
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Can you really do that?
What?!
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...
Thanks for your help.
Oh, here they are right here.
Oh good.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
Just call me Paul.
How can I help you?
Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
Isn't this great?!
Oh, I know...
Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
Don't spoil it.
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
What is going on?!
Bye, Nana.
Ross!
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
What?
Just keep smiling.
You may kiss the bride.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Okay.
Well, that went well. Yeah.
So long, Vic!
So this is it? Victor?
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
Phoebe, it's been two days.
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
I don't know, it's just...
I understand that would be difficult.
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
All right.
You wanna touch it?
Wow!!
Wh-haa-haa! Look what 'cha did!
Nooo, but it, but it's great.
Come on, touch it!
So what's your name?
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
I think it's important that you do.
Chandler.
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
I thought he was with you.
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
Oh, is there a problem?
What else do they add smell too?
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Oh my God! That was flirting?!
I thought it was toner.
Why?!
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
Really?!
Oh God help me.
No.
Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
Good to see you again!

Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo.
Okay, so it's a date.
Gary.
Gary.
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Really? About what?
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.

A real doctor?
So, who's the mystery man?

No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
Well that's wonderful. . . I
So, how are you doing?
I saw Richard.
Oh.

You don't wanna know.
Yeah. That's okay, right?
Hi, I'm Sandy.
Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
Par-tay!
That thing is not coming in here.
What a nice story!
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
You're a big scrud.
I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
What's a scrud?
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
She passed away.
I had a sister.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
Is everything all right?
Score! Now can we go?
See, that's why we don't let her play.
Um-hmm.
Uh-oh.
Oh, I thought I heard you.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
Hi!
You were gonna propose?
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
Yeah, it sure does.
Yeah, yeah, maybe.
Wow, this really sucks.
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Really?
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
No, I hate cats.
Eew! It's creepy looking!
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Wow! What an unusual cat!
I'll help you dial.
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Well that wasn't easy.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Ok, dinner's on.
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
You brought a carrot.
Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and-
What?! What is it?
What?
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
Why would you think that?
Here are the audition scenes.
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Everybody has to audition.
I wasn't ready for it.
No!
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Saw Regis Philbin once...
But you're not anymore!
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
No, I'm not.
'Cause you guys were on a break.
I'm not on the list!
Come on!
But, okay.
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
It's laminated!
I own this store.
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
So, does this come in another color or...
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
Bye bye Joey.
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
What a phony.
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Come on, lady!
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
Please, please take him too.
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
Oh, say no more!
France sucks!
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
-make the decision-
No, but I can't-
It's your thing, and-
Okay, um, stay.
Stay.
...from the syphilis.
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
Insane!
What?!
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
Kenny the copyboy.
Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
You and Ralph?
Hey.
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
Lose the robe.
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Me?
That would work.
She's not a twinkie.
Dad, I'm the twinkie.
You're the twinkie?
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
Oh please, a relationship.
Morning. Good morning.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Morning.
Morning, Paul.
He's got a girlfriend!
No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
What?
I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
I know! It's awful. I love you.
Hi, can I help you?
Marcel?
Marcel?
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
A monkey.
That might be fun.
Yes.
Or if you prefer, this table is available.
What were you thinking?!
I didn't know it was an auction!
I love both of you!
I think it makes you look really dangerous.
Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
Yeah?
I wish I didn't have to go.
Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, umm, no honey.
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
What's my last name?
Good call!
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Central Perk?
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.
Or I'll hear you.
I'll see you.
Bye.
That's it big girl! Come on!
Wait!
Still no luck.
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Do you want me to check again?
Monica, Monica is great.
Huh, I never really noticed.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
There is no father.
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
What's goin' on?
Hey baby, I'm back...
Hey Ryan, what's up?
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Chicken or small?
Will you call him?
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
Really?
Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
So now, what is this now?
This one's from me.
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Yep.
Ahh!
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
Give me the dice.
You're scratching. Give me the dice.
No.
No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
No, I-I-I gotta go.
I'm sorry.
Ohhh. Don't go.
No. No! No! No!
Honey, honey, people are looking.
So Santa's coming?
Santa's mad at me.
No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Yes! Santa's coming!
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
Poco... a leetle.
Si.
So you do know a little English.
Do you know the word crapweasel?
No.
It's a lovely apartment.
Yeah, OK.
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
I was just being polite, but, alright.
Oh please, a relationship.
She's not a twinkie.
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Really?
Nice to meet you too.
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Hi! Nice to meet you!
So, are you ready to go?
Yeah.
Huh, good luck!
Excuse me, I-I couldn't help overhearing, you're marrying Chandler Bing?
Yeah that's right.
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
Die Hard still great!
That's because they are.
So?
So... they sss-still seem normal.
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
Lovely to meet you.
Where?
Well there's one and there's another .
Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.
The Waltham Residence.
Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
Uh, they're not in it.
Uh, it's the college playoffs.
Oh, then go Vassar.
Ok, then just go.
Ok.
No that's my assistant.
Wow! How long were we arguing for?
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
Is-is he coming?
Umm, no.
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Oh we can't, we already have plans.
And there is Kevin.
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Can we please turn this off?
Noo way, Kevin.
Anytime you're ready.
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Ok.
Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Just aim for the bump.
But how about tomorrow?
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
Oh.
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
Oh, great! Me too.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Oh yeah, I'd love that.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Do you have a sec?
Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
You meant sex, right?
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
Are you alright?
You're going to Minsk.
No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
You mean Dr. Geller?
All right, I'm sorry.
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
I think I need a drink.
What?
Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
Scotch.
Oh, hi, darling!
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
Ah.
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Neither am I.
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
Hey, there.
Hi.
Well, it's kinda dangerous.
Really?! You?
Yeah.
Well, I like danger.
Okay, you guys free tonight?
Hey! How's Ben?
They-they-they can smell fear.
Hey!
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping.
Hey, Ben! Hey!
But we broke up.
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Oh.
Oh.
She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
Yeah, whatever. Oh no.
Oh, ok. Alright.
I love you Drake.
Drake, look out.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Oh well, I'm divorced.
Isn't this amazing?
How have you been?
Ohhh, wow.
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
Well I tell you what...
Yep.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
Yeah?
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
What four of us?
We're just friends.
Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Nice to meet you Joey.
Richard? We're ready for you. Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he's playing Vincent.
I'm doing my scenes with you?
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
No I didn't.
I bet it's fast.
I love your car.
Yeah, it's mine.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Yeah!
What's it look like?
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
Kinda like a big face without skin.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
So what do you want?
No, that's not exactly what I was..
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
You.
You have me!
Okay, everybody hold!
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Okay.
Next on the platforms are... ...you two! And... ...You two!
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
Where is this party?
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Here in Chelsea.
Who's party is it?
What is in the cup?!
What's in the cup, Ross?
Umm...
Okay, it's coffee.
Ice coffee? Tell me it's ice coffee!
Hi, Mrs. Knight.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Hi Frank.
Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
Yeah, but not just that.
Hey, what happened to you?
I'm going for a walk.
Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-Wait! Did you write this?
Your territory, huh?
Mornin'.
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Yeah. Bijan for men?
No thanks.
Nothing at all?
Oh really?
Yeah.
No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
I don't think I should say.
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Why's that?
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Okay.
Ohh, it's time to go.
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Well that's ambitious.
Uhh...Shall I go on?
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Yes, yes, do go on.
He better go on for what I'm paying.
Okay, Chandler, come on!
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
You have three nipples?
What's a nubbin?
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
It-it's really heavy.
Could you guys help me?
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
I-I am Kristen.
Wow. He's strict.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
What do we got there?
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
...in love with you.
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Don't say it.
Really?
Sorry.
What was all that about?
Okay, okay.
Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
He didn't have any.
All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
Well, what about his family?
Ok, so let's talk money.
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
You know where I work!
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
I do?
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
Oh, don't worry about it.
Oh damn, I hate that.
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
No, really you're gonna freeze.
No, I'm not.
Oh! Okay! Phew!
Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
Sure, I'd like that.
Over a month.
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
So uh, what's your name?
Its Jake.
But you're not bald.
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
Hair transplant.
It's not on my head.
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
Oh my God! Whoah!
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Well, what's the part?
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
It's kidney stones.
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
Umm, well, what else could it be?
Or?
Kidney stones!
It's raining men!
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life... It's raining men!
Hallelujah!
Amen!
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
It's all right. Sweetheart.
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
No, we just went out.
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
So you uh, still wondering?
You're smart. I like that.
Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
I don't speak English.
Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
You did a minute ago!
Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
Rachel Green's office.
Because they wanted me to audition!
You! An actor?! That's madness!
Tag? Hi, who was that?
Nobody. I was just practicing.
Yes, yes I was.
Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's oh it's-ew used. Umm, cool.
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
It really says that?!
How are ya man?
No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
Hey, mate.
Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
You're gonna kill me!
Breathe.
Breathe.
15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
Count faster.
You're straight. I get it.
Really? You think so?
I was talking to myself! You're going down!
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
I've never seen it!
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
Oh you should, it's great.
This place is really beautiful!
He told on us?
There you go.
Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
You told on us?
Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
Happy birthday sweetie.
Surprise.
Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Wow you, you. I had no idea.
Really?
Hello, is Ross there?
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Hello?
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
Yeah, I'd really like that.
What?
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Where's Chandler?
Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!
Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats.
Phew, close one.
I'm Megan Bailey.
Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I'd cry.
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
Have you found your dress yet?
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
Oh, there's our stop.
You done?
Yeah.
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
You guys live around here too?
Still no smile?
What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
Ameri-can.
Really? Like how?
Sharing is good.
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
That's a good one.
Very, very bad.
Very bad!
Very bad.
I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
No.
I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
I am not going to apologize to a tree!
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
Okay.
I know. I hate that!
No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
Dude!
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
Like it would help.
Hi!
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
You are so bad!
You are!
No, this is a loaner.
So how did you know I was even here?
Your mom called me. So is this her?
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?
Or I'll call you!
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
Oh and I'll call ya too!
And call me!
Okay, good to see you again.
No, it's-it's Andrew.
It's not Rick.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
He's... new.
As in my grandmother.
-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
...As in Mouse?
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
Julia..
That's cool. Cool.
Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
What?
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
We have our babies?
Am I too late?!
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
Yeah.
Oh, we have our babies.
Oh, I never could do it.
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
It does sound appealing.
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Why would you say that?
What?
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
You're good. You're good!
Yeah, that's what I said.
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Okay, errrr, Monica?
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Hey! What's going on?
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Hey, Danny!
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Salad.
I'll get our seats.
Okay.
I'll join you.
Okay. So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.
Yeah?
It's called the cherry.
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
It's the-Chandler!!
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Okay! See you later!
Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
Turns out he is kinda funny.
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
You don't have it anymore?
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
You're look for laughable...
So, are we going in there?
I am!!
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over...
Umm, yeah-no thanks.
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
You okay? You all right?
Oh, no thanks.
No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
So we should probably get going soon.
Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
Alright, we'll share.
No.
Give them to me.
No, give me the...
Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
Ohh, brisk tonight.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh man.
Let's never speak of this.
That can be arranged.
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Let's reset.
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
You're a genius, Ross.
Ahh, nooo!!
Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp.
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow.
You want me to sing?
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.
I can't sleep now.
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Would you like to see them?
They're so small!
Great!

Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Mmm.

Um-hum, you're jealous.
I know what your problem is.
Oh you do, do you?
Of... of what?
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Hey, ready for dinner?
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
Ooh, absolutely!
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
If that helps you.
Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
Like a pirate?!
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
So is Joey around?
Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
I can't imagine why.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
Youre doing it again.

I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
Then uh, what's-what's this?
Hi! What's going on?
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
It's gonna be so great.
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
But Phoebe...
Yeah! Yeah, we can!
That is so cool.
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
That's too bad.
There y'go. Ross?
Yeah.

Thanks for your help.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?

No.
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Oh, what a fun office.
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
Well, she has issues.
....Are we still talking about sex?
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
Does she.
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
What is it, Tim?
No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.

Transplant.
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
You mean they're lovers.
That's funny. Who are they?
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
If you wanna put a label on it.
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
That dies with me.
More of Grandma's teramisu.
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
So will I.
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Doctor Ross Geller.

Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
To the Bings!
Take thee, Emily...
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...

He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Well, he's doing terrible!
You don't wanna know.
No, I really, really do.
Really!
Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
You don't think I'm cute?
Hi.
Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
No, let me finish.
Hey, you listen.
No, no, let me finish.
No, you let me fini...
Hi.
Eight whole days.
No, I do not hear that.
...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...
That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
Awesome!
To get my coat.
I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
No no no.
Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
No, don't worry about it.
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
No, you could've lost your job.
Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
Well, this all looks good.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Great.
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
Thanks, any suggestions?
No.
Whoa. That was really good.
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
Oh my God, I'm late.
Thank you.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
Okay.
Yes, Waltham interiors.
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Who?
Is there something wrong?
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Joey...
All right, on the table.
Hi!
Monica! Hi honey.
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
Do you still work here?
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
It's this way? Sorry.
No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Who's party is it?
Where is this party?
Here in Chelsea.
A woman's
What woman?!
Oh, no!! No, no!
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Well, are any of those people here?!
Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
Hey, everybody!
Don't be too long.
Okay, well g'night.
Good night.
Okey-dokey!
There is not one hair on that head.
Dance with your father.
Dance with him.
Mom, I'm hungry.
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
Alright.
Uh, may I help you?
Excellent!
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
I know! I can't wait!
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
Were you're parents happy, or something?
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Hi.
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
And Joey.
Hey!
Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.
Yeah, but even soo.
Mark!!
It's okay, Rachel knows.
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
You're good. You're good!
Why would you say that?
'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?
Tomatoes are squishing.
Okay.
Gotta keep squishing.
Okay.
Op.
Yep. Pretty much.
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
So, you and Angela, huh?
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Huh, I never really noticed.
Went out with Joey.
Good morning Rachel.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
You can't leave! I have your shoe!
Rachel has those in burgendy.
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
That I was not expecting.
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Oh. Thanks.
Chicken or small?
What's goin' on?
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Why aren't you at home in bed?
Well of course I am!
Oh, thanks.
But you're spittin' all over me man!
You know you've been spitting on me?!
That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
All right, hang on!
Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
Noooo!!
Pass the cheese, please.
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
Take thee Ross...
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...
I, Emily...
Take thee Ross...
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
What are you doing here?!
Then don't break in!!
I'm sorry.
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
What?!
What's he talking about?
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Way to be cool, man.
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
I'm the supply manager.
Why don't we do a trial run.
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
We don't need any toner.
How does it happen?
They don't?
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
I don't need any toner.
So it's just your mother then.
Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
Not me.
Yeah. How 'bout that.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
Oh my God, you're a freak.
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
I really can't say.
I'll be in in a minute.
Oh, yeah... yeah.
Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .
Goodnight.
No dear. It's not.
What?
I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
Thank you! Good meeting you.
Yes! Yes! You did!
Actually, I should get going.
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
Oh...
What is wrong now?!
What are you guys doing?!
Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
Oh.
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game!
Cool! I'll catch up!
It's lovely to meet you.
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
So are you his mother or his father?
Jack!
Oh, we have our babies.
We have our babies?
Yeah.
Oh my God.
You did it, man.
Oh, I spilled some.
Wine?
Please.
I got it.
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
Who is this?
Here comes the bride.
Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!

Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Hey, Weird Girl.
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Hey, Lizzie.
I brought you alphabet soup.
Did you pick out the vowels?
Oh, I couldn't eat now.
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Chicken? Chicken boy!

My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..
You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
What's wrong, sweetie?
That's sweet. Could I take her?
With this ring? No contest.
Nothing, nothing.
Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.
What-what's going on?!
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.

Hi.
How could I forget?
Ross.

Yes, yes I was.
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
Yeah. See?
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.

You are so beautiful.
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
No! I mean he's nice.
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
Yeah.
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
My fish, Buddy.
Where's Buddy?
Buddy?
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
No! Sam Waterston!

Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Sorry. You look beautiful.
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
What?
Oh.
You know what, that's it, that's it.
Son of a bitch!
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
You, get out of my shop!
What is wrong now?!
Yes! Yes! You did!
Oh...
This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then...
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
That's great! That's wonderful!
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
We have got to move!
Good night!
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
Oh, that is so not true.
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Oh, it is.
It isn't.
We never get smacked.
What is with him?
With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
It's a curling iron.
Well I just thought...
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
It's clean.
This is a great picture.
Wow!
Here it comes.
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
Here, let me help.
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Ooh, this always happens.
Thank you.
You-you have a very beautiful... eye.
Five oh dollars.
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
What?
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
That's great.
Take thee, EM-I-LY...
I think we'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross...
I, Ross...
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Why? What you'd do?
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Least of all you.
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
You really need the bassinet?
Like a hound?
Not a basset, a bassinet.
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.
Ohh, I thought that you....
Judy, the kids..
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
It wasn't my decision!
Joey.
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Good luck, babe.
Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.
You don't say!
Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
Okay.
Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime.
He's Bobby Bobby?
Well that's his last name.
And his first name.
It's Robert Bobby.
Oh.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
And-and a power tie?
This hummus is great.
Good for you.
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
God bless the chickpea.
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
What happened to the library?
So! How's the library?
Ugh, museum.
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
No, I wanna melt it.
Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
Yeah!
I knew it, wow!!
You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Oh my God, so do I!
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Ohh, so cute.
Whad'ya mean no?
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
No. no.
No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
Get my glasses too.
Bye! See you later!
Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
See ya.
Fun Bobby is so great.
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
Okay, I bought a boat.
Rach?
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
You bought a boat?
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Okay. Let's do it again.
All right, let's try one.
Hmm, noodle soup.
Okay.
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
How do you know Frank?
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
Yeah. Frank.
Well, go ahead Rachel.
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
I beg your pardon?
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
You have a son?
Because I'm in love with you.
I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
And why exactly would I do that?
What?!
Yeah, I'm all...in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
Oh yes, there you are.
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Goodbye Geller.
Oh, hi. It's Mark.
That would be great. Thank you.
Hello!
Oh.
What? Is it my breath?
We'll go to a hotel.
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Who-ah-ho.
We'll go to a hotel.
No you won't.
Get my glasses too.
Whad'ya mean no?
No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
My parents are dead.
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
I know. I like it up here.
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
It's so secluded up here.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
Yeah! Punch him!!
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
I say, punch him Joey.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow.
You're a genius, Ross.
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Okay.
Okay, bye!!
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Yeah, it is.
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
Ohh that's so sweet!
Yes you did! What was it?
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
Dr. Geller!
Some day, maybe.
No, I'm not.
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Funny book?
Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
What?! Anything! Anything!
Ohh, I'm sorry.
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Okay. I'll be right back.
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
What are you doing here?!
You don't have, anything?
Well ah, what can you swing?
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
You have really great hair.
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
Good morning!
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
A moustache comb.
I have a little comb.
Oh. And what do you call that?
Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
No.
I'm Chandler's new roommate.
Who are you?
Hi, I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.
I-I-I don't think so.
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
It was, wasn't it?
Well, thanks again for lunch.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
The food there was, was great.
Wasn't it?
You mean dying man?
Yeah, okay.
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
Yes!
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
Hey! What are you doing here?
Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
Are those your teeth??
Okay.
Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?
Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Yes. They're insanely white.
Oh yes there is!
Ah-ha! Too cocky!
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
That was an accident! And so were you.
And who is your friend?
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
Oh, they're a hoot.
I'm-I'm Monica.
Monica! Where are you from?
Its a little complicated.
Carol, not me.
Err, right.
A little.
But were fine.
How hot are we?
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Woohoo!
You wanna buy a car?
No.
Oh! That was Lambchop!
Oh, God!
Okay..
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
No! I went with Mindy.
No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
Me?!
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
He's not here right now.
Can I help you?
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
I don't want to talk about it.
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
Of course, what happened?
Okay, umm...
But you know what might really cheer me up?
You're Erwin's daughter?!
Ahh, yes.
Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter!
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?
Thomas, come back here!
Hey, I'm trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!!
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
I have no idea.
Don't talk to me now!
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Everything okay in there?
Awww, just like his daddy.
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
You did a bad thing!
Uh-huh.
We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
Yes, I did.
Very bad!
Meet me in the bathroom.
I want you right here, right now.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
I'm going to the bathroom now.
C'mon.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Hi!
Hey.
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Yeah, they're not so bad.
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
Am I too late?!
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Okay, keep saying it!
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
We have our babies?
Susan and I live together.
Like lovers.
You know how close women can get.
Although I was married to her.
Carol, not me.
That's great! Hey! Excellent!
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
I got the job!
Oh, God bless us, everyone.
Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
Girls, sit down.
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
Thank y...
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
That's terrible! I'm sorry!
He shot a bird!
Oh that is over!
Phoebe, are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
Actually, I should get going.
Here you go.
Thanks!
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
Yes! Yes! You did!
Alright. What's the message?
No no no! Federal regulations!
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
Uh... I don't know.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Then, what's the problem?
All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
It was.
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
Well, thanks for the books.
It's a...
No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan...
All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
Well, up yours too!
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
What?!
Oh, that's not what it means?
You gotta take the canoe!
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
Hola! Hello. Hello?
It was, it was her voice.
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Okay. That was her right?
Definitely.
Come on. I want to know.
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
Mmm-Unmm.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Oh, I love you too. But...
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
No but, no but.
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
Let's take it from there.
Let's reset.
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
What's going on over here?
Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
And where is your hat?
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Ahh that's the 2 points.
Oh, just years of experience.
Cut!
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Can I get some ice here?!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
No, I'm picking you up.
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
No, I'm alright man. Really.
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
Um-hmm, five actually.
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Okay, now I'm really late.
I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
Okay.
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
Bye.
Hey baby, I'm back...
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
Come in.
Hey Ryan, what's up?
What's goin' on?
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
Come on! Speech!
Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
I think it's necessary.
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
Could you guys help me?
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
It-it's really heavy.
I know a great little place.
Hey, you like pizza?
Oh, that's sounds great.
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
I wish I didn't have to go.
I love both of you!
Yeah?
Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
Ohh, Ross, please!
Is it dry in here?
Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Hey, where's the chicken?
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Oh, okay. Here you go.
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Great. I'll see you later!
Monica, you asked the question.
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
I know! I know! I know!
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
I'm just taking you outside!
Okay lady, you're out of here.
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
Oh, okay.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Way to go, Phoebe!
Oh, jeez.
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
That cold makes you sound so great.
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
Show me in the table.
Who are you?
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Uh, no, Susan and me.
Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
Oh, you and me?
The other us.
Ok.
Were you following me?
What are you doing?
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
This will be your phone.
It could happen.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
No you answer it and take pledges.
Yeah. From the top?
Yeah.
You wanna try it again?
Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
Ok.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Don't, I like it dirty.
Uh, sure, why not.
Pecan sandy, just made em.
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
Oh yeah. See you guys.
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
Oh.... my... God.
You owe me a cat.
Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...

So Ross, what your problem?
I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
Eh-wh-Excuse me?
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
I could play the oboe!
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
You don't play the oboe!
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
Who are you?
I'm wearing two belts.
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
Are you drunk?
No!
Yeah! That would be great!
I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
Yeah, and maybe that you're a real
I'm sorry?
Bite me, blondie!
I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
It's the basketball playoffs.
There's a game?
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
Hey, can I ask you something?
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
Sure.
Where are we?
Come on, touch it!
You wanna touch it?
Nooo, but it, but it's great.
Okay. You can feel all the bones in your skull.
Hi.
Right, okay, then no.
Yes! Phoebe.
That's my first name.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
Yay!
He told me in person.
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
But, he told me over the phone.
That's weird.
Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh!
Happy birthday sweetpea.
Just go.
Surprise.
Daddy.
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
It's okay, Rachel knows.
And wait, I've got something for you.
Mark!!
Yeah, but even soo.
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Pass it! Pass it!
He's open!
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
'Scuse me.
Hey Monica, it's Chip.
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Yesss!!
Who's Chip?
Uh-huh. G-good deal.
So, what's up?
Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
I'm sorry.
No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
Who are you talking too?
What?!
Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
I am not going to apologize to a tree!
If you want it to be.
Dude!
Is that an expensive blouse?
Here's your girlfriend's button.
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
Want us to go?
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Mmm hmmm.
Uh-huh.
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
Can I get you some coffee?
Rachel?!
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Hi, sure!
I will flip you for it.
Look, I dont see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
I see. So what do you propose to do?
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
On your back... Mom.
No, I mean it's not Geller.
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Thank you!
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
That's just the way it is.
Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
Well, how-how come?
That's crazy.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
Look I just thought that...
Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Speech! Come on Monica!
Pheebs!!
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Come on!
Come on! Speech!
Yeah, they're out of town.
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
Your parents'?
Ohh.
Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
She's supposed to be with you.
Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
No. It's the one he's licking.
You're good.
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
It's a bathing suit?
Ross, are you okay?
Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
To wear in front of people?
Is that supportive?
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
Fellas, these guys were here first.
Sorry.
There you go.
We kinda need to talk.
Oh he knows! For the most part.
Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
Both of you together?
Wh-what's up?
Oh.... my.... God.
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
Hey, it's Janice.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Santa's mad at me.
No Santa? Was I bad?
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
So Santa's coming?
Just tell me the truth.
Where are we?
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Do you have any tissues?
Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Okay!
It's nice to have a boyfriend.
Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.
And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one and only boyfriend...
Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
I know that.
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
I finally got my band!
Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
Three babies?
We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
Hey! What's up?
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
I know!
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
No, no that was the first.
I did.
Does it always, uh--?
Keep singing! Keep singing!
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Is that supposed to be me?
You're so welcome.
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
Yeah.
Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
I am Father Kalebasous.
Okay.
Who is this?
He's Greek Orthodox.
As are you...
She may have died?
What's going on?
She may have died.
We're looking into it.
I, uh, I'll go see.
What's the matter with him?
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
I think he's stoned again.
What?
Happy Valentine's Day!
Each.
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Yeah, sure. Good luck!
All right.
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
I know I couldn't. So....
Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
Watch the thorns!
Minsk. It's in Russia.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Minsk?
I know where Minsk is.
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
It's, uh, it's Paul.
What, like there's a rule or something?
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
Who's Paul?
Hello! Who's in there?
Ohhh!!
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
How ya doin'?
Who in the hell are you?
Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
It's textbook.
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Hey, how long are you in the city?
Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
So you guys want coffees?
Yeah.
Thank God! I'm exhausted!
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
Yeah, me too.
Oh that's me, I gotta go.
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
Oh uh, o, OK.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
No-no-no, the kiss was good.
Horrible!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Okay!
No, but that's bad!
Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
I want you to move in with me.
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, get out! Now!
Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
Yeah, leave!
Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
That won't be necessary.
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Ugh!
And you knew about this?!
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
I'm him.
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Oh, am I on the radio?
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.
No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.
I think we have an answer.
What is this place?
Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
Whats she doing here?
This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.
You were amazing out there.
Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
Oh my God!
I will go for that drink.
So, do we have the best friends or what?
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Each.
So this is it? Victor?
Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
In a minute!!
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
So long, Vic!
Uhh, Rachel, my parents...
I know, I can do more than cook.
I like her. She sees smart.
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Hi.
Whats she doing here?
Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
I think we have an answer.
This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.
Think she got fired at Riffs?
Look, I. . .
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
It was Max's stuff.
Stay.
Getting so good at that!
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!
You remember Janice.
My god, what happened?
Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
Sure.
Wow! That would be great.
I'm sorry.
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
Really?
Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
I can't say.
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.
Was it her quarter?
She sells drugs to kids.
It was my quarter!
How about we talk about this over dinner?
Okay lady, you're out of here.
So, how ya doin?
Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
Huh?!
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Yeah, well..
Uh, is your name Chandler?
Excuse me.
Ahhhh.
Uh, yes, yes it is.
Chandler Bing?
Do I dare ask?
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
That sounds great. Same for me.
I think you've got concussion.
You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
I'm so happy that you're here.
Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
Ohh, thank you.
Here I am!
Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth's here! Who are you talking to?
Six dollars, please.
And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!.
Hi.
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
No, they're-they're all true.
All those things I said about not being ready...
They're not true?
Oh.
But...
I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry...
It's a rug.
Jill?
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Right! But, I am sorry.
Everybody has to audition.
Why would you think that?
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Fine. I don't like you!!
No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do?
Hi! What are you doing here?
Joey!
Hi!
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
He says he was too.
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
Interesting.
So I was wondering....
Where do I know you from?
Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
Ahh, ahh, excuse me.
Do you think he knew I was here?
Ohhh.
Yeah?
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .
Look at you. All jealous.
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done.
Okay, my next song's called Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
Sorry. You look good too.
So.
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
A lesbian?
I am Guru Saj.
You must be Ross.
Hi.
Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
You look very pretty today.

Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
What's going on?
You're an Aquarius, huh?
Yes I am.
Yeah.
I bet you're a Gemini.
Nope.
Don't, I like it dirty.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
That's your call.
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
The guy with the gas?!
Wow!
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Really?!
You must be so happy!
That's so great for you guys!
Yeah!
Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I'm feeling. Well....
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
Why? Are we done for the day?
That's what you told me.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
Is that my ass?
No, we are. I'm sad.
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
Okay.
Yes. Uh, can't you wait until tomorrow? All right. Unbelievable!!
Hey Joey! We're ready.
Mexico?
Yes! Very good.
Yeah! Me too.
Richard? We're ready for you. Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he's playing Vincent.
You asked him too?!
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
Hm-mmm.
Why?!
My God! You love me!
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
What?
Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I... I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have...
That's good. Very good!
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
Joey! Joey, good one!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
Oh. Good to see you guys.
It's good to see you
You're table's ready sir.
Yes.
Or if you prefer, this table is available.
Really? Well, in that case...
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
You got a problem with that?
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
It's-it's-it's almost dead!
Looks good. I'll take it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
Whoa! Big octopus.
He started mine first!
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um.
Hey, what kind of work do you do?
I'll just throw them out.
What?
Umm, you've got some on your pants.
These little women. Wow!
Your liking it, huh?
Wait! Hold on! Hi!
No, Joey!
Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...
Hi!
Okay, go ahead.
Are you wearing my glasses?
Yeah, like a chimney.
Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
All right, let's do it!
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Oh yeah.
No, no, no. What was that?
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Yes, it has a head!
Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
I see the head.
All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
Oh, you're sweet and cute.
So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
I know! That's why they trashed me!
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Tonight. What are you doing?
What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
When is she leaving?
I'm coming up!
Hey, mind if I use the phone?
Plate. Plate. Plate.
Uh, plate?
Plate! Yes, plate.
See, we don't need them.
Plate?
I know what your problem is.
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
Oh you do, do you?
Um-hum, you're jealous.
Wow! Well, welcome back!
Hey Pheebs! How's it going?!
Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack.
Yeah.
Hi Ross!
But my apartment is so...
Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
Umm, oh, hey, I don't know. How about a big one?
Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
Wait! Where's my shoes?
Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!
I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Uh-huh.
Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Yes, Papaya Extract.
Then why did she ask us to...
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Thank you!
So uh, have a great time down there.
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
Breakfast is near!
The dark of night has disappeared!!
Okay!
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Nice to meet you Mac!
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
This is like the temporary robot, right?
No. Why?
What? Is it my breath?
Oh, hi. It's Mark.
Oh.
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
More wine, dear?
...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
Huh.
Oh, I think so.
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Settle what?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
You don't even know me...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
Hey, hold on a second.
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
Oh hey, hey Mark.
Okay.
Hi honey!
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
Please.
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
Ah, just one other thing.
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Yes?!
I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
...No, we hate him.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
We're sorry.
Ma! What're you doing here?
Monica! I think Rachel's here!
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Er, yeah, it's mine.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Who? Me the attacker?
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them...
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Yes that's right.
Why?
See you later Rach.
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
Bye-bye Julie.
Hey.
Did you bring the toe?
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and-
But you're not. Okay, good.
Oh, yeah. I know that.
I so wanna be attracted to you.
I'm sorry.
Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad.
What's too much fun?
Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
Sorry, prom queen.
No!
Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
Ah! Nora Bing!
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Hey hey hey! She's on!
...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
Your mom was arrested?
I'll take a look at him.
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
Oh, thank you.
Michael.
Take 36 is up!
All right, from the top.
Scene 5, take 2.
All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?
Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
That's so great for you guys!
Do I know why we're rushing?
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Yeah!
You must be so happy!
Oh, come on! Come on!
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
No, not getting my bra!
Please!!
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
She broke my arm.
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
He touched my fanny.
No, she touched mine first!
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
What?!
Can I use your phone?
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
I don't think she'd like that.
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Aw-awww!
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
Oooooh...
You are an idiot. .
Why?
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
Well, that could take a while.
What about Julie?
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
I got the time to get to know Julie.
Is that true miss?
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.
Sells drugs to kids.
What?!
I'm in my boss's car!
I can't!!
Why not?!
What?!
Uh-oh, tunnel.
Hey you're in our seats.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
Yeah alright.
Oh, sorry we didn't know.
Hey, we were sitting there.
Okay. Oh no, I have to.
Okay.
Don't go.
Too bad, she's leaving.
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
So what did you do today?
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I think it is!
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
Oh, it looks great!
Oh, here they are right here.
No.
All right!
Oh good.
Thanks for your help.
I think he's stoned again.
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
What's the matter with him?
What?
What?
Right! But, I am sorry.
I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry...
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
She took all my stuff.
Wait! Where's my shoes?
But my apartment is so...
Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
Do I know why we're rushing?
We were just talking about you.
You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Hey.
Really?!
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Uh-oh, busted!
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
Hey, we were sitting there.
Hey you're in our seats.
Oh, sorry we didn't know.
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
Is that supposed to be funny?
Hi, how's it goin?
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
I did.
Her name's Debra.
Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
We were playing rugby.
Oh, Liam.
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
That's really a day shoe.
Wait! We need shoes!
Okay. Um, how about these?
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
He would like to kiss you.
Your eyes are very pretty.
Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over.
Oh.
I want you to move in with me.
Phoebe?
Yeah?
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
Joey Tribbiani, this is...
I'm sorry, why don't we do that right now? He's right here.
Okay.
Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
What if you put them here.
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
There's one thing missing.
And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Wow.
What's that?
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
You may kiss the bride.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
Yay!
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Just keep smiling.
So, this was uh, really fun.
Okay.
Rachel is my girlfriend.
Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
Need uh, need a little hand there.
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
That was you?!
Yeah! Okay, here you go.
Oh my God, are you guys okay?
Are you all right?
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Really?
Are you okay? What's wrong?
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
Sure!
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Well, whatever works for ya...
Wait! We need shoes!
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Okay. Um, how about these?
That's really a day shoe.
Really? You'll do anything?
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, I've got something you can do.
Chicken? Chicken boy!
Oh, I couldn't eat now.
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
Where are you Vic?
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
In a minute!!
So this is it? Victor?
Joe. How's it going?
Oh.
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
Good. Hey.
Hi.
So... We go eat.
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
Yes.
You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that.
Why would we be freaked?
We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and...
Oh.
Are you close with them?
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
No-no, they're not very nice people.
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Well, I don't think this, y'know.
You mean like watch?
No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
What about my friend Victor?
Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
Alright, let me just get my coat.
What are these, stitches?
Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
You owe me a waffle.
Saw Regis Philbin once...
Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Would you like to see them?
Oh my God.
You did it, man.
They're so small!
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Hey! You're a good dancer!
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Yeah!
Really?
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
So what are you guys out doing today?
No, the man is a mess.
Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
You're not just saying that are you?
Was he crying?
No.
How would you like to pay?
Okay, I can let it go at eight.
We stand firm at $10.
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
What like Pete Dakota?
And you're our age. You're our age.
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Would you like some gum?
See?
Huh.
Um, is it sugarless?
Sorry, it's not.
So you want to come inside?
Good.
I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
Yes. Yes I do.
I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
Are they, uh, firm?
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
They'r alright.
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
Are we ready to order?
Sorry, sorry.
Monica!
Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
You okay there, slugger?
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
What is with you tonight?
So umm, are we cool?
Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
Okay.
Okay.
I knew you'd understand.
It's not that weird, is it?
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
All right.
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
Who in the hell are you?
Hello! Who's in there?
How ya doin'?
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
Daddy cut me off.
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
Never mind, I got it.
And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
Okay, anytime.
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Oh, well I thought that ah...
Sure.
Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh...
Oh, you thought, huh? Yeah, well that didn't really work out too well for you did it you idiot!! What are you?! A moron!! Huh?! It says D-13! Okay?! Look you're surrounded by even numbers!! Did that give you some clue?!
Uh, the usher told us to come...
I'll never forget you Hans.
Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Fired! Why?
Are you yelling at me?!
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
God no!
Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
Y'know what, I should do it.
Yeah!
I mean you definitely should do that.
Yeah!
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
Oh damn, I hate that.
Actually, me too.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Oh, don't worry about it.
Umm, no, I don't think so.
Yeah.
Okay. Uh, huh. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
Can-can we take a look at your ticket?
Sure.
What's in the cup, Ross?
Whoa!!
Whoa, sorry Tommy.
Umm...
What is in the cup?!
Almost time for cake.
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
Who's drink can I freshen?
Mon, Mon, are you OK?
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Great. That would be fine.
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
Oh shout, that would have been fun.
Please, let me do something.
Would you like my tin-foil hat?
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
Okay.
Really! You-you sail?
Yeah, what's the gala for?
It's a uh, regatta gala.
No-no, but I support it.
Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night.
My joke wasn't funny.
Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Really?!
Great, I'll see you then.
So, are we gonna get together or what?
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Hey, thanks for talking to me.
You have all the answers, don't you?
Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just-I want you to be happy
Living with you would make me happy.
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Are you sure?
Okay, you guys free tonight?
Well, it's kinda dangerous.
Well, I like danger.
Yeah!!
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Sorry, members only.
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?
Me? No.
I wanna quit the gym.
It's okay man, be strong.
You picked a great couch.
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
Yeah?
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
You look beautiful this evening.
You're fake laughing too, right?
Oh, the tears are real.
Show me the badge again.
Shiny.
Is she gonna be all right?
Oh, ok.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Nice!
So, it's great to see ya.
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
Good, they feel good, in my head.
You too.
You too.
I'm actually the office manager.
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Well, was there anything else?!
Frank Jr. Jr.!!
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
Yes!
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
So gross!
Thank you so much for coming.
Susan! Hi!
Hey!
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
You used to be my babysitter.
Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
Do I know you?
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
I did. Now I'm the idiot.
All right.
All right, did you just say all right?
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
Rach! Come on! Rach!
Happy birthday!!!
Happy birthday!!!
It's your birthday!
Hey.
Are you remaking the bed?
What're you doing?
Just waiting for you sweetie.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
Then, you're redoing it because...
Because we can remember them.
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Well, sure, that too.
Actually they were Nana's.
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Thank you. They're yours.
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
So, see ya on Saturday.
Well we're gonna miss you around here.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, you bet.
Oh.
Somebody lose a ring?
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
I'm so worried about him, y'know?
Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
H-h-h-how's the duck?
I don't want you taking that thing.
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Who-ah-ho.
Well, was there anything else?!
I'm actually the office manager.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Sure! Umm, where are you from?
Philadelphia.
Where can I wash up?

All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Thank you.
Neither of us like Ross!
Then we agree?
Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so.
I like Ross.
Ohhh! Kids!
Whoa, you are very beautiful.
Oh, I got it.
Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
Oh, thank you.
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
We don't need any toner.
I'm the supply manager.
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
Okay, what was wrong with that call?
Ah, you... have the sex?
Thing?
Thing, yes. Thing.
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
Bed?
Normally, I would not do it.
Sure.
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
This almost never happens!
We're looking into it.
I, uh, I'll go see.
Now she's passed.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
I think we've seen enough!
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Yeah but I didn't read anything.
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
Hey, is Rachel here?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Please. This is so your fault.
How, how is this my fault?
Eight! Easy eight.
Come on eight.
Yes, yes eight.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
...the lullabye of...
Come on along and listen to...
Okay, Widow!
Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
All right. I'll get my bag.
Yeah, can I help you with something?
Let's go Phoebe!
And-and you're using my name!
Phoebe, come on!
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
Ross? What's with the neck?
What?!
Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that....
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
Phoebe! That's a great name.
You must be Hilda.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Okay. We'll be right back.
Uhh, not that I know of.
Humm, really?
Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
That - that's an idea.
So, Monica, what do you do?
Really?
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Good for you.
So! How's the library?
Um-hmm.
Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Ugh, museum.
What happened to the library?
Nobody. I was just practicing.
Rachel Green's office.
Tag? Hi, who was that?
Really?
Hi!
Hi! What-what're you doing here?
Hey!
Hi.
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
I thought it went very well.
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Daddy!
You're next!!
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
That'd be great, thanks.
Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Oh umm, uh we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?!
What, you don't think I know that?
All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
C'mon hurry, hurry.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.
Uh, it's the college playoffs.
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
Oh, then go Vassar.
Uh, they're not in it.
She took all my stuff.
Right! But, I am sorry.
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
That's the best one! Oh my God, thank you so much!
Well, if you don't, I will.
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
Please, I'm not going for anything.
Would you please go?
Night Mon. Night Julio.
Hi! Rachel Green's office.
Really?
Hi!
You must be Hilda.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
It's really nice to see you again.
Hi!
Come on in.
Thank you.
Oh Rachel, uhh...
Bing! That's a great name.
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Me too.
Monica! Where are you from?
And who is your friend?
I'm-I'm Monica.
New York.
I'm not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?
He touched my fanny.
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
She broke my arm.
No, she touched mine first!
That's my job!
When is Santa coming?
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Okay, it's not a contest.
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
No Santa? Was I bad?
Hey, where's his thing?
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Chandler's a girl!
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
We've come for her things.
No.
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
Ahh, no, I'm good.
Okay, have fun! Wooo!!
Come on see, she doesn't look that bad.
C'mon kid, let's go.
No, no, no.
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Ahh, are you hadsome.
Let's show 'em.
Thanks, see you at the party.
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
We have a ladle.
Okay, great!
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
Is there a Julio here?
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
I am Julio.
Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
When are you coming home?
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
Okay.
What? Guys, I'm not.
C'mon, this is us.
You want me to cancel it?
Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
Oh.
No! No!
Okay.
Say something..... hot.
Yes...
Ah....
Er.... um.....
What?
Why'd you freak out?
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
I did not freak out.
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
My breast milk is gross?
You had sex, didn't you?
Hey, Monica!
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
How do you do that?
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
One ticket to Yemen?
On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
Ok, you really want me out?
Yeah.
GET OUT NOW!!
Yes please.
Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.
Let's never speak of this.
Ohh, brisk tonight.
Oh man.
You got it.
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Uh, no not really. Why?
Sure.
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Are you funny?
I wish I could talk to her.
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
Yeah?
What are you in love with her or something?
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
Why aren't you at home in bed?
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
Ohh, ohh.
If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
It went under the table.
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
All right!
Cool! I'll catch up!
What are you guys doing?!
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game!
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
Huh?
It's open! Come in!
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
Hi!
Hi!
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
This is a great picture.
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Put your balloons down!
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh...
Attack!
You put your balloons down!!
You put your balloons down!!
How's the hired help?
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
What's this? Blue nail polish?
Oh! You know what I need?
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
Yeah!
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Well, I'm very glad you're here.
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
Oh, I wouldn't miss this.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Not so fast Wesley!
You've done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
Remoray!
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!
Yes, yes, do go on.
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Uhh...Shall I go on?
He better go on for what I'm paying.
After what he just said, you're paying for the whole bloody lot.
I had them made special.
I brought you something.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
That's fine.
Very nice. Very nice.
You ready to go?
Yeah.
So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
Sure! That would be nice.
Jen.
Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or...
Umm?
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
All right. This is the kitchen.
Ah well, this is the living room.
Impressive.
Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom?
The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
You've been married twice?
So you've just married the one time then?
Well umm...
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
I know, I know. Hello.
Hi Rob Dohnen.
I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
So how did everything go?
Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Well, we've gotta go.
Oh, who's this little guy?!
None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
Okay.
Oh! Ooh! Umm!
Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
All right. Okay. I'm starving!
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
Yeah!
You did a good thing today.
How you doin'?
Ok.
Yeah.
You wanna dance?
Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
You got porn!
Hello.
Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
Ohh great.
Come on over here, sweetheart.
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
Oh, that sounds great.
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
I-I-I'm leaving the show?
Oh that was a real person?!
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Who told you that?
Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice.
Sooo, you've been doing this long?
No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
Dude!
Is that an expensive blouse?
And some biscottie cookies.
Oh, thats good.
All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
Good choice.
Definitely her.
Oh my God. I think you're right.
So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
Oh, Liam.
Oh that was a real person?!
I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
I-I-I'm leaving the show?
It's not that kind of anniversary.
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Ah! Oh.
Sooo!! Anyway...
He went out for groceries.
Yeah. What?
Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
Ok so will he be back soon?
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
Howard's the handy man!
Oh, okay, I get it.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Yes but too me he's just, man.
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
No, I mean happy.
Scared? Happy?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
I know! I can't wait!
Then uh, what's-what's this?
Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
Rachel! Could I have a moment?
Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Okay.
Yes.
I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London-well Shropshire really but y'know-well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening?
Looks good. I'll take it.
Christmas cookie?
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
It's-it's-it's almost dead!
Nothing! It's an expression.
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
What's that supposed to mean?
No it's not.
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
No, I just thought it was cute.
Hey Joey.
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Ohh. Like what?
These got left for ya.
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Yeah.
Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
Hello?
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
It's okay. Come, come on in.
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
We learned how to dance.
Right.
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Yeah!
Worth a shot, huh?
Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
Look at this.
These are from Halloween three years ago.
This could've been hers!
Sure!
Right? And this! She-she could've won this!
Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
Then don't break in!!
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?!
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
Well, I never call me.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
I came to give you this and this.
We're sorry.
Ma! What're you doing here?
Oww! Big ring!
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Oh, just updating the phonebook.
Hi, Phoe.
Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
So we can go out again?
That's totally understandable.
Don't worry about it.
Oh yeah!
Absolutely!
You have three new messages.
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
Hi, this is Richard.
Not any more!
Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
Well, what was supposed to happen?
You really don't seem like you do. That's...
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
He says he was too.
Interesting.
Breathe, breathe, breathe...
Yeah, listen...
Out!
Oh, no.
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Hmm, noodle soup.
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Oh, what did I say?
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
All right, let's try one.
Hockey! Hockey! Hockey.
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
Oh! Yeah!
Rachel?
Oh my God!
One, two, three...
Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
Yes.
Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.
Oh, that's not what it means?
Well, up yours too!
What?!
No! No! That's-that's time-out!
Sorry.
You're right. It was 37.
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
Ah no. I don't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
I mean you're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
That's right.
So uh, who's your photographer?
Oooh it's getting close!
Yeah!
Jeffery.
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
No. No, you're not a loser.
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Look at me!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
All right, see ya Pheebs.
This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
Monana was very brave.
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
No way. No way did you do this.
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
Okay. Will you marry me?
This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
We're still on this side of the door.
Um-hmm.
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
So um, who was she?
So when are you getting married?
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th.
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
Oh May 15th.
Oooh it's getting close!
Is that supposed to be funny?
Hey, we were sitting there.
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
No actually, I was just going for colorful.
What's with this guy?
No one likes a buttmunch.
Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!.
Hi.
That's about 60 cents.
Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that.
Why, how much is that?
Every night!!
You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
By being in a box?
Why not? What's going on?
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
Joey, had reasons.
They were threefold.
Making out in your office.
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Shh! Of course, why don't we go inside?
Oh-ooh!
I know. That's what I told her.
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
Really.
Yeah.
You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
Oh please!
Um, thank you for the gift.
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .
Goodnight.
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
We're uh, we're getting married.
The other us.
Ok.
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
Which is bad, because?
You wanted to see me?
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Your... excuse me?
We agreed on Minnie.
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
Julia..
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Ah actually, that is mine.
Adios.
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
I want you right here, right now.
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
Meet me in the bathroom.
Miss? May I help you?
What the? What...
Hi!
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Can I change a hundred?
I understand that would be difficult.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
I don't know, it's just...
What do you mean, your seat?
Yes?
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
I mean, I was sitting there.
But, you got up!
What does he look like?
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
Oh, look at that.
Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
Really?
Just the last two pages.
Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
All right.
I found the picture!
Nobody sees the king!
Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
Hey! You can't go back there!
Alrighty. From the top.
They're your backup singers... beind you.
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
Why don't you try to do-
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.

What's wrong?
Well, I'm not gonna talk because...
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
Damnit Carl!
Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
So, so, did you hear?
Oh, hello Ross!
Susan...
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
All right, let's try one.
Hmm, noodle soup.
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
Hmm, noodle soup.
Okay. Let's do it again.
So ah, we on for tomorrow?
Okay.
You're our age!
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
Yeah, kinda.
Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
Okay. No. But thanks.
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
This is a glaucoma test.
Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Sit down.
Hey hey, come on in!
Need a new table.
You think?
Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
So you wanna get some dinner?
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Oh my God!
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
What's happening to your accent?
Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
It does sound appealing.
Tell me about it!
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Oh, I never could do it.
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Who's that?
Nobody.
Ohhh! Put it out!
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Monica, wake up. Monica.
Oh.
You know what, that's it, that's it.
What's up?
I thought of a thing.
Ohh, it's a bit small.
Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?
Yes.
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
It was.
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
You must be so happy!
Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I'm feeling. Well....
Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Probably kill myself!
But they're not here yet!
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
All right, honey, time to start pushing.
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
Oh, god.
You're table's ready sir.
Yeah, I'll sit down.
It's good to see you
Oh. Good to see you guys.
Yes.
Five dollars a box.
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
And what is second prize?
A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
No, you can't use your watch.
Whad'ya mean?
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Ok.
Or your keys.
Ok, just one more point.
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Score! Now can we go?
See, that's why we don't let her play.
I'll see you after work sweetie.
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
Okay. Bye!
So, what movie should we see?
I guess we just keep dancing.
God. I love you.
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
I say, punch him Joey.
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
Yeah! Punch him!!
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
Bye!
Who is it?
Oh my God.
I want to talk to you about your review.
I just, I thought Joey was there.
Really?!
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
What do you mean?
I suppose mainly sexual.
What?!
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
...Hm.
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Then...who did?
Uh-huh.

Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
So glad you brought someone.
Nice to see you Rachel.
Oh, hi!
Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department.
Oh, hi.
So it's just your mother then.
You don't secretly smoke do you?
No!
Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
I don't need any toner.
How about Mama Lisettie's?
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
Enh. Sure!
I wonder how long that milk has been setting out.
A film in Guadalajara!
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
The airport?
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
How did you know we were here?
Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth's here! Who are you talking to?
Uh, you guys?
Umm...
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Oh my God!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Thank you! Good meeting you.
No dear. It's not.
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
All right. I'm a total pro!
Hello?
What in the name of hell?
What is that?
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Hey!
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
Oh, you're a grandpa.
I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.
I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
Bon giorno tutti!
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
What stupid thing did you do?
Ewww!
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Step aside, ladies!
Look, Phoebe!
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
What're you gonna do?
Just a small tranquiliser.
Yes, what's the name, please?
May I help you ladies?
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
Emily Waltham.
Yes! I have it right here. Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
So, can I get some candy?
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
4:00 A.M.
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
Hey! Hiya!
Hey! Hey, cute jacket!

Hey-hey, what are those?
Oh, well, I'll show you around.
Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
What do you need help for?
And um, excuse me, he helps me.
Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
Oh God!
Oh, boy, do they suck.
Knick fan?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
No, it really should be burgundy.
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Huh, I never really noticed.
Yep. Pretty much.
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Monica, Monica is great.
I just sold it to that gentleman.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
Rachel?
Would you like to call somebody?
There you go!
You're definitely scaring here.
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
Hello?
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Okay.
Good. I should really start wearing hats!
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.
Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Umm, I thought about you all day.
Hello Joey.
Hey, Felicity.
Yeah.
Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.
Rachel didn't you just light that?
Absolutely!
I am so on board!
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
That's Carol with your son!
Well that's ambitious.
Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
Ross!
Is everything all right, dear?
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Oh my God..
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
How we doing, you guys ready?
Oooh it's getting close!
So when are you getting married?
Oh May 15th.
Yeah!
So uh, who's your photographer?
Ohh! Didn't know! Okay!
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
Okay! Ohhh no!
I'm sorry sweetie, it's the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
All right, let's move on.
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Okay then.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Oh, good. Thisll be fun.
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Alrighty. Were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why dont you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummys head.
What? What? What?
Is your back feeling better?
Oh great!
Yeah.
Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Kristen?
God bless the chickpea.
Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
This hummus is great.
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
Jack, would you let it go?
Dad, you really don't want to do that.
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
Well, it's nice to know that you...
Hey!
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!

My whole family's from Naples!
Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie...
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
So, who's the lucky guy?
Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I'm blind!
Oh... Uh...
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Well, she saw the ring.
I'm not allowed to have soda.
Okay.
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
What's a virgin?
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Look, you don't want to fight me.
And now you'll see me buying it.
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Well y'know, he's got access.
I have a feelin'... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.
How do you know?
Yeah.
Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know?
You're an excellent patient!
I gotta tell you, you look great now.
You look great too.
So how does it look?
Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
Well, thanks again for lunch.
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
It was, wasn't it?
Ross, take me off speakerphone.
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Hi.
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
You put your balloons down!!

Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
Oh yeah we do. C'mon.
Oh.
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Over here dad.
Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
I know.
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
Nothing I do means anything, really.
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
Hi, how are ya?
What do you, what do you think?
I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
Oh my God!
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Your last roommate's kidney?
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
No, no, no. What was that?
Oh yeah.
All right, let's do it!
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Well, people!
It is off. Right Ross?
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
You always said I'd make it.
Thanks.
Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
I missed you. I'm gonna get changed.
Yeah. So how have you been doing?
Hang on.
I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!
I, umm, shut up!
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
Well, my goodness, what was that?
Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
You thought I was Rachel?
Um, coffee to go, please.
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak.
Thank you.
Isabella Rosselini.
Are you serious? Oh my God.
And look where they're sitting.
Do you say this stuff to girls?
Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
Well, my nose got lonely.
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
Hi, I'm Lisa.
Yeah, they still wear underwear.
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Isn't he an architect now?
OH MY GOD!!!
WHAT?!!
Yes you did! What was it?
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Umm, no. No.
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
Ohh that's so sweet!
Well, what do you want me to say?
What, that's it?
"See you around?"
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
Alright, I'll call you.
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
According to recent findings!
Mitzi is.....
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
Oh, I didn't, I didn't know that.
Yeah?
Well y'know 'cause Rachel and I used to go out.
Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh...
I think we're here.
Well ah, what can you swing?
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
You don't have, anything?
Do you want a date Saturday?
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Yes please.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
Ross!
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!

This is really hard for me to say.
No. No, that's- that's okay.
...I feel a little sneezy And now I-
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
That guy's going home with a note!
She's not making me uncomfortable.
There's nobody here!
Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
Do you want me to quit?
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
I'll remember that.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Oh.
But how about tomorrow?
I had a really nice time tonight.
Hey!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Well, here it is.
OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
No. Have you seen David?
Phoebe. Hi.
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
No, no, he hasn't been around.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
OK, everyone gather up.
Got it!
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
'Scuse us
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
Hey! You can't go back there!
Nobody sees the king!
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
Oh my God.
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
You told me you didn't see anything.
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much.
I tell ya a lot things!
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
Did you pick out the vowels?
Hey, Weird Girl.
I brought you alphabet soup.
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
Saltines?
All right. I'll get my bag.
...the lullabye of...
Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
Good.
I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
Can I see your license please?
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
Oh my God.
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Your license?
Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Who-who else is in vice up there?
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
No, I don't know him.
I have nothing to do with casting.
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
So what're you guys gonna eat?
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
Here are the audition scenes.
Why don't we start right now!
Okay.
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Why would you think that?
I am supposed to be the mommy?
Alrighty. Were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why dont you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummys head.
What? What? What?
Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Look, I dont see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
I'm Joey! How are you doin'?!
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
Who the hell are you?!
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!

Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
Lemonade? You ok man?
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
So, would you like any dessert?
Fruitflies?
Yes! Thank you.
No! No dessert, just a check, please.
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
WHAT IS IT?!
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
So, so youre here too?
Hi, its us.
Right, and its me.
Much as you are.
Your turn.

Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh.
Thanks.
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
How do you do. Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! Did they have representation?
No-no I heard! I'm just sorry.
I'm sorry?
Bakersfield!
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
So, I hear, you hate me!
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
Hey.
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
So you watched the movies huh?
He's kind of intense huh?
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
A little what?
Well then we'll get wet.
It's perfect.
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
Pheebs?
Honey, it isn't good luck.
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
Oh my God! Monica!
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
Oh yeah, of course you don't!
No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
No.
'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
Totally and completely healthy!
So, I got the results of the amnio today.
Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
Oh, that's great, that is great!
Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Monica!!!
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
Well...
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Regular or decaf?
Ah, which ever is closest.
I tell ya a lot things!
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much.
You told me you didn't see anything.
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
Stay well.
Working with blind kids.
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
What were you doing in Africa?
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Rachel has those in burgendy.
You can't leave! I have your shoe!
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
Well, they don't have to know that...
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Yeah.
I gotta friend named Mark.
This is huge, you can buy me beer.
I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
That'll work too.
Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Hello, Paul.
Hi, Paul, is it?
Stop!
No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
Yeah, what's the gala for?
You are?
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
It's a uh, regatta gala.
Really! You-you sail?
On your back... Mom.
I will flip you for it.
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Your eyes are very pretty.
He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'
Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here.
Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
He would like to kiss you.
Alright, fine. I'll call you back.
I'm talkin'!
I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Good.
Isn't it a beautiful wedding?!
Ross, sweetheart!
Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Come in!
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
So is Joey around?
Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
I'm a dancer.
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
Oh, hey let me.
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Okay, I'll see you in our room.
Thanks a million.
Oh, you're welcome a million.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Where did you get this number?
Who is this?
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.
I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
Yes we are. So, coffee?
We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
Are we really in Montreal?!
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
I don't know, I don't have my jammies.
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Well, maybe you don't need them.
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
We're on in 3, 2,
Come on man! You've been here all day!
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
Here he comes! Hurry!
Got it.
All right.
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
Hey! Don't be a baby!
Do I know why we're rushing?
Wait! Where's my shoes?
You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
That's so great for you guys!
Please, please take him too.
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
Come on, lady!
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
Hello! One marriage please!
Nice to meet you Monica. Bing!
Hi, nice to meet you!
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
No, sir.
You really didn't have to. Wow.
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .
Hey Monica, how's it going.
Monica?
I guess that's how.
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
Oh hi!
Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..."
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
I'm starving!
No you do. You... just...
So, you look great.
Right.
What?
You've got panties stuck to your leg.
You're our third call tonight.
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
Really?
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
Wait. I wanna show you something.
Why?
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
What is it?
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
That's funny. Who are they?
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
You mean they're lovers.
No, pretty much just a towel.
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
And-and a power tie?
Oh God.
So you guys want me to take this back?
I know. I'm mad at me too.
Ohh, so cute.
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Hey! Me too!
You have all the answers, don't you?
Why?
Because, uh-it has to.
Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
Hey, thanks for talking to me.
I know, it's horrible isn't it?
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
I just hope...
Well, in a nutshell. . .
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
So, um, have you told your parents?
You told me I was the only one.
Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
It's not what you think, that was...
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
I don't speak English.
You did a minute ago!
Fine!
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
What? Alright, what about my two?
Oh honey, I'm fine.
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Right, and...
Oh hey! Here they are!
Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Okay. Cool.
Elizabeth!
Call me!
Please, can't you help me out?
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
So ah, Monica ready yet?
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
Right. Could you sign this?
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
I got a little drunk...and naked.
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
What?
Bob here.
What've you been up to?
Oh, is he hungry already?
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
I guess so.
You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
Oh, well that's not so crazy.
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
I'm just easing you in.
Oh, alright.
Bread. Aren't you a chef?
Salad.
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
Oh.
Hey! Rachel!
Well, you certainly own that room.
Okay. Okay.
Nice!
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Hi.
Well, here's your phone doctor.
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
That's what we were off doing.
Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
We uh, we just cooked it up.
Hi.
Hey.
Cool! I-I'll see you then.
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
All right.
All right, it's time to act, my talking props.
Yeah, um, may we help you?
Oh, okay, oh.
Oh.
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Hey!
Hey!
And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Hi.
Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Excuse me?
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
More of Grandma's teramisu.
Of course! It's her favorite.
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
That dies with me.
Never mind, it's open.
It's Erica.
Ah, the stalker.
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Let's get out of here.
Can I please see your face?
If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
Hi Phoebe.
OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
Yeah it is. . . what?
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
You slept with another woman?
Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
Okay, done.
All right then, it's settled.
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
Yes! Hell yes!
Okay.
I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
I'd really rather talk to him.
I was going to call him, but...
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
Oh.
I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
How you doin there squirmy?
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
Forget about it.
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
Are you interested in this ring?!
8,600.
We will give you $10.
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Okay, I can let it go at eight.
So ask me what I did today.
Ah, which ever is closest.
Okay.
So what did you do today Pete?
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
Hi, thanks for coming in again.
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
The one with "Heston" on it.
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
Interesting.
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
Screw it! I'm having one.
There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
I can't believe this!
Hey Chandler!
Hey!
Are you talking about having sex?
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Normal.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Well she said she had to think things over.
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Well all right, one thing happened?
Can he handle the stick?
And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
Yeah!
Oh well...
I can handle the stick!!
You are gonna be fine, believe me.
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
Right.
Uh-oh...
Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Yeah, she was my best teacher.
Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
And he was my best student.
Ohhh.
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
Its Phoebe! Hi!
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now Im here.
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
We're the Cobras!
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
I'm right here!!!!
Earl! I'm Phoebe.
I really like waking up with you.
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
That would be great!
According to recent findings!
Um, would you like to come in?
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
Mitzi is.....
Well that's wonderful. . . I
A real doctor?
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
Mom, it's OK.
It is Judy.
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
I'm Chandler's new roommate.
I-I-I don't think so.
But, he told me over the phone.
He told me in person.
I'd love some juice. Thanks.
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
Alright, let's take this outside.
Don't play with his things.
I know.
Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
Someone I can spoil, y'know?
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Really?
Sp-spoil?
Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
Okay, now I've really have to go!
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Ready, Annabelle?
You bet. Maybe some other time?
Don't you have to use the bathroom?
Ginger.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
Someone in here.
Um, would you like to come in?
Okay.
Huh...
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
According to recent findings!
You're gonna do what to my clocks.
Thank you.
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
I'm gonna set them to my time.
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
Just aim for the bump.
Anytime you're ready.
Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Why not? What's going on?
Chandler?
Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
By being in a box?
I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
One ticket to Yemen?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Are you travelling with a child?
Hope you had a nice flight.
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Ohh, it was the best!
I think the check in is that way.
No, you've got to whip it.
OK.
Ready?
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
Thank you.
Wait! You forgot your legs!
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Push, push!
We're here!
No help required Chico.
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
You want some help.
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
Is this guy great or what?
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Yeah, yeah he is.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Dr. Burke will see you know.
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
Can you be my dancing partner?
Yeah, I've got something you can do.
What, what is it?
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
His dancing partner?!
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
No. No.
Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
Hi.
I am not telling you guys anything.
C'mon, tell us.
Yeah, is she really 20.
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.
Dad, you really don't want to do that.
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
That's the whole part?
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Oh, excuse me.
More turkey Mr. Chandler?
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Sorry I'm late, what's up?
Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
He went out with my wife!
You, get out of my shop!
Well, what did he do?
Joey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
So, who's the mystery man?
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
Well, uh, he's a doctor.
A real doctor?
Ahh, miss? More coffee?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
I'm sorry.
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Um, yeah.
May I see it?
Oh my God! That was flirting?!
Oh, is there a problem?
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Yeah.
Wow!
I know a guy who's the 18th.
When's your birthday?
Feburary 16th.
Wow, that's close. When's yours?
October 25th.
Do you know who at my office?
Who is it?
It is your office.
John?
Oh John! Great!
He's getting married tomorrow right?
No. No, I haven't seen him.
Oh damn!
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
I wasn't invited.
I won! That was my quarter!
Hello!
I won! I won! I finally won!
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.
I just remembered, I have to do something.
Yeah. Oh.
What's wrong?
Oh. What?
Um, leave.
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Why, do you write him a lot?
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
That's it. That's my whole name.
Tag Jones.
Uh-huh, go on.
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
Oh, that's great, that is great!
Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Of course it's your friend Tanya.
Don't you want to know about the sex?
As much as he needs.
Chandler?
So, uh, how often can you do it?
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
Oh, that's great. Look at that.
It's uh...
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
Somebody called about a monkey?
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Hi, thanks for coming.
Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
Thanks.
That - that's an idea.
Uhh, not that I know of.
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
Oh?
Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
What's too much fun?
Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
Am I?!
Yes!
Or so I would have you believe.
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
I know! It's awful. I love you.
He's got a girlfriend!
I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
Have you seen Chandler?
No. Why?
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Great.
Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey. Morning, dear.
Good for you. Alrighty, next?
I know.
Hi, were the Rostins. Err, Im J.C., and hes Michael, and were having a boy, and a girl.

Im sorry, I didnt get... Susan is?
This is for the fourth grade.
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.
Err... we know what we want.
Much as you are.
Your turn.
Oh, thats good.
All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
How?
I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
No, it's fate!
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
The sex of the baby, Ross.
Don't you want to know about the sex?
The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Do you want to know?
Why don't we start right now!
It's a different building.
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Okay.
Here are the audition scenes.
No Santa? Was I bad?
When is Santa coming?
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Santa's mad at me.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
Comin' through. Move, move.
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Yeah?
Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
What happened?
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
Well, we got into a fight 'cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.
...Like, ...all of them?
Whaddyou mean?
Lose the other guys.
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
Well, thank you for giving it back.
Me.
Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Hello?!
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
It got caught on my watch.
Well it's gone.
What?! How's that?
Hey!
Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
Bye!
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
What do you need from the car?
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car.
Surprise me.
Okay.
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
Great! That's great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Okay.
No, I am.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I have a question about this scene.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
Yes?
Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
How, how is this my fault?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Please. This is so your fault.
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Really? That's great!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
Done.
Really?
Wow, you have really pretty feet.
Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?
Hi, I'm Maria.
These old things.
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Hi.
Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
Sooo!! Anyway...
Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Yeah, well.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?!
That'd be great, thanks.
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Melissa!
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
But you tell it really well, sweetie.
That's pretty much it.
Oops!
Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
Okay. I'll miss you.
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Hi!
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
How's it gonna be all right?!
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Uh-huh, I see that.
Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
Don't you want to know about the sex?
Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
Of course it's your friend Tanya.
The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
The sex of the baby, Ross.
Go! Come on! Roll!
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Roll-roll!!
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Okay, it's not a contest.
When is Santa coming?
Do you want me to check again?
Still no luck.
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
You know it?
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Where's your baby?
Ooh, steer clear of you.
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
That's right.
Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
They-they-they can smell fear.
Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
Yeah that works.
Hey!
Hey! How's Ben?
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Hello, Chip.
I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
So ah, Monica ready yet?
Now, which of you is the father?
Oh my God!
It's all right.
Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
Okay...
Ah, which ever is closest.
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
Regular or decaf?
Okay.
So ask me what I did today.
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
Wow, love your new nose!
Hi Rachel.
Oh hi!
Jack.
What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
But, you're not identical twins.
But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
That's right, $2,000.
Damnit Carl!
Oh my good God.
You have some life here, sweetie.
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
Okay lady, you're out of here.
Was it her quarter?
How about we talk about this over dinner?
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
I'm just taking you outside!
All right, you have yourself a deal.
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Okay. See?! I told ya!
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
Did anybody call for security?
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
Diverse.
You be cool.
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Why are you so jealous of me?
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
What?! What would make you think that?
Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
Do you want me to quit?
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
Well, somebody got some last night.
Ohh, God.
Good morning.
Twice.
Man, I sure miss Julie.
You're right. Of course you're right.
Of course I do.
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
So we're back on?
We're back on.
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
Well...
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
This couch belongs to us.
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
Yeah.
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
Become a drama critic!
Fabulous.
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
No, I ahh, had another idea.
Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.
Look, you wanna use our place?
We did it!!
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
Wow! You are really good at this.
With a K.
Oh-oh-hey!
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now.
Who drank all the Kamikazes?
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
Nobody! We put them in here!
You want some?!
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
What, wait, you mean like this?
What?
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
Your not doing it.
You mean like exclusive friends?
Well, you seem fine.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
You, get out of my shop!
Son of a bitch!
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
Well, what did he do?
He went out with my wife!
He can have his job back.
Okay.
What?
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
That's great. Thanks Rach.
Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
And could I get my ring back?
We're closing.
All right.
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
Doctors are wrong all the time.
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
Well, yeah.
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Sounds like a date to me.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
Instead of...?
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Hey!
Aren't you going to swallow that?
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
Wow.
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Yeah, isn't that great?
I don't care! You just get him!
And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
But-but, Liam's on my team.
I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
The Red Ross! Okay.
I want to talk to you about your review.
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
Oh my God.
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
Why? So you could hang up on me?
I'd love an ice water.
No, thank you.
You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.
You got it.
Joey, what are you doing?
No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
You're going to Minsk.
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
Your messages have been erased.
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Noooooooo!
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
She got a job in L.A.
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Where's Kate?
What?!
I've been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? Where have you been? Vic?!
That's my wife!!! Get out!
Joey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
Well, we should go.
Yeah.
Is that an expensive blouse?
Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice.
Dude!
If you want it to be.
Here's your girlfriend's button.
I came to talk to you about Howard.
Oh hi Phoebe.
Mr. President.
Howard?
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
Are you travelling with a child?
I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
I thought it went very well.
No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
There's nobody here!
Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
I missed you. I'm gonna get changed.
You always said I'd make it.
Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
OK.
Um, now. Phoebs.
So uh, do you live around here?
Kristen.
Got it! So...
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
I'll remember that.
Uhh, you said there was a party.
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
Mr. Treeger.
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!
Well have we finished the scene?
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
As were you.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
'Cause you guys were on a break.
But you're not anymore!
No, I'm not.
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
When's my daddy coming back?
So. I guess I'll see you around.
Oh, my pleasure.
You're welcome.
What, that's it?
"See you around?"
What's the matter? Are you upset?
Hey.
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Come on. I'll let you lead.
You wanna dance?
No, that's fine.
Ok.
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
I know, it's horrible isn't it?
Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
I was going to call him, but...
What?
Nothing. No, nothing.
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
I'd really rather talk to him.
You are playing American football?
No, no, no, no, no!
Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.
I'm Dutch.
Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Oh.
Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
That's weird, she locked the door.
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
Good luck!
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
With a K.
Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am...
That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
In the box.
Chandler?
Can I get some ice here?!
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Oh, just years of experience.
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
You can say that again Mac.
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
They all had a thing for him.
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
Aw, Mom...
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
I'll check the kitchen floors.
Yeah, I was just kidding.
Okay.
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
Yum-my!
You're doing great, you're doing fine.
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Not.... helping!
Hello! Oh, sorry.
What do you see? What do you see?
Well all right, one thing happened?
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Well I'm sorry.
Hey! How did everybody sleep?
Good morning.
Hey.
Oh, great.
Like a log.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
It's a good play, isn't it?
Oh, absolutely!
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
Okay, I...
Checking to see if it's even.
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
What-what 'cha doin'?
'Kay.
Looks good.
Now get on out of here, you!
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Scene 5, take 1.
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
And Action!
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
Drops. Here, they're free.
Drops!
What?
Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later.
What're you doing? Are you scratching?
Fine.
Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
You're scratching. Give me the dice.
Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
Any time you're ready, Joey.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Oh yes, there you are.
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
Okay!
Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
Yeah?
Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
Drake, what're you getting at?
How, how can you be here and there.
'Cause it's a television show.
I'm not Drake.
That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
So? Huh? What do you think?
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
Is she great or what?
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
And wait, I've got something for you.
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
Mark!!
It's okay, Rachel knows.
Thank you. I'm from New York.
Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
No way!
You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
Oh my God!
I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
I think you've got concussion.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
Ohh, fun!
Ohh, great!
Yeah.
Okay, see ya.
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
She passed away.
Ohh!
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
A part of him did yes.
Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.
What's wrong, sweetie?
Nothing, nothing.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Oh. They don't.
Well, I don't know. Are you a masseur?
Ohh great.
Can I, can I help you with something?
Yes I am.
Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
Hi!
So, are you ready to go?
Oh sure, right back there.
Hey, where are we going to lunch?
And I do have one seat left.
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
Ohh, good.
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.
Ow! Did you just bite me?
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Oh.
No!
What?
Do you two know each other?
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
No. No.
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Honey, honey, people are looking.
No, I-I-I gotta go.
No. No! No! No!
I don't care! I don't care!!
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
Well, we had a table in college.
But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
Man you are incredible.
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
Would you.......Would you hug me?
Hey Chandler?
Yeah?
I'm a little busy here Paul.
That's exactly what my dad used to say!
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
I'm sorry?
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
Give me a 'for instance'.
Okay.
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
Marlon-
Oh that's great! You are the best!
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
I thought you didn't smoke.
Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night.
Really! You-you sail?
No-no, but I support it.
Okay.
Take care.
Oh look at you! So handsome!
Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
Our little boy is getting married.
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Are you Chandler?
...the scotch and the cigarettes...
...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
I've got no reason to stay.
Okay, I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
You dog!
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Yeah but I didn't read anything.
I think we've seen enough!
No, I really did forget my purse.
I forgot my purse.
Oh.
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
Horrible!
I've had a really good time tonight.
That wouldn't help me.
Ohh, yes it would.
Mmm.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
No, I was working on my pottery.
Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
Obviously.
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Yeah! Yep.
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
I don't want you taking that thing.
Who-ah-ho.
We'll go to a hotel.
Okay. You ready to push again?
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
So gross!
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
All right, you two, stop it!
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
That's why you broke up with me?
It's pretty clear.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
We're gonna give it another try.
...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
Oh just say it Kyle!
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
I'm gonna work on that.
Well that's not a third nipple.
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
No?
First of all, it's on your ass.
I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
It doesn't say that in the script.
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
It does in mine!
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
Ahh, look at you, you look great.
Hey.
Hi.
Do I? Thank you, so do you.
Thanks.
N-No running in the chapel!
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!
Hey!
'We' would be me and Rick.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
Who's Rick?
Who's Rick?
Oh my God! What are you doing here?
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
Emily!
I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
You are so sweet.
We kinda broke up this morning.
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
Who's Barney.
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
Oh my God, is it really that bad?
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Are you going to eat that bread?
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.
Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
You make me laugh.
So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?
Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya.
Um, yeah, I'm just... ..working.
Oh!
Um you, you got a minute?
So.
Uh-huh.
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Got it!
Let's roll!
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
That saves us a conversation.
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
Me too, we should get goin'.
No, let me explain! Fired!!
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
What?
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
Ross of.....
Of Ross and Rachel.
Oh hey, hey Mark.
Hey, hold on a second.
What? Do you think he likes me?
Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
So, um, are you gonna call him?
No, Joey.
Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken?
Morning's here! The morning's here!
Yeah.
Monica and Rachel made out.
Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here!
Hey! You're back!
Scene 5, take 2.
Okay.
All right, from the top.
Take 36 is up!
All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?
Hey Pheebs! How's it going?!
Take it easy.
Dumbass!
Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack.
Wow! Well, welcome back!
Phoebe's got another job, right?
Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
Great set tonight Phoebs.
I know.
It's uh, it's already been roasted.
And for you sir?
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Are you close with them?
Stop saying that. I hate that.
I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
Okay. Okay.
Uh, Ross?
Are you still mad at us?
No, it's too soon for you guys.
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Yeah, you're right about that.
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
And he's a great brother!
I had a sister.
You guys live around here too?
Oh, there's our stop.
Get outta here. This is our stop too.
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
You know it?
How long do you want the cuffs?
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
I know!
At least as long as I have the pants.
I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
"You have two new messages."
Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
That's where you pick up the bag.
Oh my God!!
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
Exactly.
No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
So ah, what's wrong with him?
Me too.
Bye, Chandler.
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
Alright, well, be good, I love you.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
No help required Chico.
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
What?
Five oh dollars.
Well, whatever works for ya...
Are you okay? What's wrong?
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
That was an accident! And so were you.
Oh, my baby!
Cut!
Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
What?
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
No, just a salad will be fine.
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
You got it.
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
A joke they would appreciate?
No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
I'm thinkin' no.
What did you say?!
Have a seat son. Hey!!
Guys?
Over here.
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
I know.
May I see your boarding pass?
Hi!
Hi.
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
You guys tell them you were married?
They're nice guys.
Oh, they're firemen guys.
No way!
Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
Shh! No! Joe Hill!
Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
You're Frank Buffay?
You just said...
Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
Okay, what was wrong with that call?
We don't need any toner.
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
Hi.
We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
Oh yes! Thank you!
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
Do you know where the store is?
I'll just run to the store and get some.
Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.
No.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
...the scotch and the cigarettes...
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Here you go.
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
Your a poet and don't know it.
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
Yes. They're insanely white.
Are those your teeth??
Ohh, you can see them, huh?
I-I, did that for you.
What's a matter with you?
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Chandler!
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Hey Duck, is Chick here?
Sweety...
I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
So you ah, ready for our last practice?
I feel good! ...Who are you?
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
You look good!
Oh, sorry.
I'm Phoebe Buffay.
Oh my god! Youre amazing!
I am?
Sure, why not?
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
I think I lost. Three times.
No I didn't.
I think you did.
Uh...Cookie?
Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Huh.
Uhh....
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
Can I ask what-Come on in.
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
Okay.
Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
Would you like my tin-foil hat?
No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
Oh, that's fine, no.
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
Please, let me do something.
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
C'mon!
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Yeah!
Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
What was that?
Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
That was so lame.
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Good. I should really start wearing hats!
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Hope you had a nice flight.
We appear to have angered it.
Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
What?! What?!
We?! We angered it?!
Oh, I think I see the problem. And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love.
Of course! It's her favorite.
No! I did!
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
More of Grandma's teramisu.
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
It's gonna be so great.
Hi! What's going on?
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
Come on, lady!
I'm sorry things didn't work out...
Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
Okay, bye.
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
Well uh, do either of you smoke?
Yes, they can stay with us.
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
It got caught on my watch.
Hey!
Ooh, nice.
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You had sex with her didn't you?
Bye.
So, we gettin' a fish?
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Alright, let me just get my coat.
What about my friend Victor?
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
Is it true they have beer?
Keep singing! Keep singing!
Does it always, uh--?
No, no that was the first.
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
I felt it!
Well kinda old, like 30.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Oh.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
Maybe because you've got the keys?
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
Porsche.
This is totally your fault!
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
No!
Eh, worth a shot. Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
Yeah.
These got left for ya.
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Oh.
Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
Do not give him any money!
I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
Oo-oo!
Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
Yeah, leave!
Yeah, get out! Now!
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
That's sweet. Could I take her?
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
With this ring? No contest.
What's wrong, sweetie?
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
You are!
You are!
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
They loved me!
Oh my God!
There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
So. How'd you guys meet?
Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Eew! It's creepy looking!
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
No, I hate cats.
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
No, these are my pants.
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
Yeah, move over just a little bit.
I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
Yeah, could you scooch?
Keep on scooching.
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
So? I mean have you thought about it?
Oh, well no problem there.
Easy Lenny.
Okay. Here's the thing.
Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What's the thing?
The one in the director's chair.
Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
You need to get out of my chambers.
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Yeah!
Why are your eyes so white?
How's my Bing-a-ling?
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Oh my God!!
When's my daddy coming back?
'Cause you guys were on a break.
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Sharing is good.
Really? Then why are you like that?
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
You by the door. In or out?
In.
I'd better get back to my desk.
Yes, at 4:00.
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
My what?
Ah here, we brought wine.
Hi, Geoffrey.
Hi.
Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
Oh, that's great. Look at that.
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
Yep!
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Your tax dollars?
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi!
Argh!
Argh!
Hi!
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
Okay.
No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
Well you should be embarrassed.
I did, but that was really fun.
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
A part of him did yes.
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Yes, we were just...
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Hey!
Thank you so much for coming.
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Hello Ross. I love what you've done with this space.
Hey, where are we going to lunch?
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
Oh sure, right back there.
I was thinking Chinese food.
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.
Are we in London?
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
What?
Nothing. No, nothing.
Wow! What an unusual cat!
No, I hate cats.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
1 minute 50 seconds.
Fine! Two minutes. Go.
This is-you-
Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
I'm Irish.
And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!.
Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
No one likes a buttmunch.
Hi.
Six dollars, please.
You're not wearing the patch yet.
She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
I know.
He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
Um, yeah, um, twin thing.
Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
How'd you know I was coming?
I can't believe you did this.
I can't believe you... ..did this.
All right. Here's your first baby.
All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
Yes!
I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
Okay, now I've really have to go!
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
I gotta tell you, you look great now.
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
I was probably waiting for it to open.
You look great too.
You're an excellent patient!
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
Honey, honey, people are looking.
I don't care! I don't care!!
You can't leave! I have your shoe!
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
I've literally never been this happy.
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
Oh God.
Wasn't there a little song?
Oh please God, let there be a song.
Is Tony Randall dead?
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
No.
I don't think so.
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
Happy birthday dad.
Oh thank you.
So, have you kids eaten yet?
Yes!
There you go.
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Would ya care to venture one?
Would you care to venture one?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
All right, let's move on.
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
Pete.
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
No! Why does he have to go?
Then it's okay!
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
So it's-it's not heeled yet?
Why is this happening to me?! I don't know, maybe it's my wound.
Forget it.
No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
Oh no-no-no...
You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.
I can promise not to tell her again.
But, we are.
Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
Jasmine?
Uh-huh.
Just give me a chance too...
Why? So you could hang up on me?
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
No! Phoebe!
No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
Oh, I get a puppy!!
Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Ohh. . .K. How come?
What?
Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
That dies with me.
So will I.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
Just do it.
Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
Someone I can spoil, y'know?
Sp-spoil?
Uh-huh.
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
But, you left the chair area.
But, you got up!
But, I never left the room!
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
WHOAA!!
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Any minute now.
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
Periodontist.
Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
What'd you think I was, a hooker?
Ewww!!!
You can't have sex with her!
No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
So you like the short hair better.
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Hi!
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Hi.
And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
What's the matter with him?
Ahh that's the 2 points.
And where is your hat?
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
Oh, I don't know about that.
Really! You got a place upstate?
Wow!
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Sure!
Well, I'll see you later.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
Yeah.
Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
A sandwich?
Good luck! Go get 'em!
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
We could write it down for you?
Coffee.
Okay.
No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary
Wellll?
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Show time!
Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
Oh really, you guys tryin' again?
Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating.
Yeah.
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
No, that's not exactly what I was..
He's... new.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
So what do you want?
Weird Girl, what are you doing?
What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
I know.
No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
I feel great. In fact! What?
Y'know what?
What?
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
Oh, I'm sorry.
But, he told me over the phone.
I-I-I don't think so.
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
He told me in person.
That's weird.
And who may I say is calling?
Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
Hi, is Rachel there?
This is Ross?
Ross of.....
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
I, I don't know.
Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Okay. Oh no, I have to.
Too bad, she's leaving.
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
It's not Rick.
You're saying, my wife is in you?
Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
When I was six years old.
Okay.
All right.
Hm-mmm.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
This is really hard for me to say.
Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
Sure.
Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
Oh, no, no, it's about you.
So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Well, we both have.
Well, actually it's just from me.
I got you the foot massager.
Hey, how, how did you do that?
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
What?
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
Aren't you with that girl over there?
Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
I'm sorry.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
Well, not just for you.
Well, what do you mean?
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
Why not?!
Well, that's because of a lot of...
I know!
Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
No come on. Come on tell me.
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
No. See you don't understand.
Come on.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Nothing at all?
No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
Uh-huh!
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
Great. I'll ah, see ya then.
Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
We'll be there.
All right, rock on.

I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Wow! You made a profit!
Oh yeah, there you go.
Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
She's not much of a phone person.
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
I've found....
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
We will.
Then, you're redoing it because...
Are you remaking the bed?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
I don't see why not.
Here's my retainer!
So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
Yeah.
Very nice. Very nice.
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
I think you may have a drinking problem.
Oh, no, no, it's about you.
What about me?
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
That's not what she said last night.
No no no. Talk... dirty.
Talk to me.
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Wha... what, here?
Yes...
Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
Okay.
Hi Whitney.
Yep. Okay.
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
Ross? That opens my cervix.
Thanks.
Quack, quack..
Barry?
C'mon in.
Well there's one and there's another .
It's the Gellers!
Where?
Lovely to meet you.
Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
I like her. She sees smart.
Oh my God!
I know, I can do more than cook.
Uhh, Rachel, my parents...
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Can I get you something from the bar?
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
I hear you can get people out of here.
Well those are very popular frames.
Neil Sedaka wears them.
Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
Yeah, like a chimney.
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
Oh. Thanks.
You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
I'm gonna try.
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
You got a callback too didn't you?
Yeah I did!
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
I don't know. Let me see the ring.
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
Okay, that's enough honey!
Great! Okay, here.
All right.
Okay, she was here, but she left.
She's not here and please come in.
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Well where did she go?
Well she said she had to think things over.
Come on along and listen to...
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
Okay, Widow!
...the lullabye of...
Hey, what kind of work do you do?
Whoa! Big octopus.
Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um.
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Oh, okay. Here you go.
Hey, where's the chicken?
I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
Who's your roommate?
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Ow!
Oh!!
I don't know, they're just a little blah!
I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Blah?!
Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
So? Huh? What do you think?
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
Yeah!!
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...
She's not here and please come in.
Chandler.
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Okay, she was here, but she left.
You don't secretly smoke do you?
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
No!
So it's just your mother then.
You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
What the hell is this?
Ew, this feels very weird.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand.
So I understand you're looking for a place.
Yes.
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
No-no, I'm staying put.
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
Yeah.
Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
I'll just run to the store and get some.
So how did you know I was even here?
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Ok. That's fine.
Your mom called me. So is this her?
No, this is a loaner.
Really? Because I think about you all the time.
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
Really?
I mean, there's a statue in Minsk...
Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Heard what?
Joanna passed away last night.
Night Mon. Night Julio.
Well, if you don't, I will.
Would you please go?
Adios.
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Nobody! We put them in here!
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
Who drank all the Kamikazes?
You want some?!
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
What happened son?
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
So how do you kids like your coffee?
Yeah.
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Just a little bit of sugar.
I think it makes you look really dangerous.
He does that?!
Uh, I don't know, whatever.
Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
I love both of you!
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
We kinda broke up this morning.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Ohio!! Thank you!
Huh! Where is the dog?!
I'm probably gonna need those. Huh?
Yeah?
You ah, you forgot your shoes.
Hey, listen you ah....
Hmm?
Oh shout, that would have been fun.
Great. That would be fine.
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
Hey.
Glad to be of help. Matches.
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
Ok, that's Eric.
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
I don't know.
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
How can they do this to me?
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
Better. Yeah.
Yeah?
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
You are now.
My God, what were you thinking about?
You missed the exit!
Oh, sorry.
Um, Barry.
Awwww!!
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
No, I'm alright man. Really.
No, I'm picking you up.
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
You used to be my babysitter.
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
Ooh!
Oh, ok bye-bye.
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
Bite me, blondie!
Is this about me taking your watch?
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
Chloe? Hi..
You took my watch?
I'm sorry, I do that.
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
Well.
No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
Oh yeah.
No.
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Alright, well, be good, I love you.
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Really stupid.
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Hello?
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
Tag Jones.
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
Yes?
Oh my God, Jill!
Oh my God, Rachel!
Do you not want to be seen with me?
What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Uh no, they're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
Maybe. Does that scare ya?
Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Both of us?
Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
We'll be there.
Nope! That never happened to me!
Normal.
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Nope.
I remember when we first got engaged.
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
Yeah! As long as we're here!
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
You guys wanna eat here?
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
No you answer it and take pledges.
This will be your phone.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
But I'm the host!
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
Am I allowed to drink anything?
59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
I'll get it.
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
What kind of surgery?!
Transplant.
Hair transplant.
But you're not bald.
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
Guess what, I got an audition!
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey-hey.
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
You found that handle, did ya?
Fine!
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
That's not funny.
Well that's not true.
So uh, here's your office set!
Thanks!
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
Ohhh, OK.
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
Oh God, yes!
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
Is it true they have beer?
Alright, let me just get my coat.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
Everything you've heard is true.
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
I think it was valued at 19,000
Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
Joey! Joey, good one!
How did you know there was a but?
And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.
But.
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
Yes.
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
How, how can you be here and there.
Somebody wanna help me out here?
Oh, I know, I know.
'Cause it's a television show.
Drake, what're you getting at?
Hey, mind if I use the phone?
Tonight. What are you doing?
I'm coming up!
Oh, I...
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Oh.
Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Colorado.
Why don't we take it for a spin?
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
All right!
Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
Well, you kids take the train in?
Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
So I understand you're looking for a place.
No-no, I'm staying put.
Why, where are you going?
I don't know.
I thought it was... quite tasty.
Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
And you?
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
A bitch?
Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
Oh no!
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
Great! That's great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.
I know.
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
No.
Well, here it is.
Fine! Two minutes. Go.
Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind. You got one minute.
Daddy!
This is-you-
1 minute 50 seconds.
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
No, it's too soon for you guys.
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
Hi.
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
Well...
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
What?!
Okay, a thousand.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
No, she'll yell at me again.
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
Alright, I can get you out.
What?
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
So am I!
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
All right.
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Well, that makes me feel so good.
Bumpy?
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
I do not always have to be-okay, okay.
Jurassic Park could happen.
Pretty nice?
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
No, she touched mine first!
She broke my arm.
He touched my fanny.
That's my job!
So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you?
Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Hi!
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Whoa, snowing out there?
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
Why on earth would I understand this?
Oh.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Comin' through. Move, move.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Ok, you weren't there.
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
You go get that animal outta here.
I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
What's goin' on?
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
Who is it?
It's Phoebe.
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Umm, yeah-no thanks.
I think it's great you guys are doing this.
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Well, we are great guys.
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
Okay, I can let it go at eight.
Are you interested in this ring?!
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
We stand firm at $10.
How would you like to pay?
Ross, they are killing you out there!
Oh, poor baby.
Tell my son that I love him. Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
That's not true!
She's right! You have to stop!
God, your hair sure is different!
Hey!
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
So uh, where's Monica?
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Yeah.
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
Five dollars a box.
So, thank you for the delicious dinner.
Okay.
I knew you'd understand.
You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Hey what are you guys looking at?
What?! I've never seen one before!
So are you his mother or his father?
Jack!
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Doubtful.
I am famished. What do I want...
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Waaay too special.
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
So, what did Francis leave me?
Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Okay.
Huh?
Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
Did I, uh, did I miss something?
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Okay.
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Ok, this could go on for a while.
Hi.
Hi.
We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Wait! We need shoes!
Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.
Cannot feel my tounge.
Bullies, big bullies.
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
Yes, and that's why we're here.
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
Ross, whose glasses are those?
What? I don't see anything.
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
Mine.
You wear bi-focals?
That was great, the kids loved you.
Not at all inappropriate!
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Yay, I rock.
And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.
Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
Well, it felt French.
Oh God, I really had a good time!
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Yeah!
I'll even let you ring the bell.
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
So, um, will you bring the truck?
Oh, my god.
See, there you go, the cleansing works!
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
Well it's very unsettling.
....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
717? Where's 717? Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?
No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
So what are you guys out doing today?
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
You done?
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Right?
John Glenn is here?!
No, Joey!
You're into hardcore S&M right?
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
Yeah! That would be great!
Well, I-I guess-I...
Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
We stopped at the gift shop.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
Where the hell have you been?
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
What do you see? What do you see?
You're doing great, you're doing fine.
Hello! Oh, sorry.
We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
Oh, look at that.
I see. Have you considered therapy?
Oh, that's better then.
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
I think just the annulment for today.
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
Yeah! Yeah, we can!
That's too bad.
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
I guess.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
What do we got there?
It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.
Hello.
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
So is Joey around?
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
Oh! Okay! Phew!
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
...Quality, right, great.
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Our little boy is getting married.
Dude.
Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
Oh look at you! So handsome!
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
Happy birthday!
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
I know, it is.
Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Oh he knows! For the most part.
We kinda need to talk.
Both of you together?
Well, call me if you change your mind.
Which one?
...The second guy.
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
There's one leaving in thirty minutes.
Hello.
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
Ohh, good.
And I do have one seat left.
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
Well I tell you what...
Yeah?
I won't speed.
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away?
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Hi, nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you Monica. Bing!
Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
It did at first, but not anymore.
Sure.
Uh, does it hurt?
Chandler?
So, uh, how often can you do it?
Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31.
Oh, it's you.
Yeah. What?!
Nu-uh!
Yea-huh! That's what is says on my birth certificate.
No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
I'll get it.
I got itI'm getting it!
Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking...
My drinking?
Said what? Exactly.
That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.
What did Joey say? I like you back?
What?
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
No you didn't!
Well, then who's been dead for five years?
Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
No, sir.
Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight.
What was that?
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Ohh-ha-ha!
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
Oh cool! You made him cry!
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to...
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
Umm, well, what else could it be?
You're scratching. Give me the dice.
What're you doing? Are you scratching?
No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
No.
Give me the dice.
You-you have a very beautiful... eye.
Here, let me help.
Thank you.
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
Here, I'll get it.
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
That's great.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
That's it?
Yeah, it was really hard.
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Do I know you?
Joey!
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Nothing?
Y'know what? We need to move on.
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
COME ON!!!!
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
You don't play the oboe!
I could play the oboe!
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
Oh, that's great.
Why are- why are you so tanned?
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
My breast milk is gross?
Why'd you freak out?
Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
This should be fun.
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
I'm just going to need to see your passport.
Well you can split it with another credit card.
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty.

I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.
My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
But....
Okay.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Even if he were... cornered?
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Well I, I don't know. Why?
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Why? Are we done for the day?
As were you.
So I got your car, it's right outside.
That's what you told me.
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
Why don't we do a trial run.
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
I'm the supply manager.
Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
That's great.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
No, it was. It was very very good.
Well, what about Mindy?
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
No, but it did! Didn't it?!
Oh my God! It didn't remind you of...
Don't say it!
Yeah!
Oh man!!
No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
Y'know what?
I can't do this.
Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
Ok, thanks.
Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
This is from the woman at the bar.
Yeah?!
Oh!
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.
You were fired? What're you gonna do?
Why?
Because they made me.
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
In the bank.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
Ok will do. So glad you came.
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
Oh ok.
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
Okay, I...
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
Alright.
Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Uh.
No way!
Oh.
But we broke up.
No no no! Federal regulations!
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
Alright. What's the message?
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
What's this.
Could you get us a couple of beers?
Really.
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
Keep on scooching.
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
What's the matter?
I have a feelin'... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.
Jack used to handle the finances!
Dear?
Just the matter of ...payment?
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Sure...
You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
You really didn't know?
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
Sure I would!
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
No, I just think Monica was that fat.
So you guys want me to take this back?
No, pretty much just a towel.
Oh God.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Bye Joey. Last night was fun.
I know!
Okay!
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
Oh and I'll call ya too!
Ah well, this is the living room.
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Impressive.
All right. This is the kitchen.
I mean, there's a statue in Minsk...
Really? Because I think about you all the time.
Really?
Uh-huh.
That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles...
Y-, y-, you like that show?
No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
You don't like that show?
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
One more chance Ursula, please?
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
What?
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
Wh..
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Don't, I like it dirty.
That's your call.
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Are they, uh, firm?
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
So really, what'd ya have?
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
No, let's just leave the lights on.
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Oh my God!
I had a problem.
Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
Shut up, I'm happy.
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
Ok.
Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
17 years ago.
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Hey. What are we drinkin' over here.
Hi Joey's sisters!
Hey!
Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
They prefer it if I don't barter.
Sorry.
How about 600 and these earrings?
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
Well you can split it with another credit card.
I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
Hi.
I don't know why I'm here.
I don't know.
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
Hi.
Ok, this could go on for a while.
Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
Tuesday.
Why aren't you at home in bed?
Chicken or small?
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
This is impossible. Its just impossible.
Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.
Susan, go deep.
What is, honey?
What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in.
Joanna passed away last night.
Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
Heard what?
Oh my God! How?!
Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
What are you guys doing?
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
Well, so do a lot of people.
Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
That's just halftime, there's more of this.
I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so...
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Right.
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
Well, thank you for giving it back.
Hello?!
Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
You lost 13 million dollars.
Phoebe, listen...
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
Are you all right?
Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
Oh, no-
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
How are we gonna get out of that one?
Tomorrow!
Can't wait!
What?
I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
Oh, no, no.
Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
Still no smile?
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
Your mom called me. So is this her?
No, this is a loaner.
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Okay. I'll be right back.
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
Good for a scrud.
That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
Who's next?
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch.
And to you too, Helen.
Oh, okay. Send her in.
Hi.
Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
It seemed like such a simple idea.
All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
I'm a party planner. I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
Wow! What do you do now?
Okay!
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
What can I say? She nailed it.
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
She's a woman!
Okay, is there anything else?
Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube.
Judy, the kids..
Ohh, I thought that you....
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
I am so attracted to him right now.
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
I didn't realize that she was so close.
I know!
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Will you be my maid of honour?
Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Okay.
Of course!
Oh that's so great!
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Sure.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
And for the gentleman?
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
And what will that be on the side of?
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
What do you, what do you think?
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
I'll see you after work sweetie.
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
Ohhhh man
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
Why don't you try to do-
Right, why do you keep saying that?
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay.
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
Yeah. Gotcha.
Ok. That's fine.
So how did you know I was even here?
Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Get out.
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Nothing.
Bing! You got those numbers for me?
Fight's over!
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
No, I ah, I didn't do them.
Oh, you forgot?
Some guys are just lucky I guess.
Oh Drake.
Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.
Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?
Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Okay!
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Thank you!
It is okay, if I stay and watch?
I heard that!
Well, I said it loud.
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Well, that went well.
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
Oh well, I'm divorced.
Ohhh, wow.
And there it is.
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
You don't need to fill these silences.
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
Oh, okay, thanks.
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
Oh, I spilled some.
I got it.
What?
Sorry. You look beautiful.
Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?
Pretty uhm, different huh?
Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.
Eddie.
Morning.
Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
Jack, would you let it go?
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
Are you wearing my glasses?
Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
You bet. Maybe some other time?
Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
Ready, Annabelle?
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Hi Steve!
This is Rachel.
Yeah, OK.
Oh my God, who died on this?!
I'm the ring bearer.
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
Absolutely. Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to...
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Hi.. how was the game?
Well..
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Alan.
Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know?
Well y'know, he's got access.
Yeah.
Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
That's the one.
Yeah, I filled them out last night?
What?
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Hey Rachel!
It could've been a hair straightener.
Well someone does.
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Oh.
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
So what. I say, punch him.
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
I'll do it.
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
Doctors are wrong all the time.
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
You're so sweet!
Ohh, you're so sweet!
Huh.
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Fellas, these guys were here first.
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
Sorry.
I should just be happy to be near you.
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
But that's what...
Hey I-
Hey what?
So what. I say, punch him.
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
Right, like the kind you...
How'd you know I was coming?
Um, yeah, um, twin thing.
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
All right. Here's your first baby.
Yes!
Frank Jr. Jr.!!
You by the door. In or out?
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Really? Then why are you like that?
In.
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
I'm just serving it.
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
Ahh, miss? More coffee?
I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real!
I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
Okay, good-good for you.
Wow, Rhonda.
I'm Scott.
Pecan sandy, just made em.
No, that means nothin to me.
Uhhhaahh.
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Uh, sure, why not.
Youre kidding? She seems so...
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
Thats unbelievable.
Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Hey!
Hi!
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Where's Kate?
She got a job in L.A.
Why? So you could hang up on me?
I want to talk to you about your review.
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Just give me a chance too...
What?! They wanted a scary story!
What a sweet story.
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
The dark of night has disappeared!!
Hey! Get into gear!
Breakfast is near!
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
Okay!
No, I have some turning 21 to do.
Uhh, I can't.
Oh, you have some studying to do?
Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to...
What are you doing?
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
And now you'll see me buying it.
No!
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
Look, you don't want to fight me.
Okay, all right. Let's do it. And...Action!
Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
Yeah, sure.
We have to find the rest of the platoon!
Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone!
First of all, it's on your ass.
Well that's not a third nipple.
No?
Well then, what is it?!
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
I thought there wasn't a ball?
No! It don't go up on the wall!
I did.
All right, let's get me back up there!
What-But you saw the show!
Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
No. A break from us.
And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
Oh, hi Chloe.
I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
We?
No-no really, was-was that not okay?
What?
Nothing. Nothing.
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
Oh my God! It didn't remind you of...
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
I mean he just started going out with her.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Hi!
Richard!
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
It's an expression.
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
So, did I hear Poconos?
You do now. You're having dinner with me.
Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
Shut up.
I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
Did you cut this couch in half?
You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
That's what I'm telling you.
This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
I was just being polite, but, alright.
It's a lovely apartment.
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
What's up?
In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
Your grandmother would have hated this.
Beautiful!
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
So, are we gonna get together or what?
I know.
I'm back.
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Great, I'll see you then.
Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later.
Drops. Here, they're free.
Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
Thanks again.
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
I'm sorry?
Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
That's just great.
Um, cheers.
Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.
I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
Alright.
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Yeah.
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
Oh.
Ow! Did you just bite me?
I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
A surfer.
Oh yeah surfer?
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
Saw Regis Philbin once...
I wasn't ready for it.
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
You owe me a waffle.
Still rolling, annnnd action!
Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Thank you. Thank you.
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!
Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Uhh....
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Oh, hi, darling!
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
France sucks!
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
You okay there, slugger?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
Hi.
Hi.
Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?
But...
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
They're your backup singers... beind you.
Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.
This is from the woman at the bar.
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
What time is it?
One.
Sooo, you've been doing this long?
That is one good looking man!
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice.
I am gonna try and quit drinking.
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
Ooohh, why?
Hey.
God! What are you, in second grade?
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
Let it be me! Let it be me!
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
You ready to go to the batting cage?
Hey.
Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
Oh! Wow! Hey!
Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
Saw your head. Saw your head.
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
What is it?
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Yeah.
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
So am I!
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
As much as he needs.
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Yeah, I forget which ones.
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Um-hum, you're jealous.
Of... of what?
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
Hey, you listen.
So, are you a member of any gym.
I wanna quit the gym.
It's okay man, be strong.
No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?
All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
I see the head.
Yes, it has a head!
I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
All right. Here's your first baby.
Which one? Which button, Jack.
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
Press the button.
The button, the button.
I can't believe you did that.
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
Really?!
Yeah!
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
What makes you think that I might not be okay?
I saw Richard.
Would ya care to venture one?
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
Would you care to venture one?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye.
Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.
That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Ben! Ben! Ben!
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Thank you!
No, I mean it's not Geller.
All right, honey, time to start pushing.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
But they're not here yet!
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
Okay.
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Back on in 30 seconds people!
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Come on man! You've been here all day!
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
Y'know what, I should do it.
Yeah!
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
All right.
Would you like to move over to the couch?
You make me laugh.
Hmm-Hmm.
Mmm-Hmm.
Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little.
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?
Oh... shoot.
OK.
Take care.
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
Well, I'm not gonna talk because...
Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
Yes.
One, two, three...
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
All right.
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
No but he didn't really talk about anything.
Heavy.
Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
Oh.
Except stilts.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Don't do that.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Oh damnit!
Oh damnit!
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Ah whatever!
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
We're still on this side of the door.
Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom?
The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
Um-hmm.
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that?
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
Hey, where's his thing?
Chandler's a girl!
Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
We were playing rugby.
In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
What's ah, what's so funny about that?
Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
And look where they're sitting.
You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
Yeah.
This couch belongs to us.
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
What?!
Nevermind.
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
You're so sweet!
Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
Ross!
I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Me too!
Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Oh-ohh, thank you.
Well...
Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts us.
I Ross...
Take thee, Emily...
Yeah, y'know the license plate game?
No!
Do you like car games?
I love the license plate game!
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Well...
Yeah.
Yeah, she's gay.
Hey.
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
I wish I could talk to her.
What are you in love with her or something?
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
Ya know, she's having another baby.
Yep.
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
I thought she just had one.
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
All right, thank you so much for all your help.
Sure.
Yeah-eah-ha!
Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
You mean they're lovers.
If you wanna put a label on it.
Nope, nope, that's it.
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
Need uh, need a little hand there.
So, this was uh, really fun.
Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
You really don't seem like you do. That's...
Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Who-who else is in vice up there?
No, it was. It was very very good.
What's the matter?
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
Well, what about Mindy?
Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
You're a big scrud.
What's a scrud?
I don't have too. I can just look at you.
All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice.
Suddenly, I very aware that I'm naked.
Yeah, really.

Okay, quit down.
Mr. Simon's been waiting for- Oh my God!
Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
Well ah, ........y'know.
Both of us?
Maybe. Does that scare ya?
My God, you're choking! That better?
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Are you alright?
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Perfection?
He better go on for what I'm paying.
Uhh...Shall I go on?
Yes, yes, do go on.
After what he just said, you're paying for the whole bloody lot.
I think we'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross...
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Show me in the table.
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
Movies?
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
G'night.
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
Two.
Uh, the usher told us to come...
Oh, well I thought that ah...
Oh, you thought, huh? Yeah, well that didn't really work out too well for you did it you idiot!! What are you?! A moron!! Huh?! It says D-13! Okay?! Look you're surrounded by even numbers!! Did that give you some clue?!
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! Here! Hey man, you want the aisle?
No, I'm good.
You really don't seem like you do. That's...
Need uh, need a little hand there.
Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Well, what was supposed to happen?
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to...
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early...
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Oh cool! You made him cry!
Shut the door! Shut the door!!
Good luck.
Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars.
What's-what's going on?
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Okay.
So I guess it's Joey then!
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
Well, I, umm...
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
Sure, I-I-I...
No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
Hey guys!
No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Yeah!
Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there.
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Do you all promise?
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
Right! Okay.
Do you have my birth certificate?
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
Yeah.
I am not going to apologize to a tree!
Who are you talking too?
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
Oh, you're welcome.
Did you just smell my hair?
Oh God.
What?
You probably want us to move in together?
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
It doesn't scare me!
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Looks like that might come any minute.
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
Do I?
'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
Right. Could you sign this?
Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
Thanks.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........
'Kay!
Oh my God!
Things change, roll with em.
You're welcome.
But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
What do you mean?
Like this.
Uh-huh.
Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
Were you this cute in high school?
Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
Oh stop.
No you stop!
Uh, Phoebe you-you don't have an office.
I told that guy who answered your phone.
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
Phoebe, listen...
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
Am I allowed to drink anything?
Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Kiss her! Kiss her!
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Nope, not this time.
We really do feel bad about this though.
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
What about when I started dating Chandler?
I assume we're talking about the baby now.
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
You wanna smell him?
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
Great!
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
Back on in 30 seconds people!
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Aw, dammit!
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
Oh no-no-no...
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.
It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
You obviously can't keep away from her.
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Oh, alright.
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
Yes. Uh, can't you wait until tomorrow? All right. Unbelievable!!
Thanks.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Howard's the handy man!
Yes but too me he's just, man.
Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
So... they sss-still seem normal.
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
So?
That's because they are.
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Look I just thought that...
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
Mmm hmmm.
Want us to go?
Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime.
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Okay.
Basketball!
I'm sorry.
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
No kidding.
Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
No listen to me! She is crazy!
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Good morning.
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
You're doing it again.
We're not doing anything.
You don't have birds.
I could have birds.
Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
Are you over me?
That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
I'll be right down.
Wait, so, you're going?
No suds, no save. Ok?
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
What?
What's goin' on?
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Something like that?
Yeah.
Hey.
...and live forever as a machine!
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
Yeah, I gotta go.
That was an accident! And so were you.
Oh yes there is!
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
Oh, my baby!
And who is this little cutie pie?
Hello.
Hello.
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
You wanna smell him?
Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!
What?
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
I can't believe this!
Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
You're welcome.
You have no idea who I am, do you.
The Luisa from home room!
Yes!!
No, none at all.
None.
I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
All right then, it's settled.
Okay.
I'd love to!
What?
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Sure. Yep.
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
Here, I'll get it.
So the light went out in my refrigerator...
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
Weird Girl, what are you doing?
No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
Oh, that's fine, no.
Would you like my tin-foil hat?
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
What?!
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
Hmm.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
Whoa!!
I'm gonna get coffee.
We don't, really.
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so...
Hi!
Hi!
Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
My parents are going to be really mad.
We've only known each other for six weeks!
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
Is that-are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Yes.
Really, y'think so? I don't..
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Tell her what?
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
Oh! You're awake!
Look at you! How, how do you feel?
You look good!
I feel good! ...Who are you?
Think she got fired at Riffs?
Whats she doing here?
This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.
No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... ..bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?
Im gonna wait till after we order. Its her, right.
As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
Oh that is so great! That's...
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
Yes!
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
Yeah, that's her.
Thank you.
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Okay.
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
I think you've got concussion.
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Joey there's a girl on the phone for you.
Why?!
Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
Ohh great!! Hello.
Joey, it's Phoebe. Did you stop Rachel?
I was her accountant four years ago.
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
Ohhhh!
I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?
No. no.
Whad'ya mean no?
I almost forget the tickets, didn't I?
Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
Yeah, great, you betcha!
What?
For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.
It's a money thing, we don't have any.
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Wh-what?! Why?!
You're kidding right?
No.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
No we won't.
If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Wow. He's strict.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
Wow. He's strict.
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it.
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Well...
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
You picked a great couch.
Yeah?
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
No that's not true. That is not true.
Come on.
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
I missed this.
Me too.
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
That's the whole part?
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Eew! It's creepy looking!
That you and daddy were not on a break.
No more pranks.
And-and what else?
Very good.
Rachel! What are you doing here?
Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Yeah.
Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make...
You-you have to meet me in the middle here.
Oh, yeah.
There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
Dad!!
Almost! But first, we gotta start.
I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
So were done then!
Okay.
This is a glaucoma test.
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
How's it going?
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Oowww!!
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
Hmmm!
Oh my God!
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
Oh really?!
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Er, yeah, it's mine.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Wait a minute. What's his name?
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
Err... we know what we want.
Oh, thats good.
And some biscottie cookies.
Good choice.
Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Christmas eve.
Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Umm, I'm still here.
Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
No! It don't go up on the wall!
What-But you saw the show!
Dry cleaners?
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
He is?
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
It wasn't my decision!
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
You are really frightening me.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
All right, honey, time to start pushing.
But they're not here yet!
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
Uh-huh.
No-no-no-no-no we came together!
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...
Nooo!
Hey. Got a second?
Hello, sweetheart.
Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Is it on?
Hey!
Oh my God!
No. But that reminds me, sign this.
Noooooooo!
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
What is it?
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
That's great!
I don't know.
Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
Hi!
So that's the girl you like.
Yeah.
I got an extra one. You want this?
Stopped for a Chunky.
Let it go, Ross.
No.
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Okay.
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
Phoebe, what's the matter?
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Oh, right, that's me!
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
Hey.
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
Yeah.
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
You're not a senior?
Ok...ay.
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Really?
Wow!
You keep saying that.
Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
Sh-shh-shh!
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
Oh, Chandler.
Hi Chandler!
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
Well, I don't think this, y'know.
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
What, like a number?
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Oh yeah we do. C'mon.
Over here dad.
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Are you serious?
We are there!
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
Oh, hey.
Hi.
Yeah, I'm sorry man.
Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
Actually, that's our three hole punch.
Yeah, but wait...
Good bye!
Hey.
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
Thanks.
Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.
Yeah I can, it worked real well.
Yes?
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
I won't! Until I have my next cigarette.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
I am. I'm that stupid.
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
How little?!
Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
I can't!!
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
I'm fine, thanks.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
Nooo, four.
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
So, what did Francis leave me?
Huh?
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's oh it's-ew used. Umm, cool.
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
You're gonna do what to my clocks.
I'm gonna set them to my time.
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
Not me.
May I ask why?
I surely do!
Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
I don't see why not.
Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do?
Fine. I don't like you!!
So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
Nooo! Why would you think that?
I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Still doing the screening thing?
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
Bob here.
Oh my God! It didn't remind you of...
No-no really, was-was that not okay?
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
Don't say it!
No, but it did! Didn't it?!
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
You can watch our tape if you want.
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
Neil Sedaka wears them.
I hear you can get people out of here.
Yeah, like a chimney.
Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
I told that guy who answered your phone.
Well, you were fired.
Nu-uh!
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
Uh, Phoebe you-you don't have an office.
All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
No, you don't.
Why?
He started it!
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
Why?!
The sexy blonde behind the counter.
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
What?
Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
You have pets!
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought.
BEND OVER?!!!
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
...And what did you bring?
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Well...
But I hired you!
What?
It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
What is it, Tim?
So you're the gynaecologist?
Hey, I'm trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
You gonna slice them up real nice?
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
No really, they're OK.
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Aaaahhhhhhh.
I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
I gotta go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, now I'm really late.
Can-can we take a look at your ticket?
Okay. Uh, huh. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.
Umm, no, I don't think so.
Sure.
Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh...
They still want me for General Hospital.
I'm soo glad I caught you, I couldn't find you before.
Wh-wh-what's going on? Wh-what's this about L.A.?
But, but wh-what about us?
Last night was wonderful. But I-I can't stay here just for you.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Everybody has to audition.
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
I just had sex.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Oh.. Never mind. Who are you?
You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
Red Barbra?
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Well, can you blame her?
Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could...
So, do we have the best friends or what?
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
I will go for that drink.
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!
The game is over, we eat now?
Are you gonna let me play?
All right then.
No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
So are you his mother or his father?
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
It's lovely to meet you.
Jack!
What?! I've never seen one before!
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank.
Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria!
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
I do the same thing.
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th.
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
No! I went with Mindy.
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Oh.
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
I can't believe the guys missed this.
What guys? Oh, yeah.
Do I know you?
You used to be my babysitter.
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Yeah.
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
The sexy blonde behind the counter.
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
Why?!
Gunther?!
Your mother just added him to her list.
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
Huh?
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
You have three nipples?
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Yeah.
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
Good. So what were you thinking?
Really?
No.
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Oh. Thanks.
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
Okay.
When are you coming home?
I'll just run to the store and get some.
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.
Do you know where the store is?
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
Yeah.
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
How 'bout just a boom?
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
Umm, anyway...Do you want to have dinner tonight?
That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles...
Yeah.
Yes! Oh no!
Oh. Uh, what?
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
How do you do there, Wayne?
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
Who are you?!
What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother?!
That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!
Oh noo...
My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
Who is that?!
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Hi!
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...
Can you really do that?
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
I'm not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
In...in two weeks.
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!
What?
Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
Something about hi.
That's so exciting.
You know, actually it's more like, hi.
Hi.
Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Do you still work here?
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Great!
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
Can I get some ice here?!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Say what?
I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
Well, have fun!
Oh please God, let there be a song.
I've literally never been this happy.
Wasn't there a little song?
There was no song. There was no song!
'I am Bea.'
Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
What? You're leaving?!
Yes, we have something we have to get to.
No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
What big thing?
Well of course not, but you were very good.
That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!
Oh noo...
Thanks!
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
Oh no, you'll have to come.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
And tell him what?
Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
What?
Gum!
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It's looks like a curling iron.
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
What's this? Blue nail polish?
How's the hired help?
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
To get my coat.
No no no.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
Well, my goodness, what was that?
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
Did I put too much rum in here?
Of course.
Oh. Then, no.
Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
You'll see.
Oh God.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
I assume we're talking about the baby now.
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
I think it's great you guys are doing this.
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
He's Greek Orthodox.
As are you...
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
He took off?
Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
Hi.
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Uh, what was that?
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
No! No dessert, just a check, please.
Yes! Thank you.
So, would you like any dessert?
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Hey!
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
What?
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
So that's your second marriage in two years.
You got married again.
Yes.
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Yeah!
And thank you for your time.
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
Oh, sorry!
Oh that's okay.
So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Oh that's great! You are the best!
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
More wine, dear?
Oh, I think so.
Thank you. They're yours.
Actually they were Nana's.
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
I'm goin' home.
The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
So there is no good time to ask that question.
Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
So, I hear you're single now...
How did you? How? How?
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
Yeah, it sure does.
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
Pizza delivery.
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
Oh, sweetie, oh.
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!
Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
I can't do this.
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Good morning.
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
Ohh that's nice.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
Oh, this is my friend Roger.
Hi.
You too, sir.
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.
You got it.
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Why?
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.
Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?
Hey!
Hey.
Why?
You can pee here!
What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
Saltines?
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
I know.
Weird Girl, what are you doing?
Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
So uh, here's your office set!
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
I'm sorry, why don't we do that right now? He's right here.
You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
Rach, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
No it isn't, I ate that.
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
Hello.
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
You by the door. In or out?
In.
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
Yeah. Here you go.
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
Oh.
Let me get that. You got five bucks?
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
I thought he was with you.
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Why are you so jealous of me?
So, I got the results of the amnio today.
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
I'm pretty sure that it is...
Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
Totally and completely healthy!
Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
Ok. He kept my dollar.
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
I can show you an ID if you want?
Hi!
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know.
Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
This?
You wanna go down to the office right now?
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Doubtful.
Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux.
Dad, she won't want to go with me.
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Hey Rachel!
Hi!
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
Can I ask what-Come on in.
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
Yeah, of course, Donald.
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
Could everyone please take their seats?
What did you say to him?
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Okay.
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Uh, wait, backstage?
Ross.
Chandler.
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
You can't give up on your dream.
No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
Emily!
Oh my God! What are you doing here?
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
What's he talking about?
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
Yeah!
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
What one?
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...
Ross, there he is.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
Where are you Vic?
Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
In a minute!!
Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Mm-hmmm
Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?
Oh-oh, Phoebe!
Ooh! Hi!
Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
Yes.
You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
I-I like pizza!
Oh my God, so do I!
I knew it, wow!!
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Hey, you.
Hey, you.... So, what's up?
Sure we should... So.
Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
Your a poet and don't know it.
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
What?
The bll is drrbing!
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
You, you want, you want me to move out?
What?
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
Uh-huh.
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
I think that's fair.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
I know.
What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
What's going on over here?
Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
Ah.
Oh, hi, darling!
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
France sucks!
We want candy! We want candy now!
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Candy Lady?
I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
What?!
I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
It seemed like such a simple idea.
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"
I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.
What if they get mixed up?
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea.
You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
You mean like watch?
And what will that be on the side of?
You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
And for you?
Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
Oh. Then, no.
Did I put too much rum in here?
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Oh.
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
I'll take a look at him.
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
What?!
That chick can't handle my corner.
Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
You okay? You all right?
So we should probably get going soon.
Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
Would ya care to venture one?
For all the free food you gave away.
Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
What?!
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
You work and you work and you work on a boat...
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
...and you sand it and you varnish it...
That's exactly what my dad used to say!
Would you.......Would you hug me?
I'm a little busy here Paul.
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
Five more seconds.
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
You too, sir.
Dad, dad.
Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
I can still see you!
Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
Yeah, I'm all...in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
No!
Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
That's really a day shoe.
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
No, it really should be burgundy.
I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
Why?!
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
No.
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
Do you want a date Saturday?
Yes please.
He's a he?
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Lebanon.
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
How does it happen?
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
Thanks!
Okay! Hey Tommy.
Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Alright mister, let's see those panties.
C'mon.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Alrighty.
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Oh, really?
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Hi Kim.
Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Oh I...
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
No! Wait! Come on!
He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
You work and you work and you work on a boat...
...and you sand it and you varnish it...
...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you too.
Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
What?
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
Okay.
Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
No. No.
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
I am famished. What do I want...
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
Amy!
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
Sorry I'm late, what's up?
Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Just tell me the truth.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Oh, yeah. I know that.
Your mom called me. So is this her?
Ok. That's fine.
So how did you know I was even here?
No, this is a loaner.
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
What?
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Excuse me?
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
I don't know.
How do you mean?
Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
That's fine.
It is?
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
But you know what might really cheer me up?
I don't want to talk about it.
Okay, umm...
What?
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Well, whaddya think?
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Uh-oh...
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
Can we start over?
No, no, no!
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Thank you. All right.
Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
Okay.
So, what did Francis leave me?
Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
Hi! What are you doing here?
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
Hi!
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Oh, okay.
This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
Well, we were very young when we had her.
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Oh. We?
Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to...
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
So, uh, how's she doing?
How-how are you, Mom?
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
You brought a carrot?!
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
So who made her queen of the world?
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
I would love that job!
Hey! What's goin' on?
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Out!
Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Not.... helping!
You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
Are you gonna play?
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway...
Ooh-ho-ho!
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Rachel didn't you just light that?
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
Tell me about it!
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
You are so precious, I could just take you home.
Oh! Ooh! Umm!
Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
Hey, why don't you?
Are you serious?
Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
You don't think I'm cute?
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
I've got no reason to stay.
Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
Who-who else is in vice up there?
Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
I won't! Until I have my next cigarette.
Yeah I can, it worked real well.
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
What?!
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
I'll cancel the sodas.
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
You're an opthamologist.
Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
They're your backup singers... beind you.
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
Alrighty. From the top.
Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
This could've been hers!
Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Yeah, me too.
Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that.
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
Why, how much is that?
That's about 60 cents.
You've got panties stuck to your leg.
No you do. You... just...
What?
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
It's good to see you.
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Yeah, well..
Be right there. Be back in a sec.
I dumped him.
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
No! No! Not, Paris.
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Professor Geller?
Yeah?
Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Come on man! You've been here all day!
We're on in 3, 2,
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know...
Okay.
Why not?
Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,
I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
So you want to come inside?
Yes. Yes I do.
Guess who?
Department of Sanitation?
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
What?! Why?!
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
Sure.
Very good Monica! You know where they are.
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
I sure do! And you don't get one!
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
If this is your idea of sexy talk?
Sure.
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
What contracts?
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
Hey! Sugar-O's!
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
No, we don't.
Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.
And while we're on the subject of news..
So what's going on with you?
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
Look, look, I have elbows!
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
Movies?
I don't think so.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
Professor Geller?
Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know.
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Making out in your office.
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
Rachel. Hey.
Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
No.
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
So who made her queen of the world?
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Well, go ahead Rachel.
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Hey.
There is a little child inside this man!
Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
: That book got me through some tough times.
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Who's this from?
Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
What?
That's cool. Cool.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
Oh.
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
Monica Gellerrr.
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .
You really didn't have to. Wow.
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Oh, yeah... yeah.
Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
BEND OVER?!!!
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
You know where I work!
Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
I'm right here!!!!
Earl! I'm Phoebe.
Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Is Brian...?
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
This one?
One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
Hi!
Hi!
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
What?!
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Uh, yes.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
...I d'know.
You're one to talk.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
Bye.
Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.
We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
Alright, alright, ok. Bye.
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
Well, you kids take the train in?
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
Who's out there?
It's me! Good morning!
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
No.
We've come for her things.
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
Yeah.
I don't know what to do with that.
Yeah.
This is huge, you can buy me beer.
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Here's the thing.
Yeah?
Uh-hmm.
Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
Okay.
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
Lemonade? You ok man?
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
I fell down an elevator shaft.
That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
...I'm, I'm okay.
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
You got it.
Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
A tad.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
I just sold it to that gentleman.
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.
Umm, I thought about you all day.
Yeah.
Fuggetaboutit. How you doin?
Mmm.
He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
You're all invited to bite me!
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
That's me.
I'm him.
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
Anybody want a croan.
Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
It's my baby too.
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
All right, you two, stop it!
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
All right, thank you so much for all your help.
I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
Great.
Sure.
Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
Okay, that hurt us.
Well ah, ........y'know.
Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
This is huge, you can buy me beer.
Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
Yeah.
I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
I gotta friend named Mark.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Oh, great!
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
Really? About what?
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
She's talking.
Yay!
That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
Hello Tilly.
Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.
Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye.
Bye-bye.
You could kick anyone's ass you want too.
Oh my God!
...of course you can kick his ass son.
Thanks you guys.
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
All right, there you go!
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
Okay, good-good for you.
I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real!
Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
You didn't know that already?
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?
Yeah, they're not so bad.
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
So this is Brooklyn.
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh....
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
Well she said she had to think things over.
Okay, she was here, but she left.
Well where did she go?
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make...
Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
Yes, but there isn't always time!
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Yeah!
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Hi!
That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
You are so fired.
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Well have we finished the scene?
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Don't say it.
...in love with you.
Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
I can't believe you... ..did this.
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
Does he know?
Who?
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
What?
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
I'm sorry, let her?
What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
No.
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.
I almost forget the tickets, didn't I?
What?
Oh. Oh, right.
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
You're right, I know.
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday.
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
Really?
Someone I can spoil, y'know?
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
That's funny. Who are they?
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
You were gonna propose?
You know what makes the itching even worse?
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
That you don't stop talking about it.
Fine.
Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
It's the-Chandler!!
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Oh-ho, yeah!
Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
Hey! I missed you.
Oh, I missed you too.
Oh, so did I.
No tongue.
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
Morning.
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
No I don't think so.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
So Ross, what your problem?
Eh-wh-Excuse me?
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
The shipment never made it through Omaha?
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
Hi, you guys.
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
Hi.
Hi, Alan.
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
C'mon!
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Nooo!
It's worse than the thumb!
Hey, this is so unfair!
Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
Hey!
What are you guys doing together?
Really.
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
If that helps you.
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Uh.
Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
Oh, just updating the phonebook.
Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Just, you know, to see... um.
Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
...and you sand it and you varnish it...
You work and you work and you work on a boat...
He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
Me too!
Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
Oh, well, I'll show you around.
That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
Umm, is Tag here?
No. Why?
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
You're the only one who can save her Drake.
Hi Phoebe.
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!
Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
So what are you saying? It's now or never?
Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
No. I'm saying it's now.
Or?
No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
Sit down! We're winning!
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Okay..
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
Yes!!
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
And you?
I thought it was... quite tasty.
I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
That's not a state Joe.
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
Okay.
You're our age!
How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
Hey Joe.

Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Or if you prefer, this table is available.
Oh. Good to see you guys.
Yes.
That might be fun.
What were you thinking?!
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Ohh. . .K. How come?
Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
But we broke up.
Oh.
Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
You're not wearing the patch yet.
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Umm, jealous!
Yeah, no problem.
Ross!
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
Oh, that's sounds great.
I know a great little place.
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that.
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
I mean he just started going out with her.
Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
Alright.
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
Well, thanks, we like him.
My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
It's uh, $12.50.
Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
Gas? Wow! Intense.
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Daddy!
You're next!!
Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay.
Right, why do you keep saying that?
Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
Wait!
Oh, it's you.
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
I could have birds.
Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
All right, bye-bye.
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
Oh.
What-what's so funny?
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
But you know what might really cheer me up?
What?
Wow! Really?!
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
I wanna gooooooo!
That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
What happened son?
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
Wow! Thanks!
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
You are? Me, too!
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Gotcha!!
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Really?
Yeah.
No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Can't wait.
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
What?
Daaahhhh!
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
Then why would you say that?!
Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Oh my....
Got 'em.
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on.
It's open! Come in!
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
Please, can't you help me out?
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Sure. What's up?
Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
Oh, oh! It's on again!
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
Oh! You know what I need?
Yeah!
Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-
Also large?
Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Can I change a hundred?
Let's ride.
13.
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
Slides are almost ready.
Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
Oh great!
Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
Rachel?
No. How are ya Paul?
No, did he hug you?!
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
Happy Valentine's Day!
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Kiss me!
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Oh, okay, I get it.
Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
That chick can't handle my corner.
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Call security. Pheebs, didn't you get fired?
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Uh, I don't think so!
Phoebe?
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Yeah, isn't he?
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Huh. That's nice.
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
Do you want me to want you to care?
Do you?
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
Really?
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
Delaware! Delaware!
Be right there. Be back in a sec.
Yeah, well..
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
I dumped him.
Okay.
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Do you have any respect for your body?
So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
Oh, making it worse!
Okay.
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
That guy's going home with a note!
Could you speak up please?
Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Uh-huh!
Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?
Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
Um-hmm.
Mm! Night Gar'!
So did you read your evaluation yet?
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
Oh the humanity.
Meth-methane smells...
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
Wait, you can't take the money out.
But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
Okay.
Okay.
No, I'm fine.
See ya.
Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
Oh no! What's the matter?
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Okay.
Okay.
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
There's one thing missing.
What's that?
Okay.
Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
I fell down an elevator shaft.
What?
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
Woof, woof.

Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
Well...

Ross, when's this comet thing start?
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
Oh, you know what?

You ate my sandwich?
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
All those things I said about not being ready...
Hi.
Oh my gosh, Joshua!
They're not true?
No, they're-they're all true.
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
Yeah, she's fired.
You've done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.
Not so fast Wesley!
Remoray!
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
You have a Miss Monica Geller here.

Okay.

Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
No.
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Ross, it's too hard.
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
Ohh, okay.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.
Well, that was ah...
Better?
Ah, Kate?
Yeah?
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Oh great!
So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
What umm, what happened?
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
What?
Huuh.
Yeah, I know, I.
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
You dog!
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Okay, we'll give a call if anything comes up.
So it looks like you've got some great experience here. Let's see ahh, reason for leaving last job?
Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
Great! Thank you very much.
Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study. Uh, sir?
Yes he did.
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Uh.
Well that's his last name.
And his first name.
Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
Yeah?
Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Why not?!
Your mother just added him to her list.
The sexy blonde behind the counter.
Gunther?!
What? Your-your list?
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
A film in Guadalajara!
The airport?
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Eight months.
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th.
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
I do the same thing.
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
So when are you getting married?
Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
So, so, did you hear?
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
Wh-what's that?
It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
What?
How are you ever going to sell this place?
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining. . . oh no.
Bye.
Press the button.
Which one? Which button, Jack.
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Done.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm...
Wh-what's that?
Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
Yeah, thanks.
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Joey.
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
Whoa!
Oh my God!!!
No! No!
No, no?
Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
Ah, Cheryl!
Oh, Ross!
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little.
Would you like to move over to the couch?
Mmm-Hmm.
How about all the way.
Okay.
Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.
What?
The pizza-place across the street any good?
Okay!
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
What?!
I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
Okay, gimme my monkey back.
That's my monkey.
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
Alright, I want my monkey.
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Yes.
No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Even if he were... cornered?
Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere.
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
Oh hi!
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
No.
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
One swift kick and he'll back off.
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
Huh?
All right, bad ankle, got it!
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
It's okay, Rachel knows.
Yeah, but even soo.
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...
Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
Why?!
Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.
What?
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
You can watch our tape if you want.
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
I see. Have you considered therapy?
I think just the annulment for today.
Easy.
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?
So, are you a member of any gym.
No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
Hi, I'm Maria.
Wow, you have really pretty feet.
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Okay, I bought a boat.
You bought a boat?
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
No he, he moved out and I moved in.
Hello.
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
I know I would.
It's Petty. I'll be right back with your ticket.
Your license please.
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer...Pretty?
You have a son!
I know. I know.
...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Drink?
Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
Still smoking cigars?
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
Did you bring the toe?
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
Hi.
Hello.
What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
Maybe in L.A?
Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys.
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that?
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
So uhh, you ready?
Sure. Joey...
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Lose the robe.
What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
Yeah, well they suck too.
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Marcel! What've you done to him?
Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.
C'mere, Patti.
How could I have left them in the copy room?
It's not here.
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Fine.
Did not, she did not wink at you....
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Huh.
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
I-I-I think you look great.
I'll get her.
Please hurry.
Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
I look more like him than you do!
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
Are we still on that?
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
Can you believe this place?
There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Hey, kids...
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
But you found me!
Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
No, it really should be burgundy.
No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Oh my God..
I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
Ok, I'll walk you out.
Bye Ryan.
We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
What?
Are we really in Montreal?!
Yes we are. So, coffee?
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Oh! No problem! I...
What?
But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
That's us.
That's right, $2,000.
But, you're not identical twins.
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
Really.
Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
I'd like that.
Hey, gorgeous.
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Oh! Okay! Phew!
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
He might still show up.
Is that all?
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
I'm Tilly.
Oh.
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
He's kind of intense huh?
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
Oh, excuse me.
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
So, you'd hire me, right?
For what?
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
No, it's fate!
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
I'm actually the office manager.
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
Or so I would have you believe.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Alright, go on.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay.
Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Where is this party?
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
My friend's name is Joey.
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Ice coffee? Tell me it's ice coffee!
What is in the cup?!
Okay, it's coffee.
It's-it's hot...
Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! Huh?!
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Even if he were... cornered?
Well I, I don't know. Why?
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
Well, that could've been really awkward.
You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.
I want you out.
Where did you hear it from before?
Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or...
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
Oh that's nice.
Oh. Uhh...
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Ohh!
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
Ok.
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
What's up?
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
Yeah, that was real.
Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
Actually, it's kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
Okay, now I've really have to go!
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
How long do you want the cuffs?
At least as long as I have the pants.
How is she?
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
You'll see.
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Well, then who's been dead for five years?
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.
No you didn't!
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
There you go!
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
The only man I've ever been with is your father.
That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
Oh! What's new in sex?
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Here, I'll get it.
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Oh, great!
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
M-Me again?
Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.
Hey! Hey!
Who is it?
Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Well why shouldn't I?!
Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
What?
Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
Ohh! My God! Barry!!
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Surprise! Look who's back!
Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
You wear bi-focals?
Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
Well those are very popular frames.
Neil Sedaka wears them.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
Okay, great.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya.
So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?
Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
OK.
Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
You have pets!
Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
Really? You'll do anything?
Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Joey, do you work here?
No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
You can't have sex with her!
What'd you think I was, a hooker?
Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
Fine. I don't like you!!
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
I got an extra one. You want this?
No.
Dr. Franzblau, hi.
So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
Okay.
You wanna what?!
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
No. No, thank you!
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Well, I do.
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Hi!
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
Yeah. So...
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
Hey Monica, how's it going.
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.
We, we just wanna see the end.
I want you Drake.
What?
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
Oh!! Shrimp toast!
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Ohh, nice choice.
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Who?
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Umm, no. No.
Yes you did! What was it?
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Hey! Rachel!
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
Oh, I get a puppy!!
Why?
I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
Alright, alright, ok. Bye.
Bye.
Well you can split it with another credit card.
They prefer it if I don't barter.
Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you.
I'm just going to need to see your passport.
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
I did. Now I'm the idiot.
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Yes, tell me.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
All right, it's time to act, my talking props.
Cool! I-I'll see you then.
All right.
Hey!
Hey!
Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh?
Nice.
Is anyone else starting to really like him?
May I help you?
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.

Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.

Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
What is with him?
We never get smacked.
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
Umm, yeah! Today's.
'Cause uh, this is today's Post and uh, these are the listings I found. Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights!
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
Sir?
What's in it?
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Mr. Simon's been waiting for- Oh my God!
Suddenly, I very aware that I'm naked.
Okay, quit down.
Why wasn't I offered that? I'd definitely pay more for that.
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
Does it have to be a whole day?
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
What? What's what you were afraid of?
Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.
Hello! One marriage please!
Yep, we wanna get married!
All right.
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
I can show you an ID if you want?
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Oh, that must be it.
Well I hope you have fun tonight.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
Hi!
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
No, it's really good.
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
What?
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Bob Buttons?
Oooh! You are a very bad man!
You owe me a cat.
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
We never get smacked.
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
I'm sorry I... It's just there's no real spark.
Kinda.
Then change it back!
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah.
Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
What is with you tonight?
Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
No. It's the one he's licking.
She's supposed to be with you.
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Hey, it's good to see you!
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Well, my nose got lonely.

Life partner.
Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one and only boyfriend...
It's nice to have a boyfriend.
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
All right Ross!! I get it!!
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.
Hi, I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
Who are you?
I'm Chandler's new roommate.
I-I-I don't think so.
You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
Hey, what kind of work do you do?
Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea.
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
No.
Then what? What do you want?
Why on earth would I understand this?
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You don't even know me...
What?
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
I can't believe this!
Screw it! I'm having one.
3, 2, 1. Happy New Year.
Joey.
Yeah?
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
What?
Oh.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
Are we still on that?
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
And wait, I've got something for you.
Mark!!
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Yay!
You may kiss the bride.
Just keep smiling.
Okay.
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
She's a woman!
What can I say? She nailed it.
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.
Wow. Thank you.
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Well of course not, but you were very good.
Thanks!
Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
A film in Guadalajara!
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
You've been married twice?
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Do you two know each other?
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
You think so too?
No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Sooo, you've been doing this long?
Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice.
Dude!
Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday...
Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
Yeah?
What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
What? You didn't get one.
OK, well then what is this?
OK, that's my tattoo.
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Who's that?
Nobody.
Is that Mark?
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!

Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.

Well, he's doing terrible!
Really!
You're not just saying that are you?
No, the man is a mess.
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Yeah-No!!
Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that...hot dog.
Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
I'm so glad you liked them!
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
They don't look any bigger than me!
Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
All right.
Okay.
You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
Monana?
Yeah. It's Dutch.
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
You need to give him money.
I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
Hi! How are you?
Hello, Joanna......'s office.
How little?!
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
...of course you can kick his ass son.
Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
Oh my God!
You could kick anyone's ass you want too.
Thanks you guys.
Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.
What are you, what are you doin'?
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.
OK, see ya later, nice meeting you. You're welcome.
What?
Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
Oh, will you give me the thing.
Hi, Max!
Wow.
It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
You got me.
Right.
So, um, are you gonna call him?
What? Do you think he likes me?
Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
See ya.
So how you two gettin' along?
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
I did not!
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
I am so hot for you right now.
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
What?
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
She's right there.
Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
The only problem!
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Pat Sajak?
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
Um, cheers.
Oh, right, clink.
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
See he's nice. Right?
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
I saved you a seat.
Sick-sick-sick-sick.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you.
Me too.
Well, that' me. Here, have this. I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
Bullies, big bullies.
Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.
Yes, and that's why we're here.
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
Right. Could you sign this?
No. No way, I'm not signing that.
How can they do this to me?
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
You don't have, anything?
You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
Marlon-
Marlon?!
...As in Mouse?
As in my grandmother.
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
No! No!
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
...Now that was fun.
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
The fake kind!
We have a ladle.
Thanks, see you at the party.
You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
Hey!
Ahhhh!
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
Okay, well g'night.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
Hi everyone.
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
Wow!
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
You think I'm hot?
Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
Yeah, I'm ready.
You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
My god, what happened?
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
Mockolate.
I'm sorry?
Ohh.
Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...
She wasn't a hooker.
Okay, on three. One....Two....
Why don't we just go on two.
Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
Bye.
Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
Umm, oh, hey, I don't know. How about a big one?
But my apartment is so...
Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I'm sorry!"
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
Were you this cute in high school?
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
Call me!
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
The picture of my wife! In your pack!
You went through my personal property?
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Cut! Wonderful!
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
We agreed on Minnie.
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
Oh, that's great.
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
It was fine.
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Are you talking about having sex?
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
What did Joey say? I like you back?
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Wow.
Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!
Still rolling, annnnd action!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
Here comes the bride.
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
I know. I like it up here.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Thanks!
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
You know where I work!
I do?
You still work at the multiplex?
Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!
Yay!
See? Here we go.
Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
Paul!
Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
Ok.

Oh, you and me?
Uh, no, Susan and me.
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.
Why?
I can't sleep now.
You want me to sing?
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Hi.
Hi, hi can I help you?
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
Thanks for dinner last night.
Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
Like what?
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Now, let us try that again, shall we?
This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
What are you saying?!
No! Ooh! Oh my god!
The Waltham Residence.
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
Then, you're redoing it because...
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Oh, well that's not so crazy.
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
No, I mean it's not Geller.
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
It's my baby too.
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Oh my God, what happened?
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
This is unbelievable.
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Maybe.
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
There it is.
What is going on?
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Joey!
Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.

Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!
Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there.
You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
Ross!
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
Sure! That would be nice.
Umm?
I will give you a call.
I'll see you later.
Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
I have a question about this scene.
Yes?
Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
Yeah.
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
Uhhhh.
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
I don't think so dear.
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
No way! It's mine!!
What?! What?!
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
You told me you didn't see anything.
I tell ya a lot things!
Stay well.
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
It's a different guy!
Good evening officer.
Ah no. I don't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
You're right. It was 37.
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
Yeah, I'm with Mon.
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.
No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Oh, I never could do it.
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
You too.
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
Sophie's desk.
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
A lesbian?
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
Why- why are you here, Carol?
I'm pregnant.
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
I'm not reading this!
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
We're very happy for you.
Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
Sure.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Okay.
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
No! Why does he have to go?
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
So how are you doing?
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
Well, thanks, we like him.
My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
Well, tell him, apology accepted.
Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
Oh!
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
Um... Done!
Hey!
No, these are my pants.
Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
Mom, it's OK.
It is Judy.
Found it.
I'll take that dad.
Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.
C'mon hurry, hurry.
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
OK.
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
Goodbye Geller.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
Call me.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
All right. I can't see.
All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
Gotcha.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
I love you too.
Aw, it's soo unfair.
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...
Hello, sweetheart.
Uh, we are here to break up with you.
Both of you?
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
Ooh, nice.
Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life...
No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.
Oh, am I on the radio?
No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
Hey!
How come? Everybody else does.
You can't.
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
Vince is a fireman.
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
Dude.
Our little boy is getting married.
Oh look at you! So handsome!
But-but this block is like a whole other world.
I...I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Ah.
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Smooth.
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
Guess what, I got an audition!
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
You bet! What's the part?
Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Oh, no! No!
Then you hold on to it!!
All right, man!!
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
Hi Rachel.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
That's not true?
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
You gotta do it, man.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
Geller!
Hey, Fun Bobby!
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
You and me both.
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.
Doubtful.
Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault.
Oh o-, OK man.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.
Monica.
They won't take you to the vet.
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Hi Joey.
Hey! How you doin'?
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Okay, good. Thank you. I'll be back shortly, all right?
Okay.
And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer.
All right. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!
Hey!
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
What?
Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
Oh, okay.
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Yeah. Yeah. A little.
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..
Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!
Wow.
Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
What?
Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Ross? Let's go.
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
That's a plane!
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
No. No, you can't.
What?
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
I'm going commando, too.
Awwww!!!
Wow! What a pleasure.
Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
What?!
Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
No, I think it's cute.
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
Ohh, I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
Yeah! Yep.
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Why are you yelling?
Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight.
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
Always illegal Joe.
Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
No, I ahh, had another idea.
We did it!!
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Okay, great.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
We're switching rooms again.
Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
Is that supposed to be me?
Yeah.
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
Well, I feel like a snack!
That's the best one! Oh my God, thank you so much!
She took all my stuff.
Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
Well. Hey...
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Oh cool! You made him cry!
Umm, well, what else could it be?
It's kidney stones.
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
I know that!
I'm sorry, let her?
What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
Really?!
Ohh!
Really?!
Yeah!
You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
He has a gun!
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
That's what I'm telling you.
Did you cut this couch in half?
The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
All right. This is the kitchen.
Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom?
We're still on this side of the door.
Um-hmm.
Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
So, all right.
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?
But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
Yeah, kinda.
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
You know Paul?
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Hi! What-what're you doing here?
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
Really?
Yeah.
Thinkin' about it.
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday.
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
You're right, I know.
Okay.
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
Yeah.
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
How are we gonna get out of that one?
What?
What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
I don't know, they're just a little blah!
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
What?
And I too am just a love machine.
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Yea-huh! That's what is says on my birth certificate.
Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31.
Nu-uh!
You have your birth certificate?
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
Oh my God, I'm married!
I know.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Wow! Sure! That's great!
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Okay. You ready to push again?
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that?
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Hey! What are you doing here?
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
Ok, you can not do this to me.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
I hope she throws up on you.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
It's about your monkey. It's alive.
Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
I was laughing.
Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.
No-no, thank you.
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Oh yeah we do. C'mon.
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.
...says $30 Father; same as in town.
All right, check me out.
Okay.
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Really?
Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to...
Well, we were very young when we had her.
Oh. We?
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
Let go!
Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What's the thing?
So? I mean have you thought about it?
Okay. Here's the thing.
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's-that's what you're worried about? If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
Oh, I'm threatened by you?
Yes.
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
Mine? Right here?
How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Move!
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
I'm with Hamilton!
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Uhh, actually y'know what, I kinda-I have to take off.
Gloves?
Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!
Oh.
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Uh, wait, backstage?
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
Waitressing?
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
What's that?
Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Hello Tilly.
That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye.
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
You gotta take the canoe!
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
Good for you!!
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
Were you following me?
Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.
He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
That's terrible.
Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
You never know.
What? So you never went out with an actress before?
What?
I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Kate, do you even like me?
Of course I do.
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
I'll call you back.
So we can be friends who sleep together.
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
Hello Ross. I love what you've done with this space.
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Thank you so much.
How hot is this?!
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
Hey!
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
You know her?!
No, I umm, I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
My job!
Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future &#150;and-and-and we were getting married or something.
Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
Oh, thanks!
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
Yeah!
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
Okay, then maybe I can come too!
All right, you go.
Bye-bye.
Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.
When's your birthday?
May fifth, why?
Oh, mine's December...
Yeah, whatever.
How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
Hi!
Hi!
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
Oh.
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
No problem.
Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
Hey, where are we going to lunch?
I was thinking Chinese food.
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
Any time you're ready, Joey.
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Sure. What?
Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Sounds great.
Okay.
Ready?
Ready!
Uh no, they're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
Do you not want to be seen with me?
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Hi!
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Sure. So how long you been...
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
This bill for my half of the wedding. it's insane.
What the hell!!!
what's up, Dad?
How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
Shall we?
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Why?
Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and-
Did you bring the toe?
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
What?! What is it?
You brought a carrot.
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
You have a son?
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
You're back.
It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
Hi!
Monica! Hi honey.
Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
Yeah, that's right.
I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
Come on over here, sweetheart.
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I know honey, I'm sorry.
So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
No. You?
No. Why?
Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
Oh, you're sweet and cute.
I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
You have?
Well, this is none of my business.
Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
Who drank all the Kamikazes?
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dead.
Aaaaagggghhhhh. Mommy
Cut.
Hey.
Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
We've only known each other for six weeks!
You are mad!
No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
My parents are going to be really mad.
Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Rough numbers?
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
Uh, if you say so sir.
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.
What can I say? She nailed it.
Okay, is there anything else?
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
Phoebe!
Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
Oh.
Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
That's weird, she locked the door.
Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Stay out of my freezer!
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
Uhh, not that I know of.
That - that's an idea.
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
Phoebe, come on!
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
What?!
Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
Do you have any tissues?
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Honey.
I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm...
You make up songs?
Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
Well, I am.
Not yet, no.
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
Ross, there he is.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
You completely stole my answer!
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
You think so too?
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
Umm, yeah-no thanks.
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
I know!
I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Hello! Here we go!
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
What?! Why?
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
Rach?
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. Are you all right sweethart?
I'm not all right.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
Hey guys.
No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone!
What?!
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
How long you been waitin' to say that?
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
Aaaaagggghhhhh.
Cut.
Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?
You're good. You're good!
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Thanks a lot.
Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
She's right there.
I love you sweetheart.
You look beautiful. Is this new?
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
Oh, no no no no no.
No no no no.
Impressive.
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
Very good.
Thank you.
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
Oh?
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Hi, I'm Lisa.
Hi.
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
Hey guys.
Hey!
Ahh, no, I'm good.
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
Hi.
We'd like to close our accounts.
No-no.
No, we'd just like to close them.
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
No, I had sex in high school.
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss...
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! Gotcha.
C'mere, Marcel.
C'mere, Patti.
Okay, gimme my monkey back.
That's my monkey.
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
Your mother just added him to her list.
What? Your-your list?
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
Me neither.
3, 2,
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
Joey.
You look good.
You don't say.
So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Ohh, how is he?
Isn't he an architect now?
Yeah, they still wear underwear.
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
Uhh, actually y'know what, I kinda-I have to take off.
Oh.
No! Nothing!
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
What's this?
What?!
What?!!!
Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
There's the man.
He-he-eyy.
Ok. He kept my dollar.
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
You.
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
How can you not remember us kissing?!
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
American Express?
I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Let's take it from there.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
What are you guys doing here?
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
Oh, well, I'll show you around.
That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
Ahh!
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so...
Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
Yeah! Got it!
Hey.
Hey.
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
What about when I started dating Chandler?
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
Did you cut this couch in half?
This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh!
He told me in person.
That's weird.
Hi, again.
Hey!
Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey.
Okay.
Umm, hi.
Dude, we got to talk.
Okay.
Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.
Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother.
Oh Drake.
Some guys are just lucky I guess.
Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
Y-, y-, you like that show?
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
And I'm going to go get drunk.
No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Me?!
No! I went with Mindy.
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
You're not even giving them a chance!
They have racquets don't they?!
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
How do I look?
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
...And what did you bring?
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
I will, I will find him.
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Just the last two pages.
What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Why not?
The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
No?
Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.
Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Well...I Only Have One Thing To Do Today. I guess I could push it back.
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
See, this is a great apartment.
Shut up! This place is a hole!
Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
He does that?!
Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Oh my God!
Oh wow! This is so cool.
Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Hi Emily!
Hi!
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
So what does this mean?
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Oh.
Hey Joe.
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
Uh-huh.
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he...
Hey Rachel!
Hi!
Gay? Yeah.
Hey! Terry.
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
Woah.
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
Your last roommate's kidney?
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Lemonade? You ok man?
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
You told me I was the only one.
Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
Somebody wanna help me out here?
Oh, I know, I know.
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
I'll make some calls.
Ok.
I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
Taxi.
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
Bye Ross.
Bye.
Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
Phoebe Buffay?!
Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
That's not mine.
Yes it is.
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
Buy mommy.
We love you. Buy.
Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!
Hi, Pheebs.
Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
-leg?
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Ooh, steer clear of you.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Rachel! That was a library card!
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Rachel! That was a library card!
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Twenty-four actually.
Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
Well, I'm not gonna talk because...
Damnit Carl!
That's us.
But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
Oop!
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Who the hell are you?!
I'm Joey! How are you doin'?!
...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....
She seems fine now.
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Whoa.
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
Well, that could've been really awkward.
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
So ask me what I did today.
So what did you do today Pete?
What?! Oh.
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.
I'm Gail.
Chandler.
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
It's not that bad.
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
Sure. Okay.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
You mean scared.
No, I mean happy.
I'm sorry, why don't we do that right now? He's right here.
Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
Okay.
Joey Tribbiani, this is...
Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
Fine, whatever.
What's the matter?
What?
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
I think you're done.
Okay, time to take off the bra.
Take the bra off.
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?
Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
Shut up!
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Oh please...
Are you?!
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
Give me the dice.
No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
No.
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Become a drama critic!
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Oh, classy.
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Which one?
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
For all the free food you gave away.
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
No!

Okay! See you later!
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!

Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!

Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
Oh-ho, yeah!
Yep!
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?
Thanks!
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Yeah, welcome.
Hello. Hello.
Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
Really?!
Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
On your back... Mom.
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Oh.
I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
Im gonna be a father.
This is just occurring to you?
There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
Still no smile?
Ameri-can.
Ameri-ccan.
Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
Yeah.
So is it like art?
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
No, I wanna melt it.
Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
Shh! No! Joe Hill!
You just said...
But...
Oh my God!
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
You ate my sandwich?
Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
No.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
Um, thank you for the gift.
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
Uh, the book?
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Wh-what?! Why?!
It's a money thing, we don't have any.
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
Honey, it isn't good luck.
Oh my God! Monica!
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
Why?
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
Hi.
Hey.
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
You did it twice?
Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
Joey.
It wasn't my decision!
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
Yeah, baby!
What are you doing?
I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Hangs up.
Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
No. No. I don't think so.
What's that?
That's-that's my nubbin.
I wonder how long that milk has been setting out.
How about Mama Lisettie's?
Enh. Sure!
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
What? Why?
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Uh-huh.
Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
Nobody does honey.
Hi.
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
What are these, stitches?
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
Mr. Simon's been waiting for- Oh my God!
Why wasn't I offered that? I'd definitely pay more for that.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
Or Spin the Bottle?
He's not 11!
What? You're leaving?!
Yes, we have something we have to get to.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
'We' would be me and Rick.
I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.
No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
Oh my God, I didn't...
Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Who told you that?
Oh uh, one of the writers.
Umm...
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Kiss her! Kiss her!
I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
Thank you, Max. Thank you.
So-so you're really not going?
Oh don't do that.
Please.
Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Okay.
Ohh, okay.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
Hi Kim.
Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
Mmm-Hmm.
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
OK, well, bye-bye again.
OK.
Oh, no no no no no.
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Oh umm, uh we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
That'd be great, thanks.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Well, this has been fun.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
Oh, no.
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
Well, this all looks good.
Great.
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
Alright, let's take this outside.
Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
You had to ask.
Yeah.
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
M-Me again?
Sure! Why not?
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
How do you mean?
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
No, just a salad will be fine.
You got it.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
I'm sorry, I do that.
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
Hi Chandler!
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
What?!
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
Slides are almost ready.
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Uhhhh.
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
What umm, what happened?
Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
Even when we were having sex in that chair?
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
Ohh. Like what?
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
I'm soo glad I caught you, I couldn't find you before.
Joey!
Hey!
Wh-wh-what's going on? Wh-what's this about L.A.?
They still want me for General Hospital.
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
No.
I see.
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Dry cleaners?
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
You're our third call tonight.
Really?
I brought you something.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
You and me both.
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Umm...
Okay.
And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Yes.
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Um-hmm, five actually.
Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Oh!

You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?

I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know.
Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.
Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know.
You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
Home is Home Star stew.
Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
Mm-Hmm.
Hmm-Hmm.
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
Alright...
OK, try this salmon mousse.
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.

Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
How do you know Frank?
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
Thanks again, Dr. Green.
All right.
Oh, ah, you don't need that.
Why not?
No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Well uh, do either of you smoke?
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Who isn't?
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
Nevermind!
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.
It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
Frozen lasagnas?
Um-hmm.
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
No.
Yes! Totally!
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
All right, I can't wait!
He has a gun!
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
Let's see, ahhh... Where does the Pope live?
He painted that.
Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
Mmm-Hmm.
Mmm.
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
Whoa! Hey-hey! What's going on here? Who is this guy?
Hey!
I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.
I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
What?!
Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight.
No, sir.
Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
What was that?
What?
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
Okay.
He might still show up.
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Okay.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
You can say that again Mac.
Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
So, what did you guys think?
MY SISTER'S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
No it's not!
You guys! You guys! You're gonna have a baby! They're gonna have a baby!
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
Oh!
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
What?
Hey, how, how did you do that?
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Not unless different means the same.
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
Yeah.
And! We also have speaker phone.
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
It really says that?!
Yeah. See?
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?
Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Do you say this stuff to girls?
And look where they're sitting.
You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
So what's going on with you?
And while we're on the subject of news..
Look, look, I have elbows!
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
What's it look like?
Kinda like a big face without skin.
Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about.
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
Argue with that.
What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
I know that!
So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present.
Oh. Oh.
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
Thank you.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Isn't there?
Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.
Hi!
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Oh, okay.
I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.
Well you, her, I mean, she's very...y'know. And you're like...y'know.
What's that supposed to mean?
Ross!
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Really? You two?
Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
You don't say!
Good luck, babe.
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
JOEY!!!!!!
So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
You mean a three pointer?
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Surprise!!!
Surprise!!
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
Certainly.
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
God. You seem really, really nice.
Okay, bye-bye.
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
I hate you!!
And, I love you!!
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
Yes, Waltham interiors.
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
No! Phoebe!
Hey, Monica!
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.
Yeah! In... really long hour world.
What?
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
Yeah?
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Really?!
Ross is Batman!
Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
Joanna passed away last night.
Oh my God! How?!
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
I know!
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Okay then!
Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
What?
You still have feelings for me don't you?
Pete.
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Well, no. But...
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
Hi Rob Dohnen.
Oh, wow.
Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
Oh, say no more!
We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
Yep, sucks!
Hi you!
Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
Why?
You can pee here!
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
This will just be my batch.
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
What?
One more chance Ursula, please?
Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
Hey you guys!
Hey!
Oh, absolutely!
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.
OK.
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
This is for the fourth grade.
Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
I surely do!
Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
Let's do this alright.
Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
Alright, let's do this.
Alright.
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
You wanna go down to the office right now?
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Hey Erica, c'mon in.
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?
You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
Yesss?
Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
What does that mean?
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
I take it.
Good, you guys are all here!
Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
Heavy.
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
Well I'm sorry.
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
...from the syphilis.
What?!
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
It's dry.
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Oh, Kim, Hi.
Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
C'mon in.
Are you sure?
Huh?!
So, how ya doin?
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
Yeah.
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. It's a joke.
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
Ugh!
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
Joey!
Yeah?
Uhh do it?
That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times!
Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
Well there's one and there's another .
Lovely to meet you.
Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.
We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Ah actually, that is mine.
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
I am so attracted to him right now.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
Alright mister, let's see those panties.
Alrighty.
What?
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
Hey, I'm trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
So you're the gynaecologist?
Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!!
Thomas, come back here!
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
Well yeah.
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
717? Where's 717? Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?
Ross, thank God.
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
That's okay.
You sure?
...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
Hey, can I ask you something?
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
You guys, he's beautiful!
Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
How 'bout Ben?
I like Ben.
Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
Can I ask what-Come on in.
Okay.
I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Gotcha!!
Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.
Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
Thanks.
Wow!!
Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Oh, good point.
Yeah!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
Smelly cat, smel-ly cat...
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
I think you smell great!
Absolutely!
I am so on board!
All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
That's a defense?
Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Hi Rachel.
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
What a sweet story.
Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here!
Monica and Rachel made out.
Morning's here! The morning's here!
Hey! You're back!
Hey! Get into gear!
Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
No.
Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
My joke wasn't funny.
Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
Yeah, I'm good.
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
What?!
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
All right, you have yourself a deal.
Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
Did you really hear a bear?
Go-go!
Ohh, thank you.
I'm so happy that you're here.
Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
It's just I miss her so much.
I know.
Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'
Y'know what?
Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
So, have you kids eaten yet?
Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
So... We go eat.
Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
Oh, me too.
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
Hey, Pheebs!
Right. Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Yeah.
Go get 'em Treeger.
Really?
Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she's the same size as me.
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
OK, is this really my father?
OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
Look, I. . .
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
Found it.
I'll take that dad.
That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
Dad, I'm the twinkie.
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
Minsk. It's in Russia.
I know where Minsk is.
So when, when do you leave?
January first.
Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
Huh?
Hi.
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Thank you. Uh...
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Oh, nobody's judging you.
Oh! Okay! You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
Ready.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
Do you have a plan?
I don't even have a 'pl'.
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
What?
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
But it really...
Damnit!
Rach? Hi!
I...I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
I-I am Kristen.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
Ah.
But-but this block is like a whole other world.
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
Oh that's me, I gotta go.
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
Hi!
Hi!
Awww.
Thanks a million.
Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Oh my God. I think you're right.
Oh, Liam.
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.
Oh. Oh, right.
Oh yay!
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Uh huh.
Oh, you've tasted it.
Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
Howdy.
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
I thought of a thing.
Yeah?
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Or so I would have you believe.
Yes. Uh, can't you wait until tomorrow? All right. Unbelievable!!
No, we are. I'm sad.
Okay.
Thanks.
No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
Then, what's the problem?
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
No, don't say it.
That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Hey.
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.
Okay, I'll do it.
You'll do what?
Oh my God!
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.
1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Okay.
Okay. Okay!
Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
Uh, yes.
So what happened?
Oh sweet Moses.
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Say more things like that.
I'd need an expense account.
Done!
See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
Uhh, yeah.
We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.
And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth's here! Who are you talking to?
I'm so happy that you're here.
Here I am!
Uh, you guys?
How did you know we were here?
Why is this happening to me?! I don't know, maybe it's my wound.
What happened?
I...
Forget it.
So it's-it's not heeled yet?
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
When?
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
No, it's you!
Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
Can I please see your face?
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just-that was my puppy.
But Phoebe...
No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
Oh!
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
Oh my god.
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
That could be it.
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
Shut up!
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Did you bring the toe?
Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
That one will.
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Hi, how's it goin?
Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
Yes?
Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
Yeah.
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
What are you doing?
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
You chipped in?!
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
Um-hmm.
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
So um, who was she?
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
Hi there!
Hi!!
What are you talking about?!
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
I'm sorry.
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-
No, I umm, I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
You know her?!
There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?
Hang on.
I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
I-I think we have too.
Okay. Bye.
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
That's cool. Cool.
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Do you?
Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
All right, I can't wait!
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away?
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
I won't speed.
I promise.
And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
Oh, well we cut the trip short.
France sucks!
Oh, say no more!
We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Is there a problem?
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
Oh, what did I say?
Hmm, noodle soup.
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
Who in the hell are you?
I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
You're in this picture?
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!


C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.
Wow!
What?
Really?
Yeah.
Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Great!
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
Okay.
Oh man!
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
Where the hell have you been?
We stopped at the gift shop.
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
I used to have that bumper sticker.
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
Yeah! Got it!
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Oh.
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Did anybody call for security?
You be cool.
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Way to be cool, man.
Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?
Where did you get this number?
I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.
Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.
Oh, am I on the radio?
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
Two years.
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
You don't have it anymore?
No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
It didn't.
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
No, I don't know him.
Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
I-I sure will, take care.
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
No thanks, Mom!
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Very good, so good.
See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
No.
Oh.
Oh, okay.
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
It's like this, me, no jokes.
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
Bye, Richard.
Bye sweetie, I love you.
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
Summer catalogue!
That's the stuff!
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
Bing! That's a great name.
Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
So am I!
Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and...
Oh well...
I can handle the stick!!
Gay!
That can't be your father.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.
I can't do that.
Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
I can't imagine why.
Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
I really like waking up with you.
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
Well, that makes sense.
Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them...
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Who? Me the attacker?
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
July. Umm,
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
He's not here right now.
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler.
Uh, moist, yeah.
Let's dry 'em again.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
Hey!
Oh, I wouldn't miss this.
Well, I'm very glad you're here.
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
No come on. Come on tell me.
Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
G'night.
Ah, are you okay?
I don't know.
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
Oh, you just know.
Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
...and you sand it and you varnish it...
...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
...the scotch and the cigarettes...
...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...
Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
Come on!
Come on! Speech!
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
I think it's necessary.
Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
Humm, really?
Uhh, not that I know of.
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
Well, have fun!
Okay.
I have a feelin'... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.
Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
What's the matter?
How do you know?
Well y'know, he's got access.
We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
And the spitting?
You gotta hear this story.
200 at least.
...and this guy...
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
Joey Tribbiani, this is...
Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
How do you do there, Wayne?
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
No!
Sorry!
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
5 6 7 8!
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
Yes!
Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Well...
Oh no-no-no...
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother?!
I don't think so.
Who are you?!
Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
Really? I'm a hero.
Oh, this is so hard.
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
My parents are dead.
Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
And I'm going to go get drunk.
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
Great. It's gym class all over again.
Aww.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Well, thanks, we like him.
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
No, that was clenching.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
You got that from what I said?!
What happened you guys?
Rach!
I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
Wh-what?
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.

Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Shhh.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life.
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
Yeah, I know.
What?
We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
Three babies?
I finally got my band!
Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Why would we be freaked?
Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.
Some guys are just lucky I guess.
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?
No, no, they only said you.
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
'Sup?
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you're just so, you're so, so...
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
Last night was wonderful. But I-I can't stay here just for you.
They still want me for General Hospital.
But, but wh-what about us?
Well, so, stay for the museums!
I'm sorry.
Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.
Honey.
Oh.
Oh.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
That guy Lipson?
No, I, I only know Lipson.
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
Sorry.
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Ross!!!
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
Uhh, no-no thanks.
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
I'll be right back. What was that?
Right, I've got to be off, I'll see ya. Buh-bye then.
I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. It's a joke.
Bye.
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
What did I tell you about the hall?!
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
Is everything okay?
What's going on?
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
You okay man?
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
This couch belongs to us.
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
Fellas, these guys were here first.
What's up? You're voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
Hey, Rachel.
Hi!
Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you.
Great!
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
What?!
Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
Twenty percent.
Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
Hi, is Rachel there?
And who may I say is calling?
Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
I know!
Oh?
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
What time?
Gotcha.
I'm kidding!
Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
'Scuse me?
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
I'm afraid so.
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
I heard ya.
Ready.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
And that's the only colour that comes in.
Oh!
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Lovely, just lovely.
Really? Thanks.
Excellent, I'll be there.
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
I don't think so.
Why?
What?
Oh my God!
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
On your back... Mom.
Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
Six dollars, please.
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
I can help with that.
Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I'd cry.
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
I'm Megan Bailey.
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips...
Spring vacation.
Spring vacation.
Professor Geller!
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
The best man? Wow!
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
What?!
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Marcel?
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.
Neat.
Cool.
I know.
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
Yeah.
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Oh.
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
I know the code to his answering machine.
Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
"You have two new messages."
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
It didn't.
Now, wh-what, what is that like?
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
She's there?!
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
Oh, ooh.
Huh.
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Ow!
Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Ah well, this is the living room.
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
Wh-what?
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Oh, hi Danny.
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Sure! Why not?
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
How do you mean?
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
It's not all juice!
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
What do you mean?
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Well....
Why wasn't I offered that? I'd definitely pay more for that.
Okay, quit down.
Mr. Simon's been waiting for- Oh my God!
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
Cut! Wonderful!
Great scene yeah?
Thanks a lot.
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
You guys tell them you were married?
No way!
Coffee.
Thank you.
Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about.
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.
See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
So, um, what do you do for a living?
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
what's up, Dad?
This bill for my half of the wedding. it's insane.
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
Why?
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
You're strict.
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
Hi!
Uh-oh.
Is there a problem?
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
I believe you know my husband.
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
July. Umm,
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
A bitch?
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Wow!
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
How to make the next one even shorter?
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
Are you yelling at me?!
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
Why are you so jealous of me?
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Who?!
So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
Okay.
I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Really?
Yeah?
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?
Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
Do you have a minute?
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
Oh really?!
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
Wow.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Relieved?
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
Yes it does.
But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
Ohh! A man with a plan!
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-Wait! Did you write this?
Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
I am very...very sorry.
Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
How close?
I don't even know how that would work!
Well, we were...
Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
Yes because uh, you look so young.
And because you're both, you know, white women.
NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...
Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
I'll give you $1 for them.
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
Joey was in a porno movie.
Huuh.
Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom?
Impressive.
All right. This is the kitchen.
The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
We're still on this side of the door.
They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
What if you put them here.
Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
It's all right. Sweetheart.
Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Who was that?
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
Not her.
So, um, will you bring the truck?
I'll even let you ring the bell.
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
Youre doing it again.
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
You dont even have cats.
I could have cats.
Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
Really?!
Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
Then we agree?
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
Hey hey, come on in!
Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
I'm pretty sure that it is...
So, I got the results of the amnio today.
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
But how about tomorrow?
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
So oysters, huh?
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
Ohh! Didn't know! Okay!
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
What a wank!
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
Oh great!
Oh, sorry!
Oh that's okay.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
You obviously can't keep away from her.
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
You're right.
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there's an age difference between us.
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
Good luck, babe.
Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
JOEY!!!!!!
You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
It was fine.
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
Yes!
Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
What's going on over here?
Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
But...
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.
I think we have an answer.
Whats she doing here?
Think she got fired at Riffs?
No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... ..bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Well I just thought...
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
Oh my God!
What?
Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
Yeah.
I like this song.
Oh, no, no.
What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
You wanna go down to the office right now?
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
I like that.
Huh?
One swift kick and he'll back off.
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
That was you?
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking...
Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
What?
My drinking?
Oh, I must've said that after you left.
This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
Oh, okay.
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
All right, see ya Pheebs.
Rachel's coming up the path. Doesn't she look pretty. Jack...
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
I KNEW IT!!!!
Oh my God.
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
God! What are you, in second grade?
Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
Hi!
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
No, I was working on my pottery.
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to...
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Yes I did.
Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
That's not so good.
No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
I'm in love with you.
So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
Oh hello, Ross.
Hi, Mrs. Green.
Oh Mom!
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Okay.
Hey! New wallet, huh?
There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.
What?
So what happens next?
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
This one's from me.
Ahh!
A scooter!
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
So ah, what's wrong with him?
Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it.
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
Hi-hi Joey.
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Zelner.
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
Oh! You are?
Um-hmm.
Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Uh-hmm.
No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
Phoebe?
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
No. Sorry.
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
You-you have to meet me in the middle here.
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
After what he just said, you're paying for the whole bloody lot.
Yes, yes, do go on.
He better go on for what I'm paying.
I think we'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross...
I, Ross...
Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Really?
Okay. Cool.
Oh hey! Here they are!
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
Oh Mom!
Believe me, sometimes that happens.
This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
You're paying for that.
What? No-no it's her birthday!
But it really...
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
I guess it's worth a try.
What?! What?!
We appear to have angered it.
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
Why's that?
I don't think I should say.
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Hey!
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?
Ohh, that's a good one.
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
Uh-huh.
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
Right, like the kind you...
Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
Oh Drake.
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
We, we just wanna see the end.
Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
Oh my god! Youre amazing!
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
What?
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
You're an opthamologist.
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
See.
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
I'm sorry?
Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Wow!
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
No thanks.
Thank you. What a bitch.
Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
See? Here we go.
Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!
Paul!
Phil.
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
Okay.
No. What?
Barmifsaed?
So to get this part you can't be?
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
Action!
I found the picture!
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
I've had a really good time tonight.
Mmm.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.
Are you going to eat that bread?
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
Yea-huh! That's what is says on my birth certificate.
You have your birth certificate?
Our mom.
Right! Okay.
And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
One second.
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
I'm so glad you liked them!
Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Um-hmm.
Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
Chandler?
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
No, did he hug you?!
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Hey Chandler?
With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
I love working with designers!
Hey! My first review is out!
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
You want me to sing?
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?
Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
What the hell is this?
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
Oh well, it's not so bad.
Oh!
My God!
Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife...
Hi, I'm Joshua.
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
Oh! No-n-
Okay, it's in spasm.
Oh, no-
Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
Hey!
Hey! Hi Bonnie!
Oh.
What are you guys doing?!
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
All right, Julie.
Bye.
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
Not her.
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
I think so too.
Oh well, lost again. That's it! You and me, outside!
Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
What?!
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
Okay!
Hey.
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
What about the part where he has rabies?
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
And cut!
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
Yeah, I'm all...in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
Because I'm in love with you.
What?!
No!
Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
It can do this.
It-it's great to meet you Paul.
I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing! It's an expression.
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
Hey, big guy, game time.
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
Shut the door! Shut the door!!
What's-what's going on?
Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Uh-huh, I don't know.
Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
Dr. Franzblau, hi.
So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
Do you know where the store is?
No.
A little bit.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you?!
No.
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
You do now. You're having dinner with me.
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
Okay.
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
Oh, hi Rachel.
Hi.
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Dudes.
So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
Absolutely!
Yeah?
They gave me the shaft all right.
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
Hey! You're a good dancer!
Really?
What do you mean?
Like this.
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Oh yes there is!
That was an accident! And so were you.
Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
What?! I've never seen one before!
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
Hello all!
Hi...dad.
So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
Really.
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.
Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
Oh Jack stop.
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
Chandler?
Whadja think?
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
He is so cute!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Im gonna wait till after we order. Its her, right.
Think she got fired at Riffs?
No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... ..bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?
It looks like her.
Um, excuse me.
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
Um-hmm.
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
Yeah.
Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know?
That's the one.
All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
I'm not freaking out.
Then why are you laughing?
What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.
Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
Hi!
Hi.
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
Excuse me, I-I couldn't help overhearing, you're marrying Chandler Bing?
I'm really not deciding!
Fine!
Yeah that's right.
Huh, good luck!
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
I know!
Okay!
Me too! I'm sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
I'm having a really good time!
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
Oh.
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.
They are. Why?
Happy birthday!
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.
Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
Oh my God!
That's Fergie baby!!
So, I hear you're single now...
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
What?!
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
Hello darlings.
And there's daddy!
Yes! I have it right here. Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
Yes, what's the name, please?
Emily Waltham.
Okay.
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Really?
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
Bumpy?
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Alright. What's the message?
Uh... I don't know.
What?
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind. You got one minute.
Okay.
What?
Daddy!
Fine! Two minutes. Go.
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
Yeah.
So- you can tell?
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
Really?
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
What if you put them here.
Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
What, look back?
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
Well, no. But...
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
But you found me!
Kill me. Kill me now.
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
You've done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.
Thank God.
Yeah, she's fired.
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
Not so fast Wesley!
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
What?
We're just friends.
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
So you like the short hair better.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
You OK?
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
I was thinkin' about it.
She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
Monica! Would it?
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
No I don't think so.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Oy.
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
No, can we get back to me?
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.
I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
Honey, we gotta go!
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
The reason he just said.
What do you need?
Yeah?
I wish I could talk to her.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
Yeah, I got that.
You take care Jill.
Okay, see ya!
Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Well, that's really a different question.
I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
Wh..
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Oh, you're not a dingus.
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining-Oh no.
Let's show 'em.
Okay dad.
Bye.
Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
That's where you pick up the bag.
Exactly.
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?
No.
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
Umm.
Ohhhh!! Gross!!
Is she great or what?
So? Huh? What do you think?
What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
I've been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? Where have you been? Vic?!
Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
When is she leaving?
Tonight. What are you doing?
Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
Okay.
Bye.
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
Thanks. You want it?
Huh?
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
The Celtics.
The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
There is no father.
..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Okay, errrr, Monica?
Yes? ..yes, she is.
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
Do you want me to check again?
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Any luck?
Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
Both of us?
Maybe. Does that scare ya?
We'll be there.
Great. I'll ah, see ya then.
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
What time?
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
No! Sam Waterston!
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
Oh, absolutely!
It's a good play, isn't it?
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
Hi. I'm back.
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I'll see you later?
Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
Oh, sly.
Okay!
Bye Ross.
I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.
Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do?
Nooo! Why would you think that?
Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad.
I think we'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross...
He better go on for what I'm paying.
After what he just said, you're paying for the whole bloody lot.
I, Ross...
Take thee, EM-I-LY...
Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life...
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
Yeah?
And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
Water! Water! Water!
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
What?! Why?
Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
What?!
Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
Really?!
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
Not yet.
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Pretty soon I guess.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
You have some life here, sweetie.
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
It doesn't say that in the script.
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
OK, Rachel, I'm ready.
OK.
Um, yeah I guess that's me.
She's here.
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present.
Hey!
Hi!
Oh. Oh.
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
Hi, how are ya?
Why should I help you?!
The reason he just said.
Oh I'm afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
Hello.
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
I can't do that.
Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
There's nobody here!
She's not making me uncomfortable.
Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
Uh, bye Monica.
Bye, momi-moo.
What is that?
Oh my God!
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
Look at this.
These are from Halloween three years ago.
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
Mockolate.
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
Uh, the book?
What do you mean?
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Is there something wrong?
Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
What?
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
Okay, bye.
I'm sorry things didn't work out...
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
It's nice.
Oh. Oh.
It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
How's it gonna be all right?!
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
What?
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
MY SANDWICH?!!!
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
What? What? What? What is it?
Is everything okay?
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
So are you ok?
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
Hey, Ben! Hey!
So umm, any word from Susan?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
What's too much fun?
C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
Hey.
Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
What's this? Blue nail polish?
Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Let me ask you a question.
Hmm.
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
Relieved?
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
Hello, Ross?
Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Really? About what?
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Oh my God, what happened?
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
It's for me.
I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
Huh. Yeah?
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
Great.
All right, thank you so much for all your help.
No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
What are you doing?
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
Oh yeah, of course you don't!
Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
Oh, who's this little guy?!
Oh! Ooh! Umm!
You are so precious, I could just take you home.
Hey, why don't you?
But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
Sure.
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
I'm, I'm still me.
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
Did he call?
No. Sorry.
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
How-how are you, Mom?
What?
What's different?
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Become a drama critic!
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
Oh, classy.
Yep! I sure know how to pick 'em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
It-it's so great to see you both here.
Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
Oh my God!
...of course you can kick his ass son.
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
Yeah, I'd really like that.
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
So, here's somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
Well, this is much better.
He cut off his ear.
And?
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
Oh, good.
Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-
So...
So?
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
Hi.
Erica.
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
Hey!!
There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
Is anyone else starting to really like him?
May I help you?
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.
Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
May I help you?
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
Oh God, yes!
That is funny.
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
Oh that is so great! That's...
As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
Professor Geller?
Yeah?
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
What?
Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
Yeah.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Okay.
Yeah.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
Like an eclipse.
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Ew, this feels very weird.
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
So, what are you saying now?
Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
I am gonna try and quit drinking.
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
That's not all.
Oh sure it is!
Um, what- what would make you think that?
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
Thank you sweetheart.
I don't think so.
Who are you?!
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
No! Nothing!
Yeah! That would be great!
You're into hardcore S&M right?
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
...Quality, right, great.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
What? He's cute!
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
Hey, it's my list.
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
She broke my arm.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
Yeah, big fan.
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Here!
What's this?
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Yeah.
Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
Yes! Hell yes!
All right then, it's settled.
So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
Ohh...
Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
Okay. Okay.
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
Oh yeah.
All right, let's do it!
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
What'cha gonna' do?
Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.
He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
Mr. Heckles.
How did this happen?
That's terrible.
I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.
Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
Look, I. . .
Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
Oh God.
It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
No you answer it and take pledges.
But I'm the host!
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Well, here's your phone doctor.
You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
No.
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
I know.
Well, we should probably get going.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
I don't know, I don't have my jammies.
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
It is starting to get dark out there.
He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
Oh my God!
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
What's the matter?
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.
So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?
Our next cocktail party?
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?
Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
Oh, I....
Oh, I know...
Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
So there is no good time to ask that question.
The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
I don't speak English.
Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
What's ah, what's so funny about that?
Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so...
So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
In...in two weeks.
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
We?
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
Hhhhiiiii.
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
Yeah, I forget which ones.
No thanks.
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
Nope.
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Oh my God!
What do you, what do you think?
Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
What?
Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling.
Really?!
Yeah, really.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
Not great.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Oh my God!
I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
Oh.
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
You're a big scrud.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Just aim for the bump.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
Oh! Ow!
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
I am?
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.
Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
Uh-oh.
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
Okay, that hurt us.
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
No.
Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
That said it was my sandwich?!
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
First of all, it's on your ass.
Well then, what is it?!
I'm with Hamilton!
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Okay, you're fine.
Hey!
Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.
Lovely to meet you.
Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .
Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
That'll be $3.85.
It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
Amy!
I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
It-it's great to meet you Paul.
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
So Ross, what your problem?
Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
She could be you.
Okay, I'm not getting this!
I'm totally getting it!
Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
What one?
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
What?
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
I don't know.
Chandler is such an idiot!
Drink?
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Ah-ha! Too cocky!
Oh yes there is!
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
Yeah.
Would you give me one minute!! Please.
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
Oh! You know what I need?
Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
Hey guy!
Yeah, he's gotta go.
No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
The new girl's good.
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!

There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
A monkey.
Yes have you seen any?
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Of course.
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Chandler!
Oh.
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
What?!
Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
I know.
My job!
...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Whadja think?
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Saw your head. Saw your head.
I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
American Express?
No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so...
That's just halftime, there's more of this.
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!
Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.
I won! That was my quarter!
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
Is that true miss?
Sells drugs to kids.
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
This is it! This is my category.
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
Am I allowed to drink anything?
I'll get it.
No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Wow! Sure! That's great!
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
I can't help you Joey.
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
What's that smell?
I know!
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Who?
I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
Yes!
Am I?!
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Maybe.
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
Where have you been?
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
Take it back?
Absolutely.
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
Hi!
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Well, I-I don't like it.
Really?!
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
I know what your problem is.
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away?
I promise.
Yeah!
Can he handle the stick?
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
So you wanna get some dinner?
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Okay!
All right.
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
And there it is.
Okay. Bye.
Bye.
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
Zoo dollars?
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
Not really.
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Yeah, okay.
I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
Rachel?
Yeah.
No!
Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
Oh?
Ohh.
Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
So, who's the mystery man?
All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
It seemed like such a simple idea.
Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Wow! I would trade.
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
We're uh, we're getting married.
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Look I just thought that...
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Okay. I'll miss you.
Dope!
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
All right.
It's not that weird, is it?
I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
No they didn't!
Hey!
Move in with me.
What?!
Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
Of course, yeah!
Ooh, I like cards.
Are you all finished here?
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
Yeah.
So far, I've sold seventy-five.
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Oh o-, OK man.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
Yeah!
Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing.
I have a question about this scene.
Yes?
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
Hey!
Hey!
No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
Wow! This place is fabulous!
Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
Ow!
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
I guess.
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
Ow!
Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
Okay, I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
Do you?
What?
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
I've got no reason to stay.
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
They're here already? How are they doing this?
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
We kinda broke up this morning.
Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she's the same size as me.
Right. Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Really?
No, I'm good.
So it looks like you've got some great experience here. Let's see ahh, reason for leaving last job?
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?
Hmm-Hmm.
Mmm-Unmm.
Come on. I want to know.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum
We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
Ok, thanks.
Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
What?!
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
Okay uh, however...
Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
But....
I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
Yeah, of course, Donald.
What?!
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
That's the best one! Oh my God, thank you so much!
Well. Hey...
Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I'm sorry!"
Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
Who?
Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
What?
No suds, no save. Ok?
Great! That's great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
Okay.
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
How, how is this my fault?
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Now she sounded breezy.
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
Who's singing?
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
The next, next?
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
They loved me!
Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
That's sweet. Could I take her?
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
Yeah.
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
No! I mean he's nice.
Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Kinda.
Oh-ohh, thank you.
Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
And tell him what?
Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
I have actually not heard of that.
Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less...
None the less.
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
Which guy?
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
Okay! How you doin'?
Very busy.
No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
Chandler! You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being.
Thank you!
I'll talk to them!
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
Whoa, snowing out there?
No.
Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
So you uh, still wondering?
No, we just went out.
So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
Ross isn't here.
Oh. Stop it!
Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
What?
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
What uh-What did you-What?!
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
They're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules.
You are so fired.
What?
Really? Its not just frowned upon?
I love it at Joey's!
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that?
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Hey, where's his thing?
Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
Oh you should, it's great.
This place is really beautiful!
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
Sure!
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
Oh.
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
Hi!
Hi, I'm Joshua.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
Phoebe?
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
God!
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
Oh! What's new in sex?
The only man I've ever been with is your father.
Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
You bet! What's the part?
You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
Wait. I wanna show you something.
What is it?
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know.
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
Right, okay, um-mm.
Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.
Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-Wait! Did you write this?
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.
Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
You brought a carrot.
What?
You brought a carrot?!
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad.
But you're not. Okay, good.
I'm sorry.
It's not?
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Okay.
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
She's not making me uncomfortable.
Do you want me to quit?
What?! What would make you think that?
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Not necessarily...
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Really? Then why are you like that?
Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
No.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
An advance?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
Me too!
Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
Oh, well, I'll show you around.
You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that.
So... We go eat.
Yes.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
She you in the parking lot.
No, Rach!
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."
Marenge,
Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.
Phoebe?
Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
Um, do you wanna sit?
Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Pete, can I get you something else?
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.
Or?
Kidney stones!
They are. Why?
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
How are you ever going to sell this place?
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
You don't secretly smoke do you?
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
Ohh!
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Eh, do you believe that?
Yeah?
How do you do. Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! Did they have representation?
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
No, they-they weren't in the play.
We're not actors.
Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
Doesn't matter.
What?
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Excellent, I'll be there.
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
Rachel?
Yeah. Hi Mark!
Oh, I did!
Yes.
Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
Hi Ralph.
Hi Kim.
And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
Mmm-Hmm.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
Oh, what a fun office.
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
You didn't!
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there's an age difference between us.
Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing.
Well, that was ah...
Better?
I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.
Rachel.
Barry?!
Oh!
We have got to start locking that door!
Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! Who would do a think like that?
Ohh, this cake is really good!
Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
3-B!
Oh yeah, aww!
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
No-no-no-no. Hey!
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
Where have you been?
Long story, honey.
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
Good luck!
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
Dad, dad.
Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I'm your mother.
Heh?
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
Yes we are. So, coffee?
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Thanks.
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Still smoking cigars?
No that's, that's okay.
So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
How 'bout Ben?
I like Ben.
We uh, we just cooked it up.
That's what we were off doing.
I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.
No. Why?
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
It can do this.
And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one and only boyfriend...
Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.
It's nice to have a boyfriend.
Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Ah.
Oh, hi, darling!
Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
You and Ralph?
Kenny the copyboy.
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
Hello, funny Valentine.
Hi, Just Janice.
If you don't do it, I will.
So, um, what do you do for a living?
Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
So ah, Monica ready yet?
She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
What?!
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
Please stop it!
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
Who knows?
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
Yes, please.
Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Was I talking to her about gas?
More so than anything else.
That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!
What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother?!
Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
Oh noo...
Well of course not, but you were very good.
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
No.
That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
OK.
Ready?
Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
Ok.
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
Phoebe's dead.
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Yes I am.
Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
I remember when we first got engaged.
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
Uh-oh.
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
What, look back?
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...
I don't....
Right, okay, um-mm.
Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know.
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
Oh, I embarrass you?
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
They're all tourists.
You know, we're all wondering who this Rachel is. Can you point her out to me?
Sweetheart, sweetheart...
Yes?
Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left.
Oh.. Never mind. Who are you?
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
So, what's this.
Some of your old stuff.
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
What do we got here?
Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Mm! Night Gar'!
So did you read your evaluation yet?
Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
A joke they would appreciate?
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
Are they, uh, firm?
They'r alright.
No really, they're OK.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
We should?
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
You probably want us to move in together?
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
Ross's what?
You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
Hi!
Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so...
None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
Okay.
...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
...and you sand it and you varnish it...
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
...the scotch and the cigarettes...
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
I'm sorry guys, closed set.
Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Will you-will you please?
Oh.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
What?
You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
She's not much of a phone person.
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Maybe you should.
I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
The pizza-place across the street any good?
What?!
Okay. Okay.
Stop saying that. I hate that.
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
He's sleeping.
Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
It's not that kind of anniversary.
All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
Well, thanks for the books.
No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan...
Hello?
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
We've come for her things.
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's oh it's-ew used. Umm, cool.
Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Yes, yes I was.
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Tho?
Ohhh.
He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'
All right, rock on.

Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here.
Your eyes are very pretty.
The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.
And I do have one seat left.
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Huh.. How about 600?
Sorry.
Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
Sorry.
Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Oh, good. Thisll be fun.
Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
Excuse me, there was no time!
Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
Does anybody need more coffee?
Yeah, I'll take some.
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
Honey, it isn't good luck.
It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
What's goin' on?
You're it! Now run and hide!
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
Awww!
It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
Wow.
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
That's my monkey.
You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
Alright, I want my monkey.
No!
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so...
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda...
Oh, me too.
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Well yeah.
You really ok with it?
Oh honey, I'm fine.
Next on the platforms are... ...you two! And... ...You two!
Okay.
Okay, everybody hold!
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
Monica! Would it?
Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
What are you doing?
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
It's gonna be so great.
Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay.
What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything...
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
All right!
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Eh, worth a shot. Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
No!
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Yeah.
Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Get out, get out of my apartment.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Ugh!
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
Okay, great.
So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
No, nothing.
Oh really?
Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to...
Oh, I think I see the problem. And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love.
Oh God!
Ow!!
Oops.
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
And?
Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
Who is it?
Edward Nevski?
No.
Ahh.
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
Of course.
This is unbelievable.
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
Hi!
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
Well you should be embarrassed.
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.
You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
It's up to you.
Oh, hi! How are you doing?
Oh.
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
-leg?
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
Can I get you something from the bar?
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
So the light went out in my refrigerator...
Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.
What?
Dad?
Just mine?
I'm afraid so.
He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
H-h-h-how's the duck?
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
No, that's all right.
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.
Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
Come on man, you're not a potato.
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
Yeah!
Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
...And then he burst into flames.
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
Well, we got into a fight 'cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.
Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
Your getting married?!
Oh, yeah!
Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube.
Hey.
Hi. Mom. Dad.
Judy, the kids..
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.
Yep.
Together.
Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
Hopefully.
Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
OK, I'll see you later babe.
See ya.
Bye! See you later!
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
Hi.
Hi...May I help you?
Okay...who are you?
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
One ticket to Yemen?
So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so...
Cheers!
Cheers!
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
No, I'm Mary-Theresa.
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
You want me to see a therapist?
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
What was all that about?
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
So what's your name?
Chandler.
Oh, they're a hoot.
And who is your friend?
Sorry old boy, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
Okay, okay.
What was all that about?
It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
My parents are dead.
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
Alright.
Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.
Ok, you really want me out?
Yes please.
I want you out.
No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
Yeah-eah-ha!
Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
Went out with Joey.
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
Wow! I did not see that coming.
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
What does that mean?
Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so...
When, when did-how, how did you...
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys...
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
Yes, I realize that...
Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
Everything.
Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
Worth a shot, huh?
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
Oh.
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
C'mon hurry, hurry.
Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
I'm...happy...for you?
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
What, what are you laughing at?
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
Bye!
Bye Janine!
Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
Oh.
I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
What?
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Ohh that's nice.
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Well kinda old, like 30.
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Same difference.
I get it! Well, that's that.
No, you know what, I think you should go.
Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?
Who?
It's not what you think, that was...
You told me I was the only one.
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
Well it's not Sean Penn.
Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you?
No, she touched mine first!
That's my job!
Ewww!!!
You can't have sex with her!
No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Ohh, that's a good one.
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
Where's Kate?
No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
What?
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
I'm sorry.
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
Hey, ready for dinner?
Ooh, absolutely!
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
How about Mama Lisettie's?
Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
Who?
Hombre?
What's he doin' in my section?
Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
Oh yeah, there you go.
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
No, we just went out.
You're smart. I like that.
Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
Here, I'll get it.
Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Oh, great!
You're not dying Hope, you're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.
Hope! Hope!
Drake!
Oh Drake.
Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
Hey.
How are you?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
That I was not expecting.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
It's my sister.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
It's not here.
Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. Would you come over here please?
No-no.
No, we'd just like to close them.
Hi, I'm Karen.
I wanna quit the bank!
Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
So it's-it's not heeled yet?
No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
What is it, Tim?
It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there.
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
In the moment, yeah.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
No.
Me neither.
Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Bobby.
Yeah, OK.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
No. Have you seen David?
No, no, he hasn't been around.
Minsk?
Minsk. It's in Russia.
Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Where's Ben?
He's sleeping.
But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I'm afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
But he has to know how I feel!
Well I-I think your wrong.
Oh-no.
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
No sir.
There you go.
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
Yeah, in a poem maybe.
No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
So um, who was she?
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Well, you seem fine.
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
I'm here!
Hey!
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
No, don't worry about it.
No, you could've lost your job.
Thank you! You're great!
Y'know what?
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
I'd rather not.
Oh, yeah, why not?
Oh, is everything in the car?
Yes. Did you settle the bill?
Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
You have three new messages.
Not any more!
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
Girls, sit down.
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Alright.
Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
Hi.
Would you like some pancakes?
...Come on! Why are we here?!
Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
Nice!
Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer...
Gary.
A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Thanks.
So were you guys together a long time?
Now that she broke up with you?
Yeah.
I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
No sir.
Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
Pretty much.
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
Oh hello, Ross.
Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
Ooh, and I can do this.
We can't do that.
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Hi, nice to meet you!
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
Rachel?
Yeah.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
You would think.
So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
Jason?
Yeah, come on in.
Nah-ha!
You must be Ross.
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Why?
Bastard!
Hey!
Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
Well, start looking.
Wow.
Right! You're right!
Heh... y'know?
I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
Thats unbelievable.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? You want a piece of me?
What-what's going on?!
Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!
Okay, okay.
But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
All right.
Thank you, thank you.
Who's your roommate?
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Oh! Okay! You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
Oh, nobody's judging you.
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say...
You two will have very hairy children.
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
Well, you kids take the train in?
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
Monana was very brave.
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
Your son.
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.
Okay, umm, you're a loon.
I don't know.
Why not?
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Oh no!
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
Yeah! Okay.
That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like...
Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
I-I'll call ya.
Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing.
Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing.
I see the head.
Yes, it has a head!
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
A lover?
A surfer.
I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
Tell us!
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
Yeah, could you scooch?
Yeah, move over just a little bit.
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Fair enough.
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.
Definitely.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
What do you know?!
Oh-oh, Phoebe!
Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating.
Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
Oh really, you guys tryin' again?
Yeah.
'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch...
Oh I know!!
You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!
Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.
Oh, hi.
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
So, uh, how was he?
Eh.
Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
Oh.
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.
Well I. . .
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
Here we go.
Uh-huh.
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
...the scotch and the cigarettes...
...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?!
Melissa!
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
Ross.
Yeah.
I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
We've got a problem.
Tell me.
Is it bad?
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
Yeah, I didn't know that.
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Who jumps at loud noises!
Wow! I could've died tonight.
Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
Well, I don't know. Are you a masseur?
Yes I am.
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Forget it, that's off.
Why?!
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
No, I was working on my pottery.
Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot.
Ooh, erotiery!
Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know...
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Hey, Chandler.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
I know. That's what I told her.
I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.
Oh my God.
What?
OK, well, bye.
Goodbye.
OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
Rachel? Um, hi.
Hi.
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
Neither am I.
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
You can say that again Mac.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
So, what did you guys think?
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
Well, that' me. Here, have this. I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
Me too.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Oh. Thank you.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Are you being British?!
No. Not anymore.
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
And Action!
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
Okay.
All right, from the top.
Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
Oh?
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Okay.
Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
I'm sorry sweetie, it's the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
Ohh! Didn't know! Okay!
Okay! Ohhh no!
I can't promise anything.
We're really gonna do this, huh?
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
What?!
Yeah.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
Are you sure?
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
17 years ago.
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Well that's not a third nipple.
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?
I think you may have a drinking problem.
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Oh... shoot.
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?
Woah.
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
The one in the director's chair.
Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
Hi!
Hi!
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Oh hi Phoebe.
Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
I don't know, they're just a little blah!
Blah?!
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Easy.
No problem.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
The nerve huh?
Yeah!
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
What?
What?
We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It's looks like a curling iron.
Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
I don't use a curling iron.
Well someone does.
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
That would be no.
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
I am Julio.
Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
No one likes a buttmunch.
And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!.
I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
I was her accountant four years ago.
Ohhhh!
That's great!
So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
Wow!
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
Hello.
You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
Ross? What's with the neck?
He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
Well, you would know.
Oh, come on!
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Oh, I thought I heard you.
Hi!
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
So.
So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
Really? Me?
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
Are you travelling with a child?
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
American Express?
No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
Why?!
Because I-I like you.
Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
Uh, we are here to break up with you.
Both of you?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
Yeah!
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
The Luisa from home room!
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
Good morning.
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
What?! No! Why?!
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
I didn't know you could get married here.
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that.
Really?
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?
Tribbiani.
Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
She's not much of a phone person.
Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
I-I like pizza!
You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Oh, this is so cute.
Oh, I got that for him.
Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing.
Oh my God!
Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing.
Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
I see the head.
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
Lebanon.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
I thought it went very well.
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
He went out for groceries.
Ok so will he be back soon?
Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
A date.
Yeah, I'm her date.
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
So, um, have you told your parents?
Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.
I love you Phoebe.
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
Mitzi is.....
Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
What?
Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
I, umm, shut up!
"Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
Noooo!!
All right, hang on!
Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...
Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know.
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
I don't....
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
I'm not listening to you!
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
No, let's just leave the lights on.
Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.
Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Curry.
Mmmm!
...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Your mom was arrested?
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Shhh.
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
Really?!
No-o-o!!
Oh! Oh!
Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
Call me.
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
Hi.
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
You-you have to meet me in the middle here.
Dad!!
What-what's going on?!
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
All right, there you go!
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
What?
I-I-I...
Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
Ok, have a good break-up.
Hey, Janice.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Okay.
Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother.
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
Oh good.
Oh Drake.
Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
Really?
Will you call him?
Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie...
Yeah.
My whole family's from Naples!
Joey, this is awkward part.
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....
Okay.
Okay.
Wow! This girl is good.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
I know.
Hey Gunther.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Do you still work here?
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
Mmm-mmm.
Wow.
Aren't you going to swallow that?
Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
Susan, go deep.
This is impossible. Its just impossible.
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
So uh, who's your photographer?
Jeffery.
The best man? Wow!
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken?
What? Do you think he likes me?
No, Joey.
No. No food with a face.
You have not changed!
My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart!
Okay.
Okay.
So, are we going in there?
I am!!
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
That said it was my sandwich?!
What?
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Well, go ahead Rachel.
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
What a sweet story.
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now Im here.
No, no... how come you are working here?
Can we start over?
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Oh, that's better then.
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?
Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out...
So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Oh that's okay.
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
Oh that's great! You are the best!
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
Ow!
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
That's fine, thank you.
Next.
Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Chandler.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
No, I'm still married.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
What? What? What?
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
It's my sister.
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Without me?!
Yeah.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Um-hmm, five actually.
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
Oh my God. I think you're right.
Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
What happened to the library?
There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
I never stop thinking about it.
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
Why not?
I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
Mmm.
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
I'll help you dial.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
Are we ready to order?
Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
Wow, look at these prices.
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
Okay well that's good to know.
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
Sure, I love this part!
Come on in.
Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
And?
So what does this mean?
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
You, you want, you want me to move out?
Uh-huh.
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
Ross.
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
I'm Megan Bailey.
Have you found your dress yet?
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Oh, thanks for the tip.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Burning's good.
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me.
You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
Okay. Okay.
Ohh...
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.
The only man I've ever been with is your father.
I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
No.
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
And cut!
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Yeah we are!
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
Yeah, they're fine.
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
What?!
Flexible hours.
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
Here you go.

Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Hiya!
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.

Five dollars a box.
And what is second prize?
Well, that makes sense.
Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
Wow, you have really pretty feet.
These old things.
You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
Yeah.
Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
Really? From who?
Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Yeah. Here you go.
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
Hi!
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.

Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Yeah, you're right.
We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
You slept with another woman?
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
Is that all?
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
It's actually going to be just family.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!
Getting so good at that!
It was Max's stuff.
You remember Janice.
Vividly.
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
What are you guys doing here?
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad.
I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.
Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
You really thought it was perfect?
Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
I got it.
I got it.
Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
Yeah, look how that worked out.
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
How can I help you?
You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
Ross's what?
Phoebe?
Yes? Yes! Oh.
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
Ross, take me off speakerphone.
Hi.
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
You obviously can't keep away from her.
Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's.
Are you sure this time?
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
There is no alley behind Macy's.
So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study. Uh, sir?
Your name, please?
Joey Tribbiani.
Yes he did.
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or...
Oh. Uhh...
No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.
...Now? Now?
Oh yeah, right now.
Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
Something like that?
Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Oh, what? What was it?
The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Good morning.
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.
Wow!!
Oh dear God, let me think.
Hey.
...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
Hey hey hey! She's on!
Ah! Nora Bing!
Your mom was arrested?
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much.
Rachel!
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
You told me you didn't see anything.
I tell ya a lot things!
Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face and her chest I could really put something together.
No, they-they weren't in the play.
We're not actors.
Could I borrow it?
Hi! Remember me?
I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there.
Hey. I was...
Hey!
Whoa! Hey-hey! What's going on here? Who is this guy?
I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Hey.
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
What?
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing...
Both of you together?
Wh-what's up?
...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
Oh just say it Kyle!
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
Okay, keep saying it!
Am I too late?!
We have our babies?
Yeah.
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
No, I'm sorry.
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Huh.
This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
Gotcha.
Hi Daddy!
You remember Ross.
Um-hmm.
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
What did I tell you about the hall?!
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
Great.
Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on!!
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
All right! You go get him! Let's go!
Uh-oh.
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
Great! Okay, good for you!
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
Hi!
Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it.
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
I know that.
Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
What?
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
Yeah, o-okay.
So...
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
Hey.
Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
Because I-I like you.
You like me?
Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
But...
Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
Nice to meet you Monica. Bing!
No, sir.
Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
Okay.
Okay!
Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
We're outta here!
Why?!
You have the power to do that?
This does.
I've been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? Where have you been? Vic?!
She got a job in L.A.
What?!
Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
...so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera!
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Oh yeah!
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
When did that happen to you?!
This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!
Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
Hi, Pheebs.
Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
C'mon, tell us.
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
Thanks.
And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
Oh, that's funny!
I want a baby.
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
No, I'm picking you up.
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
OK, I'll see you later babe.
Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?
You're Erwin's daughter?!
No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank.
Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.
No.
You'll see.
You don't say!
Good luck, babe.
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
Where's Buddy?
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Stop callin'!!
All right!
What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything...
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.
What, what's what you mean?
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
Ah, just one other thing.
Yes?!
Do you want my pickle?
Hey guys.
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
Mmm.
Mm-Hmm.
After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
Well, we had a table in college.
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Ok, just one more point.
Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
Oh, I knew you'd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?
Wow!
My little brother's getting married!!
Do I?
Do you?
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts us.
Take thee Ross...
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
I Ross...
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
Hey!
No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's-that's what you're worried about? If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
Huh?
Oh?
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
Count faster.
Who the hell is Jordie?
Your son.
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
That's it. That's my whole name.
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
Well you said you couldn't go out so....
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Richard? We're ready for you. Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he's playing Vincent.
Hey Joey! We're ready.
Yeah! Me too.
I'm doing my scenes with you?
Nice to meet you Joey.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Take thee, EM-I-LY...
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
Looks like that might come any minute.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
Yeah he was wasn't he.
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
We're ok.
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
Hiya.
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
Ohh.
All right. Mmm-mmm.
Yeah?
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
Well...
No. I...
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?
You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
I wanna quit the gym.
Me? No.
Sorry, members only.
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Isn't that mine?
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Yes, they can stay with us.
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Hey!
No. No, thank you!
Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Oh my God!! Great!
Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. It's a joke.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
Bye.
Right, I've got to be off, I'll see ya. Buh-bye then.
What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
Wow, love your new nose!
Jack.
I'll get it.
No, God! Please, let me!
Fortunately, I won't. And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.
Oh-no.
Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!
Do something..... Something....
Hey.
Look, I dont see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
I am supposed to be the mommy?
Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
I see. So what do you propose to do?
I will flip you for it.
You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
You work and you work and you work on a boat...
He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
Thank you. Uh...
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
I don't want you taking that thing.
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
Hey. What are we drinkin' over here.
Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
What 'cha doing?
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
You-you have a very beautiful... eye.
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
Oh, I totally agree.
No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
I didn't realize that she was so close.
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
Are we still on that?
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
Can you believe this place?
I know, this is a great apartment.
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Why would he turn off the TV?
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
Hey, what happened to you?
Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Nevermind!
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
Jen.
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
Ginger.
I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay.
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so...
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
I have nothing to do with casting.
So what're you guys gonna eat?
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
I want you right here, right now.
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
Take thee Ross...
Take thee Ross...
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts us.
Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
I wasn't invited.
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
Why?!
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
Just call me Paul.
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Well, we were very young when we had her.
But your chin here. Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
Sit down.
Okay.
What?!
A small puff of air, now come on!
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
Hey!
Hey!
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
No one was around to hear that?
So what'd he say?
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Do you want a date Saturday?
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
You want me to wear your panties?
Could ya?
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
Ohh, tough call.
Yeah.
So how do you kids like your coffee?
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
No that's, that's okay.
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Oh really?
Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!
Oh, so did I.
No tongue.
HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
Yes, I am.
Is it--?
Congratulations.
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
What's wrong?
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
What?
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift.
Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
I can hop.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
Pretty nice?
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
You gotta take the canoe!
Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
Uh, may I help you?
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Nobody sees the king!
Oh umm, uh we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
That'd be great, thanks.
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
Nooo!
I know!
Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Okay ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
No! You're the sweetest!
It's a great class.
Thanks.
You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
May I help you?
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
What does she mean?
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
Booo!!
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
What a wank!
So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
We really do feel bad about this though.
We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
Huh?
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
Well yeah!!
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
Nooo!!
...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
That's weird.
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
She's supposed to be with you.
You're good.
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
Ohh whoops.
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
You can say that again Mac.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now.
Wow! You are really good at this.
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Hey!
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
Hi Rachel!
Hey!
So were done then!
Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Hey! Sugar-O's!
Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
For Chandler!
Okay. I'm in.
Does it have to be a whole day?
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
No, just a salad will be fine.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Tell me about it!
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
Yeah, they're not so bad.
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
I don't get it.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Eight months.
That's a really long time.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
But it's $2,000.
Sorry.
No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
Okay. Sometimes I feel...
Huh?
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
What?!
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
Oh, yeah. What's this?
Um, not even a little bit.
It's about you.
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
Really? Well, in that case...
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
Ohh! That's great!
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
I had a really nice time tonight.
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Oh, I thought I heard you.
Oh, I think I see the problem. And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love.
We appear to have angered it.
We?! We angered it?!
Oh God!
Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to...
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
Hi!
Like it would help.
You are so bad!
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
What?!
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
It's not a library...
I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.
Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
Wow, that's great.
Oh, yeah!
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
Say what?
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Oh that was a real person?!
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early...
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to...
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Because we can remember them.
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
All right, you two, stop it!
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
Ah, that's OK, come on in. Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.
It's James Bond.
Sorry we're late.
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.
Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
So you ah, ready for our last practice?
Look, you wanna use our place?
No, I ahh, had another idea.
Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now Im here.
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
No, no... how come you are working here?
Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
I'm all done.
Thank God.
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
It's not funny, this is actually my job.
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Ah, just one other thing.
I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
Professor Geller?
Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
And why exactly would I do that?
Because I'm in love with you.
Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
What? Is it my breath?
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
Yeah. Well, umm.....
Rach, are you okay?
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
The head tilt?
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?
Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
I know I couldn't. So....
Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
Dr. Burke will see you know.
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Ready?
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.
This is for the fourth grade.
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
What, what's what you mean?
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Oh. Oh!
So where are we going next?
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants.
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Hi Ralph.
Well...I Only Have One Thing To Do Today. I guess I could push it back.
Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
Really?! What's your name?
Umm, Frank Buffay.
You're Frank Buffay?
Shh! No! Joe Hill!
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
Wow! What an unusual cat!
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
What?!
Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Mon-Monica?
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Huh.
More wine, dear?
Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria!
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank.
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
Oh.
Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
What?
He's got a girlfriend!
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
I know. I am, I am so sorry.
Again, very sorry.
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
Hey, mate.
How are ya man?
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
That sounds like Nana.
...I can imagine.
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!
Hey!
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Mine? Right here?
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
You mean like exclusive friends?
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?
We were playing rugby.
Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
What's ah, what's so funny about that?
Y'know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
That's weird, she locked the door.
Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
Yeah!
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
I look more like him than you do!
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
Oh, no I don't.
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Oh yes, there you are.
There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
What?
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
The one with "Heston" on it.
Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
Mr. Tribbiani.
Oh hi!
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
I think it was valued at 19,000
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?
Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
Hmm, bummer.
No. But thanks.
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions...
Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
Oh, well, I'll show you around.
Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
Ahh!
Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
The Waltham Residence.
Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
You didn't get the money, did you?
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
Insane!
...from the syphilis.
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
You're all invited to bite me!
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Actually, no, we're not.
Yeah, we are.
She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
So uh, where's Monica?
Hi, Chandler.
Oh my God!
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
For real?
No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
Yeah, they're fine.
Yeah?
Sure. Why not?
Really?
Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
Whenever you're ready.
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Oh my God!!
Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
Joey...
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Oh!
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.
That was great, the kids loved you.
Yay, I rock.
But.
How did you know there was a but?
Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Uh, ow.
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
Isn't there?
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
It's okay...
Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
3-B!
Oh yeah, aww!
Yeah, leave!
Yeah, get out! Now!
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
Oh, say no more!
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
Yep, sucks!
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
...I can imagine.
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Tell her what?
At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo.
Nice to meet ya.
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
Wow.
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
Three, Two, One!
Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
All right! You go get him! Let's go!
Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
You're into hardcore S&M right?
Well, I-I guess-I...
Yeah, great, you betcha!
I almost forget the tickets, didn't I?
Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!
Cut!
No! Year! Happy No Year!
Hey! Look who I found!
Oh, hey guys!
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
Sorry I'm late, what's up?
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Yeah.
Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
That's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
A woman in a man's body.
Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
No, no, I don't want to forget it.
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
Sorry, Pheebs.
Yeah. You okay?
Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
Hi.
Ah here, we brought wine.
Oh, that's great. Look at that.
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
Rachel! You okay?
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
I'm having surgery!
What?!
No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
I like that.
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand.
Ew, this feels very weird.
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Oops.
Okay.
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
No, you started it.
You did!
But...
Now go!
None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so...
Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
Okay.
Oh, who's this little guy?!
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Let it go, Ross.
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
Hi!
Hey.
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
Oh my God, what happened?
I can't believe this.
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
Oh, yeah!
Keep talkin'.
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
Like a hound?
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
Ohh! That's great!
Really?!
No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
What's up?
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Hi.
Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
Thank you. Uh...
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
Well, what was supposed to happen?
Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
No-no-no-no-no we came together!
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Really, y'think so? I don't..
No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
Forget it.
So it's-it's not heeled yet?
Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
What is it, Tim?
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
No.
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Uhh....
Nah.
Phoebe?
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
So, I hear, you hate me!
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together.
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Wow! Really?!
Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Fired! Why?
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
No.
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
She's still with you?
Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face.
God!
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
All I say is, she better get the job.
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
Gay? Yeah.
Hey! Terry.
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
I can't help you Joey.
Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
You're an excellent patient!
So how does it look?
Like a pirate?!
If that helps you.
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
I gotta friend named Mark.
That'll work too.
Yeah, that'd be ok.
Alright.
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
Which do I like?
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Yes!!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Sure. So how long you been...
Since then?!
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
I love you Phoebe.
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times!
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
Uhh do it?
Well, where was I?
Hi!
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
It's not random, it's Bob.
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. Are you all right sweethart?
Oww!!
Game!
I'm not all right.
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.
Really?
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
But you're not.
I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
No it's... Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
They gave me the shaft all right.
Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
Cool! I-I'll see you then.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
Oh good.
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was...
You are so adorable.
You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
She seems fine now.
...emblem of the land I love. The home of....

Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
You're one to talk.
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
Ow! Ross!!
Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
Please, I'm not going for anything.
Well, if you don't, I will.
Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
So?
No!
Thank you sweetheart.
I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
Um, I'm not.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
Really?
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
Oh, we killed them all.
Oh!
Please tell me you're stopping now.
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?
Oh, I know...
Isn't this great?!
Don't spoil it.
Yep! I sure know how to pick 'em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Oh, classy.
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Really. What?
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
Rachel?
Yeah.
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
I would love it if I weren't here!
Me?!
Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.
Susan, go deep.
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
Dude!
Sorry!
Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
Buddy, my monkey?
Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice.
It's good to see you too.
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
Yeah.
I missed this.
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
I know I am.
Who's doing shots?
Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so...
Are you all right?
Oh come on! That's-that's... true.
Hi!
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
I found the picture!
Picture? What picture?
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Oh, thanks.
Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
Yes.
One, two, three...
Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.
And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one and only boyfriend...
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
So it looks like you've got some great experience here. Let's see ahh, reason for leaving last job?
Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she's the same size as me.
No, I'm good.
Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
Okay, we'll give a call if anything comes up.
Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
Woah, dude, burn.
I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
Always illegal Joe.
Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight.
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
Yeah, I know, I.
I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
So how long have you known?
Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Okay...
Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
Hey!
Hey!
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
What? What's what you were afraid of?
What?
I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi!
Hi!
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Yeah.
We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .
Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.
Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
Sir?
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Oh God.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
You okay?
Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I'm family, I'm it. Now, now I'm done.
No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here?
No.
But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
When?
I don't know exactly.
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Done?
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
Uh, okay.
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Kinda.
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
Whattaya mean?
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Hello New York!
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
Hi Chandler.
Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
It was a really beautiful service.
What?
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
Ok.
Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
Ah, oh, hang on a second. Come in, come in. All right, so think about it, and call me back.
Well, yes, it's kind've an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.
Knock, knock, knock.
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
Ahh, yes.
She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
She sent the chicken back again?!
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Thank you. Thank you.
Still rolling, annnnd action!
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
I guess.
Thank you.
And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
But-but, Liam's on my team.
I don't care! You just get him!
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car.
Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
You make up songs?
I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm...
Well, I am.
Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less...
Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
Yeah, but not just that.
None the less.
None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
What just happened?
That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
No.
Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
What?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's-that's what you're worried about? If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What's the thing?
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Huh?
No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
Maybe.
OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
Wow! This place is fabulous!
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
Yeah, I'm sorry man.
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Oh.
Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.
So tell me about this girl?
...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
Ehh, pardon me?
You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I'm afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
Lucky bastard! Janice.
I'm fine.
Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I'm blind!
I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
I would love it if I weren't here!
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
Y-, y-, you like that show?
You don't like that show?
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
There's a Mr. Bing!
Ohh!
I get that a lot.
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
Well, I could cut it.
Really?! You do that?
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
You have really great hair.
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Eh.
Eh?
Well, that makes me feel so good.
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
Is that all?
Ohh, how is he?
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
Hey pal.
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
No. I...
Call her! Call her now!
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
Awww!
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
No.
What?!
Uh, hang out?! How long?
I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
He is?
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Or not, whatever.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Okay. Will you marry me?
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.
Yeah.
Alright, well tell me one of yours.
What if they get mixed up?
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
What?
I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
Uh-huh, yeah.
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Nighty-nite.
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
Hi, were the Rostins. Err, Im J.C., and hes Michael, and were having a boy, and a girl.
Ross, thats my jacket.
I know.
Good for you. Alrighty, next?
Hi, um, Im err, Im Ross Geller, and err ah... ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com... ..whos next?
Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
What?
He thought you said gonad.
Oh, Larry.
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
Oh that's me, I gotta go.
Oh uh, o, OK.
Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
You comin'?
Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
Sure.
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
We really do feel bad about this though.
What about when I started dating Chandler?
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
You have really great hair.
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
What-what 'cha doin'?
Checking to see if it's even.
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
Uh, sure, why not.
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
What's you point man?
Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
Are you yelling at me?!
God no!
Really?!
Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Yes.
Hey, what's up?
You and me, next dance?
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
Now, wh-what, what is that like?
Yeah, yeah.
Why can't I find that?
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Not necessarily...
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles...
I mean, there's a statue in Minsk...
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Umm, anyway...Do you want to have dinner tonight?
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
You are just the sweetest.
No! You're the sweetest!
Okay ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.
I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
What?!
Get out of here, really?!
Absolutely!
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
So, does that mean the audition is off?
What?!
Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
Ohh, I thought that you....
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
Sorry, what?
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
Y'know it's ironic...
What?
We're just gonna be friends.
Y'know what?
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
Hey, the man's dog just died.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Uh, plate?
Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.
Um, do you wanna sit?
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
You're saying, my wife is in you?
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
No, can we get back to me?
Alright. Cab driver number two?
You're welcome.
I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
Okay, bye.
No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here?
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
Ok.
Mmmm hmmm.
That's too much. Sorry.
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing.
What is that?
Oh my God!
Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing.
Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
Bye bye Joey.
Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!
Do you?
Yeah, I do, yeah.
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Oh, what a fun office.
It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
She's your partner.
Hi. I'm Monica.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
Okay...
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
The abridgment.
Oh, okay. The what?
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
Twenty percent.
Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
Really?!
You haven't?
You have?
Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
Is there a Julio here?
I am Julio.
Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
No one likes a buttmunch.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
I had a bra.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
What?!
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!
Uhh, you said there was a party.
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
No, I will not cave.
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
That's OK.
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Hey!
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
It's okay. Come, come on in.
Oh.
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
Wow! That would be great.
Really?
Good morning.
Hi!
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
'Scuse me.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
Not to me.
Yeah, fair enough.
Bye Dan!
Uh, bye Monica.
That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
Well of course I am!
You know you've been spitting on me?!
Wow! Didn't know that.
Great!
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
What?! Anything! Anything!
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
Hey! How's it goin'?
Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Anybody lose this?
Hmm.
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
Well kinda old, like 30.
Oh.
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
A little.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Just a little bit of sugar.
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Oh, you get used to it.
Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh my God.
What is with your nose?
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
Happy to.
Yay!
You may kiss the bride.
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
What did you do when they found out?
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
We both do that!
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Would you excuse me for a second?
So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
How are ya man?
Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Oh my God. I think you're right.
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
If you don't do it, I will.
So, um, what do you do for a living?
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Hi Kim.
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
It seemed like such a simple idea.
Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like...
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
Yeah! Okay.
Hey! Hey!
Who is it?
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Isn't this great?
Hmm.
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Wow.
What?
Me.
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.
You have some life here, sweetie.
I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
For...me.
Well, not just for you.
Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Hey!
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Ohh, fun!
Ohh, great!
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
Okay.
No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... ..bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?
This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.
Think she got fired at Riffs?
Im gonna wait till after we order. Its her, right.
It looks like her.
Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.
Mon-Monica?
Yes?
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.
Thank you, sir.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
Yes, tell me.
I know. I am, I am so sorry.
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...
That was you?
Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
No! No dessert, just a check, please.
Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
I've got no reason to stay.
I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Oh, will you give me the thing.
Hi, Max!
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
No ma'am.
What the hell happened?!
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
Yes, I will tell her.
So you didn't leave the bank?
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
Ok, that's Eric.
Glad to be of help. Matches.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
What a nice story!
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Yeah, take your time.
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
Ohh-ha-ha!
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Really?!
Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Oh.
So, all right.
Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Awww!
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
...And then he burst into flames.
Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
No.
Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
I'd love some juice. Thanks.
Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating.
Oh really, you guys tryin' again?
Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Ohh, impressive.
Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
Any luck?
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
You put these on my desk!
I did not!
I'm not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?
Monica! Where are you from?
New York.
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
Okay then!
Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
Oh yeah, no problem.
Thanks.
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?
No, this is a loaner.
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Yeah, they're not so bad.
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
We've got a box.
I was probably waiting for it to open.
I gotta tell you, you look great now.
Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
Alrighty. From the top.
OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?
No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
Hi, how ya doing?
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!
Not so fast Wesley!
Remoray!
Oh! Thank God!
Hope! Hope!
Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
Yes, I realize that...
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
Who's Chip?
Shhh!
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
And then... your face is bloated?
No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Yeah.
So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
Hey!
Hey.
No, I can spot you from here.
What?
Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
No!
Okay.
So umm, are we cool?
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
So... they sss-still seem normal.
That's because they are.
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Of course it was a line!
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
You had sex, didn't you?
How do you do that?
You know Paul?
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
Yes.
Great!
What?!
For all the free food you gave away.
Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
How are you doing?
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
Hey!
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
I've never seen it!
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
Yeah it is. . . what?
Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Who's they?
Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
Well, uh, I ate some.
Hello?
Hi.
Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
Like-like what?
Wow!
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
Really.
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
You still can't stand her can you?
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?
Some guys are just lucky I guess.
Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
No, no, they only said you.
Oh, ok. Alright.
Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. You Miss Geller?
Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
Oh.
Okay.
Sign here.
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
Well, whatever works for ya...
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Yeah.
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!
You can't give up on your dream.
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
Emily!
I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
I know!
Op.
Eh.
All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
You're so welcome.
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Eh, do you believe that?
Yeah?
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Ooh, sorry little Mr. Chic-A-Dee, sorry you went doody in my hand! Well, I guess we're not going out anymore. Whaa!!!
Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
Step away from the duck.
Joey!
Hey!
Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
Hey guy!
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
Yeah! Right!
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Who knows?
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
Ok, yeah.
Alright. So um, stilts huh?
Ok.
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
Do you have a sec?
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Sir.
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.
Bye.
Bye.
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.
I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
What's a koondis?
I guess it's worth a try.
Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
About what?
Y'know, about what happened with us.
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
Nu-uh!
Oh, an old glove?
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
I-I do though.
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Behind you?
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
Ooh, okay... good.
What is this place?
I think we have an answer.
Whats she doing here?
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
See.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
You are so smitten.
I am not.
No it's... Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
Yeah?
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
Really? Well, in that case...
Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies have been.
Show me the badge again.
Shiny.
You are just nonstop!
We're outta here!
Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Thank goodness.
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
Oh well, no I...
Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
Huh!
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
You're not a senior?
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
Oh well, okay, good luck.
Yeah.
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
What?! Why?!
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
Nice to meet ya.
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Did not.
How was that possible?
Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
I think it's great you guys are doing this.
Well, we are great guys.
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
Yes, it has a head!
All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
All right. Here's your first baby.
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
Thank you.
Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
Yeah.
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
Wow! I did not see that coming.
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife...
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
I love you, Pete!!!
Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
Oh no!
Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know.
Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad.
You really thought it was perfect?
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...
I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
Ross, I'm gonna go.
Go? Why?
But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Good bye Ross.
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
Oh!
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
I don't think so.
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
Oh, come on!
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
That won't be necessary.
Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
You can watch our tape if you want.
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
Great. That would be fine.
For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
God, what a mess.
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Wow!
No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
Where do I know you from?
Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
That could be it.
Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
Oh, I love you too. But...
And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
Yes, I realize that...
I love working with designers!
With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
What?
Oh yeah, like you never called!
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Why don't we do a trial run.
I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
You do now. You're having dinner with me.
Shut up.
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
Wow! What a pleasure.
Excuse me. Hi.
Yes?
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
My parents will be so happy.
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
No!!
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out...
Whatever! What about you Meg?
What?!
She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
You're our third call tonight.
Really?
I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
Hey Phoebe.
Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future &#150;and-and-and we were getting married or something.
Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
What?
Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Yeah?
Are you a virgin?
Really?
Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
Well, people!
People, people, people.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Now get on out of here, you!
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Oh, I can't watch this.
Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
Your parents'?
Yeah, they're out of town.
No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
You think about it.
Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Ohh, it's time to go.
Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm...
Oh. Uh, what?
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Uh-huh.
Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Oh.
You want me to cancel it?
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
Chandler Bing?
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Hey Ross!
Hey!
Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
Home is Home Star stew.
Hmm, bummer.
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
Oh, boy, do they suck.
Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa.
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
The Celtics.
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
I'm moving in.
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Boyfriend?
No.
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Ooooh.
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
Not all bad.
Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
I beg your pardon?
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
Of course.
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
Oh my god.
It's ok. I'm sorry.
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
He didn't have any.
Ok, so let's talk money.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Have you ever seen so much crap?
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.
Okay! All right!
Okay. Okay.
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Alright, well, be good, I love you.
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
One second.
All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice.
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
I don't have too. I can just look at you.
Not nice enough.
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
I'm Scott.
Yeah, okay, Scott!
My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
Okay, Chandler, come on!
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
No-no I heard! I'm just sorry.
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
Hey Pheebs!
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
God I know, you're right.
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
Okay, good luck
No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Stop!
We'll talk later.
Yeah. Thank you.
Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
You still work at the multiplex?
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy.
Hey.
God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.
Yeah he was wasn't he.
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
Dad, dad.
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I'm your mother.
No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
Oh.
Heh?
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.
Yeah.
So.
Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
Ohh, Ross, please!
One more day, seriously/
So, then you can stay as long as you want.
I wish I could.
Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
Oh, umm, all right.
So how did you know Francis?
Really?! What's your name?
Umm, Frank Buffay.
Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking.
I know.
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
Chandler.
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
For real?
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Well I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh! I'm getting all misty here! You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
We?
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
You okay?
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Really stupid.
Yeah. No. No...
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
That would work.
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
Huh.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
It's textbook.
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
She could be you.
Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
Me too! I'm sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
Absolutely. Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to...
Oh my God, who died on this?!
Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could...
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
Well, can you blame her?
Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
Really?
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Oh God! I gotta go!
Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
Yeah, isn't that great?
Mmm.
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Really?
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Well...I Only Have One Thing To Do Today. I guess I could push it back.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
Chandler?
I-I'm sorry?
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
That's OK.
We can't do that.
What? What can't you do?
Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
Who's next?
Hi there!
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
Okay.
Okay, but.
Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go...
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Oh. Whew!
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
I think that's fair.
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
No. But that reminds me, sign this.
What is it?
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
Ross.
Chandler.
Hey, you guys.
Happy birthday.
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Hey. Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Oh yeah man. Joey.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
I forgot my purse.
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Hi Monica.
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
Hmm.
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Oh?
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
No, I'm sorry.
I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
I'd really rather talk to him.
Oh.
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
Charles.
It-it's so great to see you both here.
Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
Oh my God!
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
Really? That okay, that's great.
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Yes it does.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
Alright, go on.
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Yeah. How 'bout that.
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
I used to love to play restaurant.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
Ah, that's OK, come on in. Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Hey!
Who isn't?
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!
Yeah, refrigerator college.
Yeah.
You can't give up on your dream.
No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
Hopefully.
Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
How long do cats live?
I'm sorry?
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
You put your balloons down!!
Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
Ugh! So close!
Hey you guys! Look!
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
Ross.
Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and...
Really? That okay, that's great.
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Larry?
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
And where is your hat?
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
Yeah, they're out of town.
Ohh.
Yeah that works.
They-they-they can smell fear.
The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
How did you know there was a but?
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
I can do that.
Really?
We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!
'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch...
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Uhh, yeah.
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
Aw, Mom...
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Well, they don't have to know that...
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
I'll never forget you.
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
There y'go, kids.
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Chandler's a girl!
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
Okay, keep saying it!
Am I too late?!
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
Oh please!
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I... I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have...
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Shut up!
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
That's because they are.
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
Oh no!
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
I am so sorry.
That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again.
Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life.
All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
Yeah, I got that.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
3, 2, 1. Happy New Year.
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
In the moment, yeah.
So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
Dr. Franzblau, hi.
Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
What?
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
Thank you, sir.
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
Hey.
Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
So. How'd you guys meet?
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Just us.
Oh, what a crappy night!
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
So, do we have the best friends or what?
Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...
This?
Uh-huh.
She wasn't a hooker.
Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
So...What?
Yes!
Okay.
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
Wow!
You keep saying that.
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Okay..
Wow.
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo
Hang on.
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Two.
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
No, back to happy. Back to happy!
No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
No, Frank.
No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
Please tell me you're stopping now.
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
It's nice.
Oh. Oh.
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys.
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
She said what?
Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
OK, everyone gather up.
'Scuse us
Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that?
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
Come on man, you're not a potato.
I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
You wanna what?!
What are you talking about?
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
What?
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
Thinkin' about it.
Buddy, my monkey?
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
Okay, I love you.
That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
Good luck.
You too.
I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Uh-huh.
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
Really?!
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
Whoa!
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
Oh, just had a baby.
Mazel tov!
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Working with blind kids.
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
You are?
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car.
What do you need from the car?
Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
Wow! What do you do now?
I'm a party planner. I'll see you tomorrow.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
So that's your second marriage in two years.
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
I wonder how long that milk has been setting out.
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Um, what- what would make you think that?
Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
Bye!
I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
Eh.
Oh, you got me.
Oh, that sounds great.
Come on over here, sweetheart.
Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
Where did you hear it from before?
I heard that.
Hey.
Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
You're welcome.
Hate that guy!
Night, you guys.
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
No-no-Really?!
Of course!
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
So I was wondering....
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Oh, really.
But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
Kick save and... denied.
Man you are incredible.
Well, we had a table in college.
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
How do you mean?
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Ahh, ahh, excuse me.
Yeah?
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
But it's my car!
Yeah, but it's my wax.
Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
I'm not coming back.
They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
Okay, what was wrong with that call?
Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
Oh.
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
Again, very sorry.
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Huh.
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Oh God.
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
You bet. Maybe some other time?
Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
What's going on?
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
You okay man?
Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
That's right!
Hey Estelle, listen...
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Really?!
And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
Daddy cut me off.
Never mind, I got it.
Wow! What did he say?
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
Well, how-how come?
That's just the way it is.
Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
What?!
Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
Really?
Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just-I want you to be happy
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
That's so sweet.
Living with you would make me happy.
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
Your... excuse me?
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
Oh, wow.
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
The head tilt?
I'm sorry.
No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.
Or your keys.
Ok.
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad.
It's not?
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
I think I lost. Three times.
Uh...Cookie?
Yeah, sure.
Okay, all right. Let's do it. And...Action!
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
Janice.
Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Hey-hey, what's going on?
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
You're saying, my wife is in you?
Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
Everything?
Everything.
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
That counts!
Oh, good!
I Ross...
Take thee, Emily...
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
We should?
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?
Yeah sure.
Earl Grey?
Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out...
Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?
Whatever! What about you Meg?
Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
No, that was clenching.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
God, I love these fingers...
I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
Well, that's really a different question.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
What?!!
There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
What can we do for you?
All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
I know! I can't wait!
Were you're parents happy, or something?
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
I wish I could.
Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
You didn't!
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Uhh, no-no thanks.
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
Oh hey, Pheebs!
Hey!
Yeah, okay, my bad.
Hey!
Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Ethan?
Yeah?
Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Well...
Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future &#150;and-and-and we were getting married or something.
What?
No, no, don't. Why don't we?
Why don't we what?
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
But that's what...
I should just be happy to be near you.
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
'Scuse me?
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
My God! You love me!
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Are you close with them?
No-no, they're not very nice people.
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
And he was my best student.
Yeah, she was my best teacher.
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
I stepped in something icky.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
Oh.
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
No, none at all.
None.
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
What?! What would make you think that?
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
What?
That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking...
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
Yeesss.
Fine, go have sex.
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
Honey.
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
Zoo dollars?
Ooohhh.
I know.
Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.
You really need the bassinet?
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Uh-huh.
Look I want you, now.
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
Normally, I would not do it.
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
Say you're sorry.
No.
Well, yes, it's kind've an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
Knock, knock, knock.
Ah, oh, hang on a second. Come in, come in. All right, so think about it, and call me back.
No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
You were gonna propose?
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
I know. I hate that!
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
Yeah, well.
Oh yeah, I'd love that.
Oh, great! Me too.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
I stepped in something icky.
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
What?
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
What do you mean?
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
What do we got there?
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
You think I'm hot?
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
Hello, is Ross there?
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know...
Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
Ooh, erotiery!
Okay.
I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Yuh.
Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
Absolutely. Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to...
Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Can we please turn this off?
Noo way, Kevin.
Are you intrigued?
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
You're strict.
It's for their own good.
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
Well, she has issues.
Does she.
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! Here! Hey man, you want the aisle?
Oh, you thought, huh? Yeah, well that didn't really work out too well for you did it you idiot!! What are you?! A moron!! Huh?! It says D-13! Okay?! Look you're surrounded by even numbers!! Did that give you some clue?!
Uh, the usher told us to come...
No, I'm good.
There he is!
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
Things change, roll with em.
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
I'm sorry. See ya.
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
Julie.
Ohh. Hi!
And bus.
Oh my god.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Phoebe!
Oh, hi Ross!
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
Yes!!
Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
There she is.
Mom!
Pretty much.
Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.
Oh that's too bad.
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
'Kay!
Bye.
And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life...
Yeah?
Wow.
There's one thing missing.
Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.
Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.
Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.
Oh.
I'm a waitress.
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!
Well now it's an empty bar.
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
I won! That was my guess!
What?! What?! What?!
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
Well ah, what can you swing?
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.
What?
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
Oh, you're not a dingus.
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
Well thanks.
And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
Okay.
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
One swift kick and he'll back off.
All right, bad ankle, got it!
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.
Oh! Wow! Hey!
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
That's all right, that's well, I figured....
Hey!
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
Kim, hi.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Oh, really?
The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
Oh, what? What was it?
Yeah, no, it was great.
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
I'm a waitress.
Yeah. Gotcha.
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
I-I sure will, take care.
Oh.
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
No, I, I only know Lipson.
Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
I'm 16.
See you in 2003.
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Yeah, thanks.
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
He's a he?
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Umm, I think you're really, really great...
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
Oh! That's fine.
Great! Okay, good for you!
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
I can't believe this.
Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
I had a bra.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
Hey guys!
Hi Janine!
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
Yeah, that's what I said.
Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
Me?!
Nice!
Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
I, I know.
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
Ok will do. So glad you came.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"
What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in.
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
Where do I know you from?
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
Whattaya mean?
Wow. Thank you.
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
My uncle Marcel.
Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
Both of you?
Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
How are you honey?
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
What's this?
It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
Y'know I have dinner plans!!
Whoa.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
Wh-what's up?
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing...
Oh just say it Kyle!
We're gonna give it another try.
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
Who's they?
No one.
Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
It's all right. Sweetheart.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
Well, uh, I ate some.
Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
I didn't... I never said that.
Okay, I'm sorry.
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
Right, and...
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
But you've only slept with two people.
Right.
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
What're you doing?
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
Honey, we gotta go!
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Oh.
But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I'm your mother.
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
Are you intrigued?
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in.
This is impossible. Its just impossible.
What is, honey?
Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"
And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
No. A break from us.
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
Oh, hi Chloe.
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....
Hey!
Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
So how did everything go?
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
Wow! What did he say?
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Rach?
It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
Or?
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-
Hey!
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
So. How'd you guys meet?
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
I don't know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy... Why can't I just pick someone like you?
Of course I do.
Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
Thanks.
You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you're just so, you're so, so...
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
Shhhh!
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
And there is Kevin.
Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
How close?
Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Oh, what a fun office.
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
How can I help you?
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
Hey.
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
Wow!
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Uh-oh!
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
Yeah.
Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Okay, so it's a date.
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
Ohh, impressive.
Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
Uh, hang out?! How long?
No!
Eh, worth a shot. Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
Ugh, tramp!
Does Joey have any idea?
Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
Yeah! That would be great!
Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
We don't have to.
Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
She said what?
She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
What's up?
But what about Phoebe?
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
Oh my God!
Really?
Thank y...
Girls, sit down.
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
But at least the apothecary table is real.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
That's totally understandable.
Don't worry about it.
This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
Believe me, sometimes that happens.
Really?
Yes.
Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
Okay.
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Bob here.
Oh, hi.
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
What?!
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
What?!
What.
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
...Flame Boy.
Where exactly is your zoo?
Yes.
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
Really?!
Well, I, umm...
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
...And what did you bring?
Janice?
Oh.... my.... God.
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
My fish, Buddy.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
That's not true?
No.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
More turkey Mr. Chandler?
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
Alright, we'll share.
No, give me the...
That's it! Dinner is over!
What?
I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"
Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
Im gonna be a father.
Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
It's actually going to be just family.
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
What about Benitez?
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
Ohh!!
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Tell it again. Seriously.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
No! I mean he's nice.
Yeah.
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?
Oh, yeah?
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
Ok, that's so nice.
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
But what about Phoebe?
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Uh--
I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
Why?
Okay.
I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
Why not?
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.
Oh my God!
Really?
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Yes it is.
How do you know?
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh?
Oh sweet Moses.
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
Nice.
Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
That guy Lipson?
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Uhh, yeah.
See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Okay, great.
I'll catch you guys later.
Hey!
Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,
I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
Why not?
Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Yeah!
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Yeah, it is.
Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?
Why not?
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Why?
I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
What?!
What?!!!
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Then why would he say it?
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Bob here.
What've you been up to?
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
I know.
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together.
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
But what does that gonna do...
For Chandler!
Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
Yeah-yeah.
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
Yeah.
Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.
Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
Oh, I love you too. But...
No but, no but.
That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
I know I would.
Hey no problem.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
Chandler!
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
It's lovely to meet you.
Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
Thank you. What a bitch.
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
Thank you, Max. Thank you.
So-so you're really not going?
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Kill me. Kill me now.
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
Thank you.
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
Ross!
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach.
So, does that mean the audition is off?
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
Here's my binoculars.
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
Oh, yeah. What's this?
Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
That is funny.
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
Oh yeah. See you guys.
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
Oh, no I don't.
I did, but...
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Say more things like that.
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
Like-like what?
Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
Oh, you forgot?
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Doug!!
Hmm.
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
I would really like that.
Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...
Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Could you speak up please?
Daryl Hannah.
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
That's a defense?
You make up songs?
Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.
We have heard you play.
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
Okay! All right!
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
Chandler is fantastic!!
What?!
Oh, I....
Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?
You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
That's about 60 cents.
Every night!!
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Hi Frank.
We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Aw, don't do that
Ok, thanks.
Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
Look, can, can you do something for me?
Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
Hi, thanks for coming in again.
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
No. No. I don't think so.
Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
I mean really, think about it.
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
Since then?!
...I d'know.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
It's about you.
Oh, okay then.
Good. So what were you thinking?
I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
Monica said that did she?
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
What is wrong now?!
This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then...
Okay. Sometimes I feel...
No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go...
Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
Okay, but.
Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
Oh my God!
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
Yeah!
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Marry me.
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Oh.
What?
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
'Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."
Oh yeah, of course you don't!
No.
I didn't... I never said that.
You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
Just those two!
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Here.
The receipt.
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Really? Me?
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Oy.
Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Hey.
Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
Feelings, such strong feelings.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
Hey, how long are you in the city?
Oh, this is my friend Roger.
Hi.
All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
What can we do for you?
Well, what about his family?
He didn't have any.
You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
This is so great.
Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you're a real special lady, but my divorce isn't final yet and, and, and we've been on four days, so I'm thinking "No, but thanks."
What?!
Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
YOU IDIOT!!!!!
Your name, please?
Okay, my next song's called Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .
Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done.
Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
Hey Phoebe.
You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Umm, I'm still here.
What?!
Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.
Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
Sorry, what?
It's the Gellers!
Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
So what are you saying? It's now or never?
'Cause uh, this is today's Post and uh, these are the listings I found. Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights!
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
Umm, yeah! Today's.
Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?
No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
What were you doing in Africa?
Working with blind kids.
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
Scene 5, take 1.
And Action!
Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
I-I-I...
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
Hard quality.
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I'm afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.
Ehh, pardon me?
But he has to know how I feel!
But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
I don't think so.
Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.
What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
It's not a library...
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
...Like, ...all of them?
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
I wa-
Uuuh.
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
What?
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
Well, we were...
I'm not asking!
Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
Long story, honey.
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?
Good luck!
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
You think about it.
So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?
Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's.
There is no alley behind Macy's.
Our next cocktail party?
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
No way, forget it.
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
What.
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
This bill for my half of the wedding. it's insane.
How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
I came to talk to you about Howard.
Howard?
Oh that's nice.
Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or...
Alrighty. Were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why dont you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummys head.
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
Oh, good. Thisll be fun.
What? What? What?
I am supposed to be the mommy?
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
I know.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
When I was six years old.
Hm-mmm.
That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.
You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
What?!
Okay, umm, you're a loon.
Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
So how long have you known?
And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
Her name's Debra.
It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
Yeah.
Yeah. Hmmmm.
No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
Why?
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
Is it bad?
I'll talk to her.
I hate actors.
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
That's okay.
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
What are you talking about?
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
Joey, right?
Yeah.
Oh no-no-no, you don't understand...
Listen to me!
Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?
Yeah, why?
No reason.
Tribbiani.
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
What do you mean?
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.
Well, then who's been dead for five years?
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Oh!
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Oh, I couldn't eat now.
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
Yeah, you're right.
Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
Why, does she have a bad personality?
Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
What is with him?
With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
Nope. Schhorry.
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
Wow! If only more people knew.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Hi!
Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
What is going on?
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
Looks like that might come any minute.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
Happy to.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
Kinda.
Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
I got you...these.
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
That's great.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
Hey.
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
They do!
Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
Any time.
Ross.
Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
Would you look at them?
Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.
Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
Just, you know, to see... um.
OK, is this really my father?
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Hold on, you-you knew?
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
...He's in.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Yo- hooo!
Where the hell've you been?
Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
Yes!
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
What's going on over here?
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
Hi. Hi.
What are you doing here?
...I'm, I'm okay.
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I... I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have...
My God! You love me!
What?
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.
Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.
Oh, okay.
Wow! Umm....
I dropped a cup.
Here we go people! Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la... Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
Good bye Ross.
Uh, oh-ho bye.
Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is... Thank you, boys and girls, you've ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother's crab cakes! Excuse me!!
No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
Right.
No, back to happy. Back to happy!
Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
No, Frank.
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
There's more alcohol, right?
How you doin'?
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
Is that all?
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
Nooo.
Hi, Kate!
From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
God Ross, what is that?
Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
I love you, Pete!!!
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
It's the basketball playoffs.
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
Uh, it's the college playoffs.
No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
Uh-huh. G-good deal.
I'm sorry.
Oh my God, I didn't...
I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
Hhhhiiiii.
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
Ohh, ohh.
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
Can I please see your face?
Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
Your grandmother would have hated this.
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
That sounds like Nana.
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
I did, but...
Call me!
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Chandler! You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being.
What happened son?
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Thank you!
No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! Huh?!
Ice coffee? Tell me it's ice coffee!
It's-it's hot...
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
No you robot!!
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
Of course, what happened?
I don't want to talk about it.
Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
I came to give you this and this.
Oww! Big ring!
Hold on, you-you knew?
Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
Yuh.
Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Sure.
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
You're next!!
Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
No, let me explain! Fired!!
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Daryl Hannah.
Hard quality.
-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
You sure?
Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Sure.
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
But you're not bald.
It's not on my head.
Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
I'm wearing two belts.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
It's so secluded up here.
Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
No.
Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!
Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
It's not random, it's Bob.
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
You asked him too?!
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...
I'm coming over tonight though, right?
Oh yeah. Definitely.
I, Emily...
Take thee Ross...
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
You want some help.
No help required Chico.
You see, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious...you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater...
I'm in love with you.
Well that brings me in the loop a little.
Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
Hi, thanks for coming in again.
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
Cat hair.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
Well, tell him, apology accepted.
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
Hey, the man's dog just died.
I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
Oh my God!! Great!
Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there's an age difference between us.
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here?
I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
Okay, bye.
No.
Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I'm family, I'm it. Now, now I'm done.
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
How do you mean?
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
Don't spoil it.
Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
The Waltham Residence.
Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
What are you saying?!
Now, let us try that again, shall we?
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
Yeah, OK.
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
So, what are you saying now?
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life... It's raining men!
You okay?
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Hallelujah!
It's raining men!
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Really.
Good, they feel good, in my head.
So, it's great to see ya.
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
How are you?
What are you doing here?
What happened?
Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
How was that possible?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, you thought, huh? Yeah, well that didn't really work out too well for you did it you idiot!! What are you?! A moron!! Huh?! It says D-13! Okay?! Look you're surrounded by even numbers!! Did that give you some clue?!
Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh...
Oh, well I thought that ah...
Uh, the usher told us to come...
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! Here! Hey man, you want the aisle?
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
My friend's name is Joey.
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London-well Shropshire really but y'know-well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening?
Rachel! Could I have a moment?
Yes.
Sure. You got it. Great!
Oh, good.
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
Ya know, she's having another baby.
I thought she just had one.
Oh, you're a grandpa.
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.
Hmm.
Why did you hire me?
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Okay, I didn't hear that.
Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
Hi Frank.
Hi, Mrs. Knight.
Yeah, but not just that.
Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less...
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
All right, on the table.
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Promise me you'll be careful.
I promise.
Oh you don't have to be sorry. I'm...I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't...picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh...kiss good-bye? No? Okay.
Shut up!
I'm sorry!
Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna...
What the hell was that?!
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
Me too.
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
So did you ask him?
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
Yeah, Sarah, anything.
Yesss?
Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
Oh?
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
I guess you can.
Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
I have actually not heard of that.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
What did you do when they found out?
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
Yeah?
I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
Mmm-mmm.
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
It's ok. I'm sorry.
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
You do?
Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
So...What?
So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
What a wank!
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
Oowww!!
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Okay.
So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
No, don't worry about it.
This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
Nothing I do means anything, really.
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
Phoebe...
Yeah?
That's so sweet.
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just-I want you to be happy
We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
What?
What?
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.
Yes?
Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
Wait!
Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
Let me get that. You got five bucks?
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
Her name's Debra.
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
Sure.
But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
Oh my God!
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
Ohh.
What?!
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
What?!
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
Have fun.
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
I am Guru Saj.
Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
What's a koondis?
I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
That's a good one!
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
You probably want us to move in together?
It doesn't scare me!
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Honey, this will help.
Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!!
So you're the gynaecologist?
Hey, I'm trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
Thomas, come back here!
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
Well, up yours too!
Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Hello.
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
That's what it sounded like.
Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
Oh God.
Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make...
Uh-huh.
Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
Really? Because I think about you all the time.
Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?
What?!
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
Yeah, yeah. Why?
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
When?
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
I didn't realize that.
Yeah.
Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
See if he has ice.
Okay.
Oh. Oh!
So where are we going next?
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
Well so?
I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
I stepped in something icky.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is... Thank you, boys and girls, you've ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother's crab cakes! Excuse me!!
Here we go people! Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la... Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
Anyone mind if I save this?
Hey!
I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
Oh, hi Chloe.
And that's the only colour that comes in.
Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
Sure.
Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Rrrreally.
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
Oh.
I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello.
Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
'Cause uh, this is today's Post and uh, these are the listings I found. Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights!
Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Phoebe...
...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
Wow! Umm....
I dropped a cup.
Oh, this is so great.
Yeah, it was.
Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Oh well, no I...
I-I-I think you look great.
Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
What uh-What did you-What?!
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
What?
I got a little drunk...and naked.
No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
I'm sorry.
Oh, that's too bad.
I'll survive.
I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello.
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
Hi.
Ross, I love you!
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
We're on in 3, 2,
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.
Except stilts.
Stilts?
Wow.
Yeah.
Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
I'm...happy...for you?
Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
What's the matter?
It's Fun Bobby.
Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
Yeah, take your time.
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
Not all bad.
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
I-I'm sorry?
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
You will like it!
Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Sure we should... So.
Okay.
Will you be my maid of honour?
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
Hi, thanks for coming in again.
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
Wow!
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
Then don't leave me!
What?
That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
I wanna gooooooo!
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Saw a girl with that vest.
Thanks.
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
Hi!
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
What woman?!
Chelsea.
Can I be that guy?
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
Maybe.
I think so.
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
True story.
They're here already?
It was.
Then, what's the problem?
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
Okay. Okay.
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
So you talked to your dad, huh.
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.

Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
You do Pheebs?
Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next.
Step away from the duck.
Ooh, sorry little Mr. Chic-A-Dee, sorry you went doody in my hand! Well, I guess we're not going out anymore. Whaa!!!
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
You didn't know that already?
Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
Listen to me!
Oh yeah, yeah.
Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
Just relax. Just relax Paul, you're doing great. She likes you. She... Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y'know why? Because you're a neat guy. You are the man. You are the man! I still got it. Nice and sexy. You're just a love machine. I'm just a love machine and I won't work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! Showtime. I'm just a love machine, yeah ba-by!
Okay.
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
Phoebe!
Yeah?
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
Oh, sweetie, oh.
Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
What?
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Uh-huh.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!
That's just the way it is.
That's crazy.
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
Okay.
All right, I'm sorry.
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm... Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
Joey, had reasons.
They were threefold.
Open the box!!
What?!
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...
I sure did!
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
Hey!
Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
Well it's not Sean Penn.
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
Phoebe's got another job, right?
