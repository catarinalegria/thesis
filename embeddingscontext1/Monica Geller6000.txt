Okay.
How was that possible?
Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.
Okay.
Unless...
Hey!
No.
Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
What?
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Eeaagh!
Yeah.
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
No.
Mm-hmm.
Wh- are you welling up?
You are, you're welling up.
Am not!
What?!
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Hey.
Joey-
Ah! Huh?
Hey.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
No!
We are not going to whistle.
Come on, do it.
Do it!
No!
Okay!
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Okay!
Emily?!
Hi.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Mmm.
So how'd it go?
Really?
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
That'd be good...
No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Wow!
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
Chandler!
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Oh.
Oh.
What?
Ethan called again.
Are you not seeing him anymore?
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Hi!
Lucky sixes....
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
And Joey....
Hi!
Why?
But I didn't.
Well, you should have.
Because!
Why?
Yeah!
Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
Come on, play that funky music white boy.
No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
Okay, guys.
Yes!
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
He finally asked you out?
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Joey!
Well then get it, get it!
That tone will not make me go any faster.
That one will.
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Ross!
G'bye, Nana.
Bye, Nana.
What is going on?!
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
Chandler.
Chandler, why are you doing this?
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Phoebe!
This is not the bed I ordered!
I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
Why is this car in my bedroom?
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
Rachel!
Hey! New wallet, huh?
Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
What?
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Oh!
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Ow!
I'm outta here.
Phoebe.
Um
Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
I know.
Mrs. Geller?
She looks so small.
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
G'bye, Nana.
Ross.
No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.
Yeah.
Looks like he's playin' baseball.
Bye.
Yeah.
Bye.
Bye.
She's dating. She's dating.
Thanks.
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
I think he's across the hall.
There y'go.
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Hello?
Would you like to call somebody?
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
Hey, it's me.
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Joey.
Chandler.
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
It may not be a bed of roses.
Rachel.
Really?!
No. Why?
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
Yes.
Thank you.
Okay, let me just change.
Hey.
Hey!
Monica.
Rachel.
What?
Oh.
Hi.
Ohh!
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
She said she'd call me.
Oh God.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Alright.
Only if you say his full name.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
You're getting a cat?
Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.
Chandler?
Okay!
Oh yeah.
Yeah?
That's the couch.
Huh?
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
I know!
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
How long do you want the cuffs?
At least as long as I have the pants.
I do?
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
You know where I work!
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
You still work at the multiplex?
I...
All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
What happened?
Why is this happening to me?! I don't know, maybe it's my wound.
Forget it.
OK.
Oh... shoot.
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
Take care.
You too.
Phoebe?
Pizza guy!
Thank God. Food.
What?
Do you have a plan?
Wow.
Mmm-mmm.
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
Aren't you going to swallow that?
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
I do.
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
I do.
Yeah you do!
Rings?
Great!
They're so small!
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Nothing.
What?
What's different?
Oh, maybe that's it.
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Ow!
I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Uh-huh.
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Why?!
She said that?!
Yeah.
I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
Nooo!
The green dress? Really?
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
Hey. Got a second?
Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...
Whoa!
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
Wait! Okay!
Oh my God!
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Bye!
Haven't we made this decision?
Yeah, all right.
Bye!
Who is it?
Great.
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Relax, I'll fix it.
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
Oh...
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
I hope it's okay.
"Happy Birthday Peehe."
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
Richard!
Come on in.
Hi!
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Sure.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Yeah?
What's up?
I thought of a thing.
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Yes!!
Did you like learn about her family?
Two brothers, one died!
Yeah?!
Oh!
I did.
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Not me.
Fine!
You did a minute ago!
Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
You found that handle, did ya?
Hello.
Hey.
Hello.
Going to the hospital tonight?
No, you?
Noo!!
Noo!!!
Yes!
Yes!!
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Ohh.
I'm sorry?
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
All right. Mmm-mmm.
Ow!!
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Isn't there a national football league.
Rach?
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Yeah?
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
Right.
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
So, you look great.
No you do. You... just...
What?
Sorry.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Okay.
Sorry.
I can hear that!
Umm.
Sorry, Phoebe.
It's okay. How's the soup?
Ohhhh!! Gross!!
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
Oh God!
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Fine,
Yes.
Fine.
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
Hmm?
Thanks.
Thank you. Mon?
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
How?
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Okay, that we may be able to do.
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Nope.
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Yep, yep...You?
Ok.
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
I hear ya.
We can talk about that.
Pete.
You still have feelings for me don't you?
Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Please!
Get out!
Nooo!
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Wow! What's that like?
Really!
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
You know what I like most about him, though?
Sure!
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Chandler! Is he?
Ugh!
Hi!
Oh my good God.
I know what time you said.
What?!
Um-hmm.
See, that's why we don't let her play.
Is everything all right?
Uh-oh.
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Well?
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Uh, uh.
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Hey.
What?!!
I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Excuse me, there was no time!
Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
When?
It's the museum again, can I, oh.
Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here.
Oh you are so lucky.
Who?
And his puppet too.
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
Paul.
Oh.
You what?
Dad!
Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
Define fun.
I'm sorry.
The head tilt?
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
Oh, that's too bad.
You okay?
I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Yeah.
Really?
Absolutely!
So we can go out again?
Oh yeah!
Oh good.
Oh well then, good night!
Bobby.
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
Yeah, OK.
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Chandler!!
Very bad.
Chandler what are you doing?!
Oh my God!
You're smoking again?!
Congratulations!
Okay.
I got it! Mine!
Thank you!
Okay! My turn! My turn!
Dad!
Here's my retainer!
I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
You what?
Huh.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
More wine, dear?
Oh, I think so.
Joey!!
So she's a woman! So what?
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
The green dress? Really?
Look!
Wait, wait, wait!
Look, Monica...
This is not going to work.
I bet this will work!
Maybe.
Are... are you OK?
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
Don't toy with me.
Geller!
Now?
Okay!
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Oh, I-I don't know.
Really.
Could you get us a couple of beers?
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
Good, they feel good, in my head.
Shhh!
Yesss!!
Who's Chip?
Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Uh-hmm.
Okay!
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
Oh my God! I love that!
Umm...
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Wait up!
Where?
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
There he is! There he is!
Right- where we've been looking all night!
He is so cute!
Yay!
That is so made up!
Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
There you go.
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Yes?
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Mon-Monica?
Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.
I was.
Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
Did she leave a number?
You too.
Good, they feel good, in my head.
So, it's great to see ya.
You too.
OK, um. Goodbye.
Absolutely.
Oh, yeah!
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Break!
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
Okay.
Here you go!
Chandler! Chandler!
Break.
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
I thought you meant in life.
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Deal!
Six.
Challenge extended.
Challenge excepted.
All right, we'll start with...apples.
Ennnh.
I know.
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
I've got canned goods.
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Game!
Bing!
Oww!!
Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. Are you all right sweethart?
I'm not all right.
Gin.
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
I KNEW IT!!!!
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Will you stop!
Great...
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Oh, yay...
Hi!
Hi, so what happened?
Ha-ha!
Orange juice.
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
They have another guess.
Okay, well, we won that one.
Hexadrin.
Yes.
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Hey!!
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
No, it's just my luggage.
Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Joan?
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Julie.
Judy.
Who?
What?!
Jody!
Larry?
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
Yum-my!
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Maurice.
Thanks man.
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Correct, his profession was?
Space cowboy!
Megan!
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Monica!
You came?!
Mmm-mmm.
I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
Wow.
Morning.
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Hey.
Where ya goin'?
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
No!!
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!
No?
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
Nooo!!
What?
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
Yes!!
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Oh!!
Give it. Give it.
Okay.
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Ohhhh!
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
So, what are you gonna do?
Okay!!
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
You wanna share it?
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
It's not mayonnaise!!
Okay..
Uh, Joey..
Oh, God!
Oh! That was Lambchop!
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Oops.
Oh, you look so great.
Ahh, so do you, beautiful.
What?
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
Pheebs?
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Huh?
Where's your bed?
Please.
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Rachel?!
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
And I just want a million dollars!
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Can I get you some coffee?
Ready?
Okay.
Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Ready!
Come on eight.
Stop!
Hi, Paul, is it?
Thank you! Thank you so much!
No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
We'll talk later.
Unless...
Okay.
Okay.
What?
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
dammit!
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Oh! No, not really.
You know!
It is not over! You're over!
What?
Okay. Good one.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Oh, sorry.
You look good!
I feel good! ...Who are you?
I'm Phoebe Buffay.
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
You do?
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Oh, here.
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
See now it feels like Christmas!
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
And you?
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
I thought it was... quite tasty.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
That's me.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
All right.
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
Okay, good luck!
I'm fine.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
Would you please get some rest!
"Happy birthday to you!"
You're paying for that.
I know!!
Yes! Have you seen it?
Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
I promise.
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
All right, that's it, I quit.
Oh, great!
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
No.
Oh God.
And-and a power tie?
No, pretty much just a towel.
So you guys want me to take this back?
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Oh good.
Totally!
We don't have to come up with this now.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Changes?
Oh Joey!
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
No she hasn't.
Yeah, right.
What are you smiling at?
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
Hello.
I love this friend thing!
I understand.
Are you guys gonna be okay?
Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
Wow.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
I will.
Chandler.
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Do you want me to call?
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
I don't know.
Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
What?!
That's what you said last night.
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
Okay, great!
We have a ladle.
Thanks, see you at the party.
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
-leg?
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
...Pheebs?
Oh, like that's a word.
Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
1250.
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
Damn, I forgot you were here.
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
A-ha!!!
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
Won't you dance around with me.
'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
Ross!!!
Ah!
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Ok, Mom never hit.
Ok, all done.
Ahhh!!
Oooh!
I get to hire my own assistant!
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
And you were at this job for four years?
And?
What are you trying on now?
The fruit roll up.
Delicious.
Joey!
Aww...
Really?
Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Big day.
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
Awwwww...
Monica's a little drunk.
Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
Betrothed...
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
...betrothed couple.
Hey!

So how's Mindy?
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
Hell is filled with people like you.
He's back! The peeper's back!
Bunny!
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
What?
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Thank you.
Bye-bye!
Okay, bye-bye!

Okay, I need a date!
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
Bye-bye.
Impressive.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.

You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.
C'mon!
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
Changes?
Oh good.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Charity?
Like?
Charity.
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
Claws?!
Clogs.
No.
No.
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
Clogs.
Does it involve clogs?
Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
No.
Claws?!
Continue.
Do you want me to pick you?!
See, I would never snap at you like that.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
Cups.
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
Like what?
Cups? You're giving me cups?
And ice!
Curry.
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
Mmmm!
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Cute.
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
Ross, that is gorgeous!
Done?
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Yep!
Hey!
Duh-huh!
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
And that wasn't fun for you?
I can't believe you hated me.
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
Enough!
Thanks.
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Lean-lean-lean!
"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"/Happy holidays, everybody!
Ethan?
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Yeah?
Are you a virgin?
Eww!!
No.
Does it look like a urinal?
So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
Ewww!

Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Oh, OK.
Excellent!
That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
Very informative!
Not at all inappropriate!
Fat?!
Why?
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Go!!
Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Yep!
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Hah!
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
That true, I am flaky.
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
Here!
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
What's this?
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Hey-hey.
EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
Hey!
So are guys doing okay?
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Hm-hmm!
You're a really good kisser.
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
Okay!
Wow! You are really fast!
Hmm.
Anybody lose this?
Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Hormones.
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
No we...
...hormones, yeah.
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Hoyt?
Really? Why?
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
Really, is he a swimmer?
In.
Really? Then why are you like that?
You by the door. In or out?
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
Janice?!
Hey! Ah!!
Guess who we ran into today?!
Isn't this amazing?
How have you been?
Jeffery.
Yeah!
So uh, who's your photographer?
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
The best man? Wow!
Jody!
Julie.
What?!
You were with Julie?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Judy.
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Who?
Julie.
Licorice?
Hey!
Hey!
Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Ohh! That's great!
Like?
Could you be less enthused?
Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
Charity.
Charity?
Marcel?
Marcel?!
Marcel?
Marcel?
Marcel?
Michael.
I'll take a look at him.
Oh, thank you.
Rachel.
What?
Mm-hmm.
Okay!
Monica. Whaddya think?
Wh- are you welling up?
No.
Mmm.
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Yeah, isn't that great?
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Mmmmm.
No.
Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
NO!!!
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
Can I help you?
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
That's not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
Oh my God.
YEAH!!! YES!!!
NOW!!!!!!!!
Go! Go! Go!
Hey...
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
Naked?
Why is Ross naked?
I-I had to show Chandler something?
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Nice.
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh?
Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
Is anyone else starting to really like him?
Nighty-nite.
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
Not a dad.
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Hey! How was sailing?
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
Women are mean!!!
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Noo!!!
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Yes!
Noo!!
Noooo!!!!
I don't know!
Good-bye.
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
Oh?
Huh?
No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Ohhhh.
Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
And, uh, and then I kissed her.
Tongue?
Ok...ay.
You're not a senior?
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
I just had sex.
Old?
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
The young hot ball and chain.
That's much better.
Once!!
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
Can I see you for a second?
All right, we're gonna play.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
One!
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Count of three?
Two!
Two!
One.
Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.
What time is it?
One.
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
Oooh!
Oh hey!
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
I get to hire my own assistant!
Ahhh!!
Oowww!!
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
Outside.
OK.
Hey, where are you going?
You can't go out there.
Why not?
Oww!
Oh, I'll have some!
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
What's the matter honey?
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
Paris?
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Keep talking.
Paul!
Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!
Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
Phil.
Phil!
Phil!
Paul!
Phil.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Hey, what's going on?
Pizza?!
Or! A bakery delivery person.
I wa-I wa-I wa...
Monica!
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
Please!!
What?!
Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
No, not getting my bra!
Ready!
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
Relieved?
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Ross!!
I'm Irish.
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
Ross!
How crazy that we'd run into you!
Ross!!!
A-ha!!!
'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
Hey!
Hey!
Sandwiches!
Come on!
30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins...now! What is Joey's favorite food?
Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
14?
Saucy!
He asked you out?!
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
What are these?
Electrical plans for the building.
Shhhh!!!
What?! You kissed!
Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
So?!
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Sooo?
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
Are you bachelors?
Nooo!
Sperm.
To the bank.
Sperm or regular?
So you're really doing this, huh?
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
Stupid.
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
What we did last night was....
Totally crazy stupid.
What were we thinking?
Thanks!
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
Yeah right.
Three!
Two!
Two!
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Tomorrow!
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
See ya tomorrow!
Can't wait!
How are we gonna get out of that one?
Tonight?
Bye guys.
Bye.
Hey, yo.
What's tonight?
Toothpick?
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Ow!
Yeah.
What are you trying on now?
Totally!
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
We don't have to come up with this now.
Oh good.
Two!
One!
Two!
Three!
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Two.
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
Uff.
Honey, this will help.
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
That is never good.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
Uh-huh!
Night.
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Um-mm.
Oh no! An asteroid!
Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
Real magic does exist.
Unless!
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Unless what?
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Urghh!!
300 dollars?!
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
What are you guys woofing about?
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Very!
Dope!
Wow, cute one!
I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Vividly.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!
You remember Janice.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Sandy.
Whaaat!
Marcel?
Oh-my-God!
Something just brushed up against my right leg!
What is it?
What!!?
What!?
You know what?
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Hello! Here we go!
What!?
What?
You know what?
You know what?
What!!?
What?!?!
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
You can spill. In the sink.
Whatever.
Looks like he's playin' baseball.
You mean hardball?
What'cha gonna' do?
Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
Which?
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Yep.

You've never met Bob, have you?
Wonderful!
...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Hi, how was the movie?
So good!
Suck-fest.
Woo-woo!
No!
Do it do it do it!
I can't believe you did that!
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
YES!!!!!!!!
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Okay!!!!!
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Yesss!!
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Hey Monica, it's Chip.
Who's Chip?
Shhh!
I'm Monica.
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Okay.
That's right.
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Ooh, steer clear of you.
Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
No, you?
Hello.
Going to the hospital tonight?
No, you?
You just asked me.
Oh, good.
Oh, I have cards!
Oh.
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
But what?
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
She keeps punching me.
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
You're right.
We didn't order cake.
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
You know.
I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
I got it!
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay.
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
Oh, Rachel!
You're kidding! Where? Where?
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Well, what's the job?
No, sorry.
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Well where's Amanda?
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
Thank you.
Excuse me?
I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
Right.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
I love you.
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
Okay, I love you.
I love you, love you.
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
I know!!!
Hello.
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
So, I'm here, ready to play.
Okay.
Do you?
Why don't you just call her?
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Don't you have to pee?
I don't know!
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
How did you do that?
Good-bye.
Noooo!!!!
You did!
I am not a pushover!
Who said you were?
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
That's great!
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Yes!
In London!
What?!
That's okay.
That was me.
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
That's all right.
That's okay.
It's work.
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
And we don't work hard?
Oh no!
I slept with Monica.
Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
You slept with my sister?
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Okay, fine.
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
They got a phone in there, right?
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
You didn't.
...Dinah?
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
Oh, I am sorry...
I gave you one job!
Come on!
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
All right, let's do it.
Okay.
All right, gentlemen, you're up first.
Oh yeah.
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
No that's not true. That is not true.
Yeah.
Alright, well tell me one of yours.
Oh, no!
Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Oh my God!
No, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
That's great.
No he went out to get pizza.
Oh really, OK.
Very tasteful.
Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
It's nice.
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
Oh. Oh.
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
Well, you know.
Well, thanks.
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
Uh-huh.
And Joey.
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Hey!
Hi, Joey.
What happened?
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Sorry.
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Oh, yeah.
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
He could hear me.
I am!!
My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart!
So, are we going in there?
You're look for laughable...
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
I wa-
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
Uuuh.
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
Come on.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Thank you!
Pick a number! That is your only job!
8. 8!
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Yay!!
I love you!
Oh my God it's old!
I love you!
Are you hugging the door right now.
No.
Oh my God!
You got screwed.
Oh my God!
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Oh, honey.
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
What do you mean?
Oh, please.
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
What? Honey.
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh man!
Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
What?
He's gonna eat the cake!
Hey, Phoebe!
Joey!
Didn't think so.
Hi, Pheebs!
Hey, Pheebs!
That's fine.
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Thank you.
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
All right!
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Why don't we take it for a spin?
Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
Oh yeah.
No! No!
Oh.
You want me to cancel it?
Okay.
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
Just go.
Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.
Why.
Surprise.
Happy birthday sweetpea.
Hey, guys.
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
Hey.
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
What?! Oh.
So what did you do today Pete?
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
What's that?
Wow.
There's one thing missing.
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
Okay.
You are?
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Yeah, what's the gala for?
You do?!
Eh, you work for that.
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
No one.
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
What? You have a date? Who with?
C'mon, what's his name?
Nothing.
Well, I do.
Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
No. Why?
Yeah.
Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Really?!
Wow, what?
No it's not, it's second.
Wow!
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Pulling what? It's second down.
Oh, why?
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
You got it.
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
No, just a salad will be fine.
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
What for?
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Hey, Monica!
It's not?
I'm sorry.
Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad.
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
You can totally, totally live on this.
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
Oh! Yeah!
You serious?!
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
That's great!
Really?!
You stink!
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
Oh! God! Wow!
Are you kidding?!
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
What's this?
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
This is not the bed I ordered!
Did not.
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
How was that possible?
Did that!
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,

Why?! What happened?!
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
Well, thanks.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Well, you know.
I'm sorry?
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
Mockolate.
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
Ohh.
What is it?
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Barry who you almost...?
Isn't it.
I'm sorry. See ya.
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
We're good.
I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
Thank you. So are we good?
We're good?
Yeah.
Really? Why?
What?
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
Hoyt?
That's true.
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
The man's got a point.
Oh, hi!
Oh no!!
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
No.
Rachel, you and Mark?!
Oh, I'm sorry.
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Where's Chandler?
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
Yeah, sweetie.
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
It is? Really?
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
No.
Are you okay?
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
What-what are you doing?
Hey guys.
Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
Hey Mon.
Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
Hey there.
Well, I just caught the live show.
Eww.
What?
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
No! Phoebe!
Just give me a chance too...
Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
Hey, Monica!
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
Hey guys!
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Hi!
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
What time?
What?!
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
What does it say?!
You didn't!
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
The park huh? A public place.
Say it.
Say you're sorry.
No.
No.
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
Stop it!
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Hi, again.
That's weird.
Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh!
Hey!
Hey!
Uh, good.
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Oh, sweetie!
Oh!
Thanks you guys! Again.
You're the best. Thanks. Oh!
What?!
I think so.
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
Maybe.
Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
I'll get it.
Hey.
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
Youre doing it again.
You're kidding!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
What?
Oh my God!!
Ross!
Oh crap!
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Oh great!
Oh my.
You're kidding?! That's great!
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Oh my God.
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
What is that?
How come? Everybody else does.
You can't.
Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
This is all of your things.
I don't care.
I think you're my favorite.
Which one do you have?
Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
I know I do.
Okay.
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Chandler.
So uh, where's Monica?
She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Oh my God!
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
What baby?
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
I love you. And I know about the baby.
Our baby.
We have a baby?
It was.
They're here already?
All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
Then, what's the problem?
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
The Richard.
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Which Richard?
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
I'll do it!
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Okay, I gotta go to work.
Well yeah.
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
You really ok with it?
Okay great!
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
Yeah!
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Okay, ready?
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
So why don't you give me your number?
Yeah.
Okay.
I am not.
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
You are so smitten.
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
What's up?
You know what, that's it, that's it.
Monica, wake up. Monica.
I thought of a thing.
Yeah?
Uh, Ross.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
I'm sorry..
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
For what?
Alright, alright, alright...
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
I'll try.
Oh, really?!
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
And ice!
Cups.
Cups? You're giving me cups?
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
Oh, Larry.
He thought you said gonad.
Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
No, bribes.
Oh, no...
Please tell me it's his mother.
Definitely not his mother.
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
Let go!
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
No! You let go!
No!
Look, Phoebe!
What is it?
Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
Step aside, ladies!
Hey, you guys.
It's coming from the living room.
I finished my book.
Hey.
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Okay. Sorry.
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Oh, you're right.
Oh, just look at her...
Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
...and I really think it should be me.
Hey.
Why not?
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
I could do that.
Got me.
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Can I get a beer.
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
I was kidding.
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Okay.
So was I.
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Hey, you guys!
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Nono, that would be me again.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey baby.
Hey! Good, you're home!
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Hey.
I made you a surprise.
It's Danny.
I don't know, clean places?
Umm, yum!
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
It's Hexadrin.
Here, take a couple of these.
What is it?
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
It's uh...
Oh, that's great. Look at that.
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
Yeah, sure.
Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
Someone in there?
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
You bet.
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Coffee house?
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
You came?!
Megan!
Monica!
Yeah!
This is my dress!
You changed?
Yeah.
Up!
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
And lucky means, more cleavage?
What was that?
Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight.
What?
That noise you just made?
Had it.
Well I've had it.
Yeah, I've had it.
Had it.
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
No, I'm sorry.
Hey.
Did uh, Ross call?
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
Okay, bye.
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
I'm sorry things didn't work out...
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
Hey sweetie.
No-no-no-no. Hey!
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Me too.
Yeah. Um... I'm out.
I'm in.
Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.
That was me.
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Or not.
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
Okay.
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
I was laughing.
Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
Out loud?
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
I got it!!
I got it!
Nice shot.
Long!
I can't believe you let them win!
What about me?
Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
Oh, no, no, it's about you.
I think you may have a drinking problem.
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Oh gosh.
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah.
Marcel?
Marcel?
Oh my!!
Stick out your tongue.
Take off your shirt!
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Tell him.
Name?
Holden McGroin.
No.
Tell him, tell him.
What?!! What?
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
Okay! Why?!
I know why!
No you don't know why!
Because! Because I was sad.
What do you mean?
You made it!
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
You're there!
You are ready to make a commitment!
Just mine?
Dad?
Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.
I'm afraid so.
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
We're kidding!
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Okay, fine, fine. You don't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
Ross, don't. Ross!
You don't want to believe me, I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny...
You're gonna what?
You mean there's more than one of us.
Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
I'm gonna tell Mom.
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
What's tonight?
Tonight?
Hey, yo.
It is our first official date. Our first date.
Uh, hello.
I know. Thanks.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good.
Shut up.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Shut up.
Cut it out.
No way!
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Uh.
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Oh.
How much?
How? I don't have any money.
Well, I have some.
Well, close to...
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Uh, yeah.
Hey.
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Y'know what, pretty good.
Okay. Umm...
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Okay, what's going on with you?
How are you?
Hi.
Hey.
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Hi Chandler.
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
Hey!
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Yeah, so?
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Forget it.
I...
Why is this happening to me?! I don't know, maybe it's my wound.
So it's-it's not heeled yet?
No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
Oh, Chantal!
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Oh, really?!
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Oh, you go out with him.
Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
I'll try.
Oh, y'know..
Mmm.
So how'd it go?
Did he mention us?
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
It's only you.
Not so much.
Hey.
Wh-wh-what are you doing?
We are looking at a Playboy.
I can't do it!
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Now you do that, you're on TV.
Hey!
But I didn't.
Why would I have the keys?
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Well, you should have.
Why?
That was you?
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
Yeah, me too.
How hot is this?!
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Hi, honey.
Why are you yelling?
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
See you later.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Oh that's great!
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Ugh, PBS!
Why not?!
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
What? I can't cancel on Joan!
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Hi Phoebe.
Hi, guys.
Hi! Phoebe.
I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
No we...
Hi guys.
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
You are beautiful.
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
Go on.
Yeah, you should.
Yeah, you should, really.
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Hold on.
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
Oh.
So Pheebs what's this guy like?
Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
I am not!
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Great! Monica's moving!
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
I called him.
No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
Nooo.
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Only here.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Hi guys!
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Hey!
Hey!
Shut up!
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Oh please, they're having sex.
So, whaddya think George is like?
I think he's shy.
You love me!
Yes, you did!
No I didn't!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
I know! I know.
Really?
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
Okay.
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
That's all right.
Do you know anything about women?
No.
Okay.
Hi.
Where's that?
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
In your atlas!
I don't have an atlas.
About what?
Joey, what's going on?
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
He's planning your birthday party.
Oh my God! I love him!
Let's do it!
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
You're welcome.
Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
Hate that guy!
Ooh, nice.
Hey!
Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
But I'm...
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
All right, you!
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
Sir! No sir!
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
I'm a twinkie.
No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
How ya doin'?
Really? I'm a hero.
Oh, this is so hard.
There you go!
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
"...by doin' it."
Joe?
I made them!
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Monica, where did you get these?!
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
And processing.
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
He carries a briefcase.
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
All of us.
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
Together.
Not at the concert.
No you didn't.
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
But I already gave them back to you!
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
Yeah! Richard!
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
There are?
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
That's right.
What? Honey.
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
Oh, please.
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
Oh my god.
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
What?
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
That counts!
Bye.
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Oh, good!
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
Yeah, it did.
Hi.
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
So, I guess this is over.
What?
We have one.
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
Ohh, get a room.
I know. Use it.
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!
Hey sweetie!
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Hey!
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Very good.
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
Thank you.
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
We'll see.
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Ankle.
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
I Gotcha!!
No I don't.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
No drops!
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Okay!
Great!
Okay.
All right, sorry.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Well, didn't you?
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
Huuh.
I might have.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
Who is it?
Bye!
Bye!
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
Oh my God.
...love you.
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
No, don't say it.
Are you're hands still wet?
Uh, moist, yeah.
Yeah, definitely!
Ohh, absolutely.
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Well, you're not.
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Well so?
Okay, well I do know you.
That's what I said.
I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
I think so too.
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
It's a four.
Oh well, lost again. That's it! You and me, outside!
I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
No you don't.
Fine! Be murky!
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Okay, I'll go!
Many are scheduled to appear.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
I was frustrated.
I can't believe you let them win!
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
It was my racquet.
I was frustrated with you!
Yeah, it's good.
Ohh! I did not get that.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Yeah, it's great.
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
I'm-I'm Monica.
Oh, they're a hoot.
And who is your friend?
Monica! Where are you from?
New York.
Yeah, I do know.
So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
Oh well y'know.
Ick, you were eavesdropping.
Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Yeah. You!
What were you thinking?
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Hello, Chandler.
Hello.
Hey!
I love you.
Wh-what's going on?
That's stealing!
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Here just...take this.
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Ohh.
That's terrible.
How did this happen?
He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.
Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
You love her!
Do you love her?
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
What-what is love really?
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
Oh, thank you.
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
I'll take a look at him.
Michael.
Rachel.
Okay, you're fine.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
Hey!
Hey!
'Scuse us
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
OK, everyone gather up.
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Alright. Phoebe?
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Yeah, alright.
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Just come.
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
What's ready?
Oh my God!
Wow! Monica!
Well, not anymore.
Really?
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
But we don't do that.
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
No, seriously.
Oh, how'd that happen?
Because I'm cooler.
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
Hey you guys! What's happening?
But you are?
So to get this part you can't be?
Nope.
Yep.
But you told them you weren't?
Ohh, fun!
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Ohh, great!
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
C'mon up.
It's Phoebe.
And Rog.
Oh, good. Rog is here.
What's the matter with Rog?
I could do that.
Why not?
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Excuse me?!
Oh, that's nice!
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
How many?
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
Nine.
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Uh, no!!
Oh my God! I love that!
Really?!
I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Okay. Four.
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Okay.
That's a low one!
Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't.
Don't do what?
Okay, it's um...
Don't do it!
I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
What?
I'm not laughing.
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
You told her!
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
Bite me.
It's my TV.
Wha-, oh, quit it.
Oh my God.
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
Hey, Danny!
Just go over and say hi.
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Hey! What's going on?
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
We're so sorry.
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
Yeah.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
'Scuse me?
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Oh, Chandler, sorry.
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Kiss me!
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Hi, Monica.
That's the couch.
Chandler?
Yeah?
Oh my God!
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Well, what happened?
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
More coffee over here, please!
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
Ooooohh!
This bicep?
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
Well it's not flexed right now!
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Me too!
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
No!
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
If you want.
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
She's still with you?
Joey, I'm in!
Please!
All right, fine.
All right. Good deal.
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Yeah baby!
So are guys doing okay?
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Honey! Dinner's ready!
Ohhh, nice.
How's the big anniversary dinner?
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
No, we kinda broke up instead.
What?!
Thanks again.
Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later.
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
I like 'em.
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
I think they're very nice.
Yeah!
I like them a lot.
I see pizza!
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Big Bird's friend.
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Hello? Who are we spying on?
I heard that!
Pulling what? It's second down.
Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need.
Well, I said it loud.
It is okay, if I stay and watch?
Hello, Joey.
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Oh! ...Hello, dear.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
This is Rachel.
Hi Steve!
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
Yeah, OK.
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
Sorry Joey
We're worried about you.
And some of us really have to pee.
Hey.
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
Here you go.
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Thank you.
Thanks
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
What's the matter?
Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Ohh, absolutely.
Yeah?
Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Yeah, definitely!
Sorry, Phoebe.
What are you doing with those?!
But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
It's okay. How's the soup?
Umm.
Very bad.
Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
Oh yeah.
Chandler what are you doing?!
Chandler!!
Honey, I'm sorry.
Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
Oh, I couldn't go in.
Are you OK?
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
I know why!
How is that ever going to happen?!
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
No you don't know why!
Okay! Why?!
The Bible?!
Rachel, get the book! The book!
Okay! Okay! Here!
I don't know!
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
The players.
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Oh yeah, who's playing?
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
The show?!
Hey.
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
I read to you.
I got you the foot massager.
You know who shaved you? That was me.
I sang. Hah!
Well,... thanks.
Are you crazy?!
What?
'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
Are you serious?
I kissed Kathy.
What?
Does Joey know?
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
Yes, you did!
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No I didn't!
No I didn't!
You love me!
I can do that!
What do you mean?
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
What are you doing?
Uh-huh, yeah!
Oh, thanks.
No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
Oh My God.
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
You'll see.
Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Oh God.
And the sex?
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
What is it?!
I can't find garbage bags!
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
I can't believe we're living here!
Nothing. Nothing.
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
What?
No-no really, was-was that not okay?
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
Sit down.
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
All right!
All right.
Put your head back.
Hey, are you okay?
Huh?
Oh, Ross you're right, I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.
My wife's a lesbian.
Cool!!
I want a baby.
It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
Oh, that's funny!
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Rachel! You okay?
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
Huddle up.
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Wow! Just like in the pros.
All right, huddle up, right over here.
Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
Okay. I suck!
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Absolutely!
Yeah!
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
Big time!
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Of course.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
Oh, you're-you're going?
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
Okay, come here!
Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
Guys, I'm happy too.
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
Who is this?
Not now.
Okay.
I am Father Kalebasous.
He's Greek Orthodox.
Yes I do!
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Well you don't.
Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Hi.
So what happened?
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
Oh, yeah, right.
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Really.
That is true.
Joey look it's really sweet...
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
I didn't change!
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
Maybe you changed?
Maybe that's the problem.
What?!
Yeah, me too!
Oh good.
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
Oh, look at that.
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
A mirror?
Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Am not!
No.
You are, you're welling up.
You're gonna be an aunt.
Oh shut up!
It's that terrible?
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Yes.
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
No it's not.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing! It's an expression.
Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
Look at this.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
Yeah?
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
Are you serious?!
What did you just say?
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Are you sure?
Ooooohh!
My God.
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Was it...?
No you're not.
Why not?
Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
Alright, check.
Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Yes, we do.
Check.
I'm in for fifty cents.
Oh my Gosh!
What?!
You got fired?!
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
Sweety...
What do you say?
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
You're bachelor pad?!
Aww, man!
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Hey Pheebs!
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Hey!
Hey, have you seen Rachel?
Oh, thank you!
Thank you.
Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
But my apartment!
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
But the mess!
I like that. What?
Really, is he a swimmer?
He's got the body for it.
You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
We do not have one of those signs.
Do I know you?
What guys? Oh, yeah.
Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
You used to be my babysitter.
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
We are there!
Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
Are you serious?
What, what are you laughing at?
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
She's bluffing!
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
It's my TV.
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
Would you guys stop.
Wha-, oh, quit it.
Bite me.
Of course!
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Really?
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
No-no-no, no!
What-what are-what are these?
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Oh my God! Look at this!
Yeah, I knew.
Hey! I didn't know either.
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Where's Chandler?
Here I am.
..Excuse me?
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Probably kill myself!
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
Including me?
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
No, there were two.
Oh yeah.
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
Don't say it.
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
...in love with you.
Really?
Mr. Heckles.
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
We won. We won!
How did this happen?
He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
No, thank you.
Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
No.
You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.
I'd love an ice water.
I don't think so.
Is Tony Randall dead?
No.
Why?
Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
No! Oyster?
Come, come here.
We can't do this.
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
What's 'pleh'?
Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
Okay, done.
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
I just asked you.
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
I just asked you.
I don't have time for this.
No, that is what the game is.
Last night.
Oh, hi sweetie.
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Hey hey hey! She's on!
You look good!
Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
I feel good! ...Who are you?
Oh, sorry.
Oh, my pleasure.
I sang. Hah!
Well,... thanks.
You're welcome.
So. I guess I'll see you around.
Not necessarily...
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
What's with him?
Are you saying I smell bad?
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
Ugh!
That's not funny.
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
You found that handle, did ya?
Well that's not true.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
Yeah, you should.
Yeah!
Just go for it Chandler.
Yeah, you should, really.
Go on.
That's your call.
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Don't, I like it dirty.
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Ross, are you okay?
Ross?
Hey Chandler. Monica!
I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Why?!
No, we don't.
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
No, I haven't.
Ohh!
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Who is it?
We should go.
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
Yeah let's head off to work.
Thank you.
Sure.
Did you like it?
Well you better.
Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
How are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
Oh, you're kidding.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Don't say it!
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
Oh my God! It didn't remind you of...
No, but it did! Didn't it?!
Yeah!
I loved them!
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
Yeah. Nice try!
Hello!
That was you?!
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
Yeah! Okay, here you go.
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
I know, it's great!
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
Aww, I don't want to see that!
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
New York.
I'm-I'm Monica.
Monica! Where are you from?
I'm not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Or 45.
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Pretty much.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
All right.
Hey Monica!
Take care.
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
OK.
You too.
What happened?
Uh, hello.
What's tonight?
It is our first official date. Our first date.
Hi.
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
I don't know sweetie.
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
No! Help me!
I can't! I have to work!
Hi, Geoffrey.
Hi, come on in.
Hey.
Hi.
Ah here, we brought wine.
Hi, Josh.
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
Hi.
Dudes.
Jacket now.
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
We'll watch him.
No, you cannot.
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
That's true!
Thanks for the help, problem solved.
Hello.
What are you doing?!
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
You got it! Oh-oh!
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Thanks. I think you got it!
Oh, I think so.
Huh.
More wine, dear?
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Thank you. They're yours.
A pill?
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
He gave me a pill for it.
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
Uh-huh, yeah.
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
Dying people say the craziest things.
Phoebe, tell her!
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
I remember you did.
Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
I know, I remember that!
God!! What am I gonna do?!
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
Yeah, what is it?
Ohh that'd be great!
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
Tomorrow night.
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
So, are you gonna see him again?
Monica, what are you doing?
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
You know Paul?
How do you do that?
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Ow!! Ow!!
Ow!
Oh!!
Ow!!!
Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
What's the part?
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!
Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Come on! That's great.
I am the best.
No, you're the best.
No, you're the best.
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Burning's good.
Or?
Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
I am 26.
Oh, I can't pass for 22?
Well, maybe 25-26.
There you go.
Can you hear that?
I am loud!
I do not like that woman!
I can hear you!
Aww!
That's funny.
Give me that.
You wanna get out of my face?
Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
OK.
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
Think about it.
Y'know, just be there for her.
Not following you.
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
Well, thank you, Melanie.
Yeah that's right.
Fine!
Excuse me, I-I couldn't help overhearing, you're marrying Chandler Bing?
Huh, good luck!
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
I know I love you!
So, what do you think we should do?
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
There's a game?
Hey, big guy, game time.
Hey, be right there.
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
It's the basketball playoffs.
She's sleeping.
Oh no! No! No!
Monica!
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
That was amazing!
Ok. One.
Nooo.
Excellent, that was excellent.
I can't believe the guys missed this.
Fifteen minutes.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Okay.
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
What do you mean?
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
That's the surprise!
Surprise!!
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
Surprise!
All right then.
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Are you gonna let me play?
The game is over, we eat now?
No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
Come on eight.
Ready?
Ready!
Yes, yes eight.
Eight! Easy eight.
Uh huh.
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
Oh, do I?
We ended up having sex in his chair.
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
You wanna what?!
Okay.
Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
What are you talking about?
What did you say?
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
Oh, you just know.
Oh, no thanks.
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
He's so cute.
Is it the Italian guy?
Um-mm, yeah right!
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
No we're not.
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
We're not?!
All right, I like that.
Okay.
Okay, in we go.
Yep! And lot's of it!
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Here you go.
This is insane!
We actually missed it.
Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
What?!
I think she's here.
No.
Ohhhh, come on!!!
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Good night!
Oh good.
Oh well then, good night!
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
We have got to move!
Keep going.
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Keep talking.
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Really?
Sorry, Rach.
Excuse me. It's about the job.
Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Yeah... ....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
That'll work!
No-no-no! We need something old!
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
I don't think so.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Hey, what's that?
Hey!
Hello!
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
Eeeee--ohh!! God!
No you robot!!
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
So you didn't mean any of that?!
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
Well, I think so.
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Hi. Where is everybody?
Oh! Him.
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Excuse me?
Oh. Whew!
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
Really? My God, he's really cute.
Go for it.
I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Hi!
Oh-oh, my God!
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
Ooh, let me talk to him!
Well, can I just...
Shh!! Wait, what?
Alright, go on.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Are you all right?
Y!
What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
I think you're done.
That is wild.
You were in a porno?
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
So what's it shaped like?
Yeah, is there a hair on it?
Joey, this is you!
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Let me see. Oh, right.
When did you go to a sperm bank?
You'll do what?
At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....
Okay, I'll do it.
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.
Oh my God!
Yeah. I guess.
Wow!
Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
Just get your nails done?
Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
Gimme them!
You stole them from me!
You stole them from me!!
You just wanna each take one?
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Me neither.
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
I don't know.
Rachel.
What?!
I get the dollhouse!
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
You get the dollhouse.
Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Come on Ben.
Cool!
Yeah!
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Yeah, there you go!
Bye.
Whoo-hoo!
Second date!
...I dunno.
Are you alone?
Can you just hold on for one minute?
No, you have to let me in right now!!
Yes!
All right.
Are you alright?
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
Okay.
Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
Are you scared?
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Serious?
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Ross will do it.
But the mess!
But my apartment!
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Monica Gellerrr.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Subtle guys!
Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Yeah!
What?!
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Okay, I gotta go.
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
I can't!!
I, but you're so close! No!
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
Who is that?!
Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
Am not!
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
And did he?
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
Rachel's not here.
Hey.
So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Oh.
How's it going with her?
I'm sorry honey.
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
Yeah.
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
Would you stop?
What? I-I said you had a-
What I said you had...
Oh, was I doing it again?
Yes!
What is DOOL?
Hey!
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
Oh!!
Phoebe, what is it?
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Fine.
All right, you know Paolo?
I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Ah, yeah!
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
Mmmm, no.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
Is that all?
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Ohh, how is he?
I have no idea.
Thomas, come back here!
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
Oh, that's nice!
How long?
A couple hours.
Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Excuse me?!
Oh, good. Thanks.
So then you know?
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
Now what is Fabutec?
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Come on! Chandler!
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
They really were pretty, weren't they?
Did you smoke?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Did you two...
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
You did not go!
Oh, Rachel.
Oh come on, I already went.
Come on.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.
Actually, I did!
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Oh God, yes!
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
That is funny.
I can't believe this!
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
Screw it! I'm having one.
Hey Chandler!
This is disgusting!
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
I'm not reading this!
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
Even with me?
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Really?
Ross, can I?
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
I know, I still am one of these.
The head, the head. You gotta...
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Your favorite!
Honey! Dinner's ready!
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Yep! And lot's of it!
Give it to me.
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
No.
Give it to me.
What's going on?
Right.
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
Christmas cookie?
What, that wasn't the great news?
Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Looks good. I'll take it.
Everybody knows!
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Help yourself.
Hey.
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
You okay?
Phoebe moved out.
Hi Ben!
Hi!
Hi!
Auntie Monica!!
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
Hi Mr....Bing.
Hello all!
Hi...dad.
Nora!
Charles.
Hi Steve!
Done.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
This is Rachel.
Still crying?
All the time!
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
So, what's this.
Hi.
Hi darling.
Some of your old stuff.
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
And I have costumes.
Well, the lighting was okay.
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
What are you gonna do Pheebs?
It's good to see you
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Yeah, I'll sit down.
You're table's ready sir.
Oh. Good to see you guys.
Yes, we are.
Really?!
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
Rach...
Oh, that is amazing!
There you go.
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
It's not mayonnaise!!
Okay!!
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
What's this?
Define fun.
You what?
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Which ones?
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
I don't know. The left one.
Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Hey.
What are you crazy?!
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
No, no!
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
Allll done!
Give me that!
Look!
Dude! That's my sister!
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
I wasn't escaping.
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
I love you, too.
You can spill. In the sink.
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
Aww, good. What?
What? I'm just said.
Oh that's so great!
Okay!
Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
I know!
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
Ross isn't here.
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Okay.
Oh. Stop it!
So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
Hey guys! Hey!
No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
The new girl's good.
Hey.
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Noo!! Okay!!
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
Okay!
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
They're green?
What's the game?! What's the game?!
Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
Good! Good! Five points!
All right, Joey, same question.
Oh, good luck.
Good-bye! Good luck!
Hi! Wish me luck!
Good luck. And I'm still right!
That is sooo not true!
Ross, the heat!
Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off.
Did you just break the radiator?
Yes, is that okay?
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Santa? Really?
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
No.
Well it didn't!
Sorry.
Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
What?!
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
No he's not!
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
Yes, he is!
What?!
You are so cute.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
I think you're done.
Are you all right?
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
Okay, time to take off the bra.
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
Say you're sorry.
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
No.
Say it.
How have you been?
Janice?!
Isn't this amazing?
Oh well, I'm divorced.
Ohhh, wow.
It's your birthday!
Happy birthday!!!
Rach! Come on! Rach!
Hey.
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Bing's weird.
No.
Why not?
Oh, hey, you guys!
Hey!
Weird, weird.
Wow.
Freaky.
Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
Who's Denise?
...how about I move in with you?
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
My roommate.
You have a roommate?!
Why, exactly?
What?
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
In the bank.
You were fired? What're you gonna do?
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
Anything larger back there?
I blame London.
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
In a foreign, romantic country...
Bad London!
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
That's my pie!
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
Which smells delicious!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
What?! What is it?
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and-
You brought a carrot.
What?
I am not wrong.
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
You're wrong.
You're wrong.
No, I just talked to them.
What's the charity?
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
Emily Waltham.
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
Yes, what's the name, please?
Yes! I have it right here. Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
Okay.
Something wrong?
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
No. Nothing.
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Sorry, Pheebs.
Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
Yeah. You okay?
Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
They'r alright.
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Are they, uh, firm?
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
No really, they're OK.
What?!! Gross!!
What?! What is it?!
You're gonna have to pee on it.
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
That's not a question.
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
That was unbelievable!
Oh, great!
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
Okay, see? I told you!
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
You could do that!
Thank you, buddy.
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
Y'think?
Yeah!
Is Joey here?
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Wouldn't you be?
What's so funny?
Yeah, okay, bye.
So I'm gonna take off then!
Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
Oh.
Oh, I-I don't know.
Now?
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Monica, what should I do?
Just uh, do the right thing.
I got you a present!
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Huh.
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
I know, but you have to open it today!
you don't have insurance?
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Do you love her?
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ahh.
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
You love her!
Happy birthday!!!
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Happy birthday!!!
Rach! Come on! Rach!
It's your birthday!
You were invited?!
What are you talking about?
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
No.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Hey, what's up?
Or Joseph.
Oh.
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
She's right there.
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
I love you sweetheart.
I'm outa here.
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Aaaahhhhhhh.
Y-ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message? Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK, bye-bye. Hey, who's this uh, this Casey?
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
How's it going?
Hey, Pheebs.
Hey.
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
So what's going on?
He's a dropper!
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
What?
Oh yeah, that's right!
I'm not a dropper!
What's a 'niffle'?
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
That's very nice.
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
That's sweet, Joey.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
You thought about that?
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Yeah.
How many kids were we gonna have?
I'm in the shower!
I know.
Mon?
Oh, fire! There, there's a fire! Fire!!
Hey.
That's not possible!
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Ow!
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Oh... Uh...
I'm fine.
Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I'm blind!
So, who's the lucky guy?
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Oh... shoot.
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
OK.
Poor thing!
Oh they didn't want to come!
Oh Chandler!
So that story doesn't make you cry?
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
Was it...
Oh my God!
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
You ate my sandwich?
Was it...?
Are you sure?
Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
Oooooo....
You'll vamp?!
The wedding starts at six.
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
How can you not remember us kissing?!
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
I don't know Rachel, why?
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Well thanks!
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
That's not gonna work.
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Hey! I didn't know either.
Are you a virgin?
Ethan?
Yeah?
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Really?
Yes it's true.
Monica, is this true?
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
How'd it go?
Oh!... Right!
Hey Rach!
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Not a good day for birds...
Yeah! Oh yes!
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Really?
Ohh.
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
Oh, from who?
Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Yeah.
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
There's only one.
You need one too?
Ooooh yeah.
Monica.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
So are you ok?
Not a dad.
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
Nothing, I don't know.
Hey!
How was the beach?
What happened?
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
Oh, that's great!!
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Joey!
Oh, you weren't finished?
Cat hair.
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
Oh, sorry.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
Ow!! Ow!!!
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Wh-what, why?
Yes, but you are dead inside.
All right well, I'd better take that back.
We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Oh, just do it!!
All right, so what do you say?
No!
Op, op, I'm convinced!
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
You just asked me.
No, you?
No, you?
Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Okay. I am so hot!
To the bank.
Hey.
Where you going?
Sperm or regular?
Sperm.
But they like it!
Hmm?
Stop making candy!
You mean they like you.
Maybe.
That's so gross!
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
I wish I had smoked for my career...
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
What?! What honey?
But...
Oh my God!
What happened?
That was my dad!
That's much better.
Old?
The young hot ball and chain.
Op! We gotta go!
Oh, where are you guys going?
You said the baby.
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
No, the little girl creeps me out.
Why would the baby creep me out?
Why would the little girl creep you out?
What was it for?
Oh! You got it?!
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
The next, next?
Isn't that mine?
How's your room Rach?
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Oh shut up!
Am not!
You're gonna be an aunt.
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
Hi guys!
Then what is it?
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
Wouldn't you be?
Is Joey here?
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Really?
Rachel's at work.
Sorry.
I can hear that!
I can still hear you!
Hey!
Ok, that's enough.
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
I'm afraid so.
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
We're in a relationship?
Okay.
Hey!
No it is not!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
What are you talking...
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Bye Dan!
Yeah, fair enough.
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
Uh, bye Monica.
Bye, momi-moo.
Every year.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Halftime.
Gimme 'em!
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
No! They are mine!
You stole them from me!
Keep talkin'.
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
Oh, yeah!
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
Nope. Schhorry.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Well, then can we meet him?
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
That's my pie!
Which smells delicious!
What?
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Ross will do it.
Are you scared?
No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
I think you look fine.
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Whenever you're ready.
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
He loves you.
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
I think maybe, yeah.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
I'll call you back.
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
You really sure?
So we can be friends who sleep together.
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Hey, I went up.
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
What?
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
Hey! How was it?
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Hey.
Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Aww, thank you.
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!
Allll done!
Okay, who's next?!
No-o-o! No way!
Will you stop!
Gin.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Okay. All right.
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
How about receiving?
Yeah. O-okay.
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
Yes!
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Wow! It's small.
Oy!
See there it is right there.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
So you had fun, huh?
I'm outta here.
Oh!
Ow!
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Really?
No, you're the best.
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
No, you're the best.
No, you're the best.
I am the best.
Yeah. It's Dutch.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Monana?
You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
Phoebe that's crazy!
What?!
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
I made you a surprise.
Hey baby.
Hey.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
I am so jealous.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
Oh!
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
Yes. Right where?
Nah, I got it.
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
Hi!
You made pancakes?
Hey!
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Yep! Grab a plate.
Okay.
We have a baby?
What baby?
Our baby.
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Maye it's me.
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Why do you do it?
Love is the best medicine.
That's laughter.
I don't know.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Chicken Kiev?
Sorry.
Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
G'bye, Nana.
I know.
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
Bye, Nana.
Ross!
Yep, yep...You?
Nope.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
Well...I'd better get going.
She really left.
Bye.
Hey.
I know.
Thank you.
Okay...who are you?
Hi...May I help you?
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
Oh, c'mon in.
Phoebe, Ross sucks!
Why not?
I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
All right. Mmm-mmm.
Ohh.
Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
Yeah?
I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
Let me try.
Hi.
Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
Did I squeeze it too hard?
Ross, don't start.
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
I believe it.
I warned you...
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
Who is being loud?
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Cut it out.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Mi-mi-mii.
I've never wanted you more.
This is my dress!
You came?!
Yeah!
No!
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
Well that's pathetic!
No way!
It's true.
Again true.
And this goes for all guys?
How do you feel?
Hey-ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
What is it hon?
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
I think it's romantic.
Just a smidge.
David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Yeah!
All right, you ready?
You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
You can, I know you can!
It's an expression.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
I'm gonna miss you!
No.
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
I mean it's the end of an era!
I know!
Oh that's so sweet.
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
So we both finished our vows.
Oh!
What?! Excuse me!
This is going in your book?
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
Oh hi!
So then you know?
Oh, there's banana on it.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
Oh, good. Thanks.
How do you do that?
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
You had sex, didn't you?
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
You know Paul?
Yeah, we really do!
You guys make a very attractive couple.
Yeah, we look great together.
Okay.
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Okay. I can do that.
What about your breath?!
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Okay.
Surprise!!!
Oh my God, Richard.
Oh my God!
I know, but just let me say it.
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
What? I'm just said.
I love you, too.
Aww, good. What?
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
So ah, whatcha watching?
I think he's shy.
Shut up!
So, whaddya think George is like?
Yeah?
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Where have you been?
A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
You dated her!
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
No, we only went out once.
Not once!
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
The only problem!
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
What kinda stuff?
Great, now he's waving back.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
You cook naked?
How did it go?
Of course, sir.
Okay.
Had the money in the wrong hand.
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
I'm sorry but...nothing.
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
What?
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
You're doing it again.
Say 200?
200 dollars.
Excuse me.
Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars.
David who?
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Oh my God! That's David!
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
Oh my God!
Emily's straight.
So?
So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
Oh, wake up!
Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Frozen lasagnas?
What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.
Um-hmm.
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
You dont even have cats.
I could have cats.
Well try to keep it down.
Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Ohhhh!! Gross!!
It's okay. How's the soup?
Umm.
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
Is she great or what?
Ready? Wrestle!
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
Oh fine.
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Woo-hoo, geeek!
What's she look like?
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Get out!
Woo-hoo, stuud!
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
I may have.
What's she look like?
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
She said that?!
Wait up!
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
Yeah.
Why?!
You and me both.
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?
Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
Mom, it's OK.
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
Well that's wonderful. . . I
It is Judy.
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
Me and Chandler?!
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Uh-hmm.
You're his bitch.
You realize what you are don't you?
What?
No-no!! No!!
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Hey, what's up?
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
You had no relationship!!
What, forget it!
Hey, what did your agent say?
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
Yeah, right.
Come on, I need your help here.
Yes, it was!
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
What if I asked?
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
It depends on who asked.
Oh, Mon, sure.
Really?
Okay, good luck!
All right.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
Hey!
Really?! You promise?
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Okay. I love you so much.
Give them to me.
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
No.
Alright, we'll share.
No, give me the...
Yeah, am I in it?
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
Sure I do.
Honey, you are in it.
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
I'll be right back.
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Janice is gonna go away now.
Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Whoa.
Aren't you gonna...
But I just wa...
Uh uh.
Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
What about Andre?
Art it is.
Wow Joey, this is, uhh...
Art.
Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
Please, have some!
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Ooh!
Oh, yumm!
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Uh-huh, that one!
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
We're hanging out.
Hey guys! What's up?
Heyyy.
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
How did that happen?
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
That yeti is one smooth talker.
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Rachel, you and Mark?!
Oh no!!
No.
No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
Morning!
That is never good.
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Uff.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Isn't that great?
Hi.
Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
What about the closeness?
What?! Why?!
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
You're on the phone!
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Oh my God! How bad was it?
What did you just say?
Roll-roll!!
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Are you serious?!
And that would be?
Why not?
Because of... the reason.
I, um, can't tell you.
Joey, what's going on?
Between you and...
You just carry that around?
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
What were we thinking?
Stupid.
Totally crazy stupid.
I'm coming over tonight though, right?
Oh yeah. Definitely.
That is not true!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Is someone there?
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Why aren't you home yet?!
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
What are you doing here?
What-what are you doing?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
I won the game.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
It's pretty clear.
Hello Skidmark.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
That's why you broke up with me?
I hate this game!
I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Monica, in or out?
OK Joey, your bet.
Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out.
We're sorry honey.
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
Ohh!
Oh, it's okay.
Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
Phoebe moved out.
Help yourself.
You okay?
Right.
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
I love you too Chandler.
You're-you're what?!
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Dude!
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
What?
Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
Well, uh, I ate some.
Not even close.
I do!
Okay.
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Oh, I love museums!
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
Umm.
Soakin' up all the culture.
How was that possible?
Did not.
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.
Okay.
No she hasn't.
Oh Joey!
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Well, what am I going to say?
Oh, you're a grandpa.
I thought she just had one.
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.
Do you all promise?
Let it go, Ross.
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
You can not do this.
Think it'll work?
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
Do what, do what?
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Oh, this is so great.
I dropped a cup.
...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
Yeah, it was.
All right then. Bye.
Do you not see it?
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
What do you mean?
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
I was always Joanne.
Who's singing?
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
I'm crying here!!
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
What're you gonna do?
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
Step aside, ladies!
Just a small tranquiliser.
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
That's a good idea.
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Yeah!
Do you know what's a bad idea?
We'd love too.
Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
Yeah.
Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
Well hello!
You look great too.
I was probably waiting for it to open.
I gotta tell you, you look great now.
You're an excellent patient!
So how does it look?
Well, what did you do?
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
You're an opthamologist.
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
I'll be right there!
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Oh my god! Where are you?
They're here already? How are they doing this?
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
Like a log.
Hey! How did everybody sleep?
Oh, great.
Us too.
I'm going for a walk.
Like a pirate?!
So how does it look?
Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
If that helps you.
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Oh yeah right!
All right, I guess we should go.
No, wait. Wait.
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
I can't promise anything.
Okay! Ohhh no!
I'm sorry sweetie, it's the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
We're really gonna do this, huh?
Looks like it.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Maybe nobody's tried this.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Oh, c'mon in.
Okay...who are you?
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
Thanks.
Hi, I'm Rachel.
It's not your birthday.
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
And also, my birthday.
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
Hey!
We have a ladle.
The fake kind!
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
Thanks, see you at the party.
Okay, great!
Ross? Let's go.
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
Whoa! Are you okay?
You want some help with that?
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
300 dollars?!
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Okay, fine, $300.
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Urghh!!
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Daaahhhh!
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
I wa-
Bonjour, monsieur.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
I love you!
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Brides magazines?
Gimme this.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
Cache? Jaunty?
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Hey.
Chocolate-chip pancakes!
They do!
Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
We've got presents!
Good ones?
Dead leg!!
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
Oh-ho, okay.
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Woo-yay!!
Edward Nevski?
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Who is it?
Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
No.
Losers walk!
Are you okay?
Come on, let's go!
Yeah, losers talk!
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
Merry Christmas!!
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
Oh! Oh my God!
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Nestle Tollhouse?!
What was her name?
Nesele Toulouse.
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Ow!! Ow!!
Ow!!!
We're all right.
It's okay, it's okay.
Quit flicking
Did you just flick me?
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Ow, you stop flicking.
You flicked me first.
Same category?
Animals dressed as humans.
That's correct. Ladies?
According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
Sixty guests.
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Oh my God! What happened?
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Totally familiar.
Oh well, where is he?!
She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah!
Water rules!
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Monica? Monica!
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Yo- hooo!
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
Where the hell've you been?
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Not any more.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Really?!
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Oh, we have some...
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
No you don't!
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
That's very funny!
Yeah, I didn't think of that.
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
I pick you, Phoebe.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
All right, come here!
Then why did you move?!
Because I knew you were lying!
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
No, no, I don't.
W-wait. What is that?
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
What's wrong Phoebe?
You're not a lefty?
Does anybody know me?!
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Put it out!!
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Come on. I got it.
It's Richard Burke.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Oh, I promise, what.
Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Joey, what are you doing?
I'd love an ice water.
You got it.
Just being friendly.
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
There was nudity!
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Isn't this great?
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Hmm.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
So, did you do it?
What?!
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Uh-oh, it was bad?
And it's a magnet!
This bottle opener.
And?
Look at that!
How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
I'm really not deciding!
Because then I don't have to!
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
Fine!
Excuse me, I-I couldn't help overhearing, you're marrying Chandler Bing?
Well, no. But...
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
What are you doing here?
Hi.
Hi.
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Just...please tell him.
No.
Tell him, tell him.
Shut up!
Tell me what?
Phoebe, what's the matter?
Pheebs!
Fine!
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
We owe you?!
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
We didn't give you any money!
That is so sweet!
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Oh, you look so great.
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Ahh, so do you, beautiful.
Oops.
No time for that!
But my clothes are-ohh!
Wow, you look...
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Well, I've got a girl in here.
You had a salad.
We were shopping, and we had lunch.
Oh, all right. What did I have?
Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Hey, guys, what's up.
No, that's not mine.
No. I hate this part.
Oh, look what we almost left.
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Does so count!
Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count.
Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Oh my God!
There's our star!
No, I'm good.
There he is!
So, so, what'd ya think?
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
You're not a senior?
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Ok...ay.
After the snap!
Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
Before the snap!
After!!
Of course not.
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
No.
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
What are we gonna do?
Do you want some pancakes?
Finally!
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Chandler?
Y'know what's weird?
That's the perfect amount!
Okay!
What?
This doesn't feel weird!
Maybe I could do it.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Yeah, me either.
Hi!
Hi, Rach.
No! I'm not okay!
One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Why would you do that?
What?!
I'm the ruptured spleen.
Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
Really?
Oh, put him on!
What's up?
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
Ok, then just go.
Oh, then go Vassar.
Uh, they're not in it.
Ok.
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
I like them a lot.
I like 'em.
Yeah!
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
We said six!
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
We said seven!
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
It's okay, it's okay.
Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
We're all right.
We're all right.
We were just waxing our legs.
You didn't find her?
Emily?!
Nope, not under here!
No, I've looked everywhere!
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
Joey, you don't have too!
Oh that would be great!
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
How much longer?
Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
A-A day.
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Why do you need it?
Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.
Thanks.
Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!
Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
Hey! There you are!
Really?
Yeah, for you!
There I am!
Are you okay?
You don't have the guts.
What're you gonna do?
You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?
You're not on TV.
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Well, what's the part?
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Oh my God! Whoah!
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
Seriously, what-what's the part?
It's Joey's birthday.
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Oh, God forbid.
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Oh, hi Rachel.
Hi.
Chandler what do you say?
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh...
Was he crying?
You're not just saying that are you?
No, the man is a mess.
No.
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
What-what's going on?
Hey!
Hey!
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
Oh yeah? When?
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
You'll get one.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Shut up, Joey!
Yeah?
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
It's gonna be so great.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
Hi! What's going on?
Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
This was your idea?
What?
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
What were you thinking?
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
Come on, hurry!
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
Why?
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
What? Honey.
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
I know.
Ow!!
Sometimes we were.
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait!
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Nice try.
Look, Monica...
Look!
Great!! That's great!
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Because it's my apartment!
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
How about, you're moving!!
Where ya going?
Yes!
Yeah, he likes porn.
I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
Hey.
Don't come in here!
Probably around gonorrhea.
Hi, honey! I'm home!
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
No! We only mess around at his place!
I know honey, I'm sorry.
I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
"See you around?"
So. I guess I'll see you around.
What, that's it?
Well, what do you want me to say?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
Weren't you nine?!
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
Here's your key
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Okay.
Oh thanks.
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
That is so unfair!
You guys, I am not that bad!
Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Well put it back.
Did you just break the radiator?
No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
It uhh, it won't go back.
I'll call the super.
What?! What is it?!
We've got to do something!
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
You're gonna have to pee on it.
What?!! Gross!!
They're nice guys.
Oh, my god.
See, there you go, the cleansing works!
Oh, they're firemen guys.
You guys tell them you were married?
And you're cute too.
That's okay.
And I'm cute too.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Okay.
What's with the guitar?
Did I miss it, did I miss it?
She's not even here yet.
I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
Where the hell have you been?
Here you go sweetie.
Hey, how's it going?
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
But, I put some honey in it.
Not any more!
Hi, this is Richard.
You have three new messages.
Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
Mom, I'm hungry.
See, he's her lobster.
Dance with him.
Dance with your father.
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
I'm not talking to her!
Well that's a full cup!
Damn! I am good at Cups!
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
Make a wish?
Oh, I will.
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
The bigger half.
I know it is the best.
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
What? It's still going on.
Why is it sick?
He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
I know, it's sick.
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
Where's your bed?
Pheebs?
Huh?
It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
What?
You need one too?
I know. I just can't find...
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
Ooooh yeah.
There's only one.
That other play?
That play?
No!
Nooo!
The movie?
I don't want a beer.
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
Monica, relax, go get a beer.
Who said it was for you?
Hhhiiii.
I don't want a cat!
What?!
Oh yeah, I got a cat.
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Yeah.
I don't want a ghost.
And is this in case the house sneezes?
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Oh yeah. Definitely.
What were we thinking?
I'm coming over tonight though, right?
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...
I, Emily...
And Monica knows...
Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Do you have a plan?
Phoebe?
What?
I don't even have a 'pl'.
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
My brother, Ross.
Hey!
Hi, Joey.
Hey.
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Ross, there he is.
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.....
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...
Well, what's the job?
Oh, Rachel!
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
You sold me out.
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
That is the most ridiculous.
I did not sell you out.
Yes you did. Absolutely.
That you're a liar.
Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Yeah.
No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Oh, that's too bad.
I'm sorry.
No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
I'll survive.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
Here we go again.
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
I-I can't handle this, you guys.
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
You're going to China?
I'm going to China.
Jeez, you say one thing, and...
Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
Oh, let me see!
They were lovers.
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
It's not a big deal!
What?!
What?!
Ross, that is gorgeous!
Cute.
I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
Yeah?
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
What d'you think?
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
Lotsa things.
Which one do you think she is?
It's Fun Bobby.
Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
What's the matter?
What, isn't he sober?
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Because they made me.
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
Why?
You were fired? What're you gonna do?
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
Oh God! I gotta go!
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
Okay. Here's the thing.
Easy Lenny.
So? I mean have you thought about it?
Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What's the thing?
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
He took off?
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Go on! Go on.
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
I'm, I'm really sorry.
I understand.
Wow.
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
Relieved?
What about your breath?!
Okay. I love you so much.
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Okay. I can do that.
He is so amazing.
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
Oh, I know. Look at him.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
What's goin' on?
You go get that animal outta here.
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Oh.
You have other friends?
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
What?
What was her name?
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
Nesele Toulouse.
Nestle Tollhouse?!
Dad, I'm the twinkie.
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
You're the twinkie?
She's not a twinkie.
That was me and Ross.
What's wrong with this year?
Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
Oh that's right!
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
All right, I'm outta here!
Hi Rachel!
Hey!
Wow, is that Michelle?
It's OK, it's fine.
KARL!
Yep.
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
What? I don't see anything.
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
Ross, whose glasses are those?
What are you up too?
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, Big Brother.
Aww! I love you!
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
Happy plane-aversary.
Can I give you a present now?
Okay!
Kinda. Oh my God!
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
Hey!
He could hear me.
Oh, yeah.
What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
We're not doing anything.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
You're doing it again.
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
You don't have birds.
I don't think there's anything.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
Come on, there's gotta be something.
Nope, she's perfect.
I hope she's OK.
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
No, nothin'.
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
How do you know exactly what she's going through?
I can't go to lunch!!
What?!
Let's go to lunch.
Right.
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
Okay, this one I like!
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Honey, we gotta go!
I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
Rachel always cries!
I told you not to go down there!
Well he made Rachel cry!
That's not true!
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
Joey that is horriable.
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
No, I'm-I'm serious!
You stink!
Thanks!
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Hate that guy!
You're welcome.
Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
Night, you guys.
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Mmmm! It's good!
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Well?
Really? How good?
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
What are you talking about?
What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
But you guys came so close.
I love you, Pete!!!
Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
Oh! You're awake!
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
Alright, whadyou do with him?
Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
I'll get it.
Youre doing it again.
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
Well, it's getting late.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
You are just the sweetest.
Oh, the mixed tape.
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
No! You're the sweetest!
Joey, you had the night!
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!
What?
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Oh, this is so hard.
I'm a twinkie.
Really? I'm a hero.
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
Phoebe, wait a minute!
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
I'm an assistant buyer!!
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
I just... can't do it.
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
Boys? We're going in.
.....Hi.
Over here dad.
Oh yeah we do. C'mon.
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Some girl ate Monica.
Oh, I already have one.
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
I'm so happy for me.
I wanna wear this everyday.
You look so beautiful.
Hello?
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
So we're back on?
Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
You're right. Of course you're right.
We're back on.
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
You keep saying that.
Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Wow!
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
You're meeting Richard?
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
Could you not look?
Well...I'd better get going.
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
I don't want to look.
Hello?
I guess that's how.
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
Monica?
Hey Monica, how's it going.
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
No no no no.
Oh, no no no no no.
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
Impressive.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
What?! What are you doing?!
I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
Do you know what just happened?
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Would you please go?
Please, I'm not going for anything.
Well, if you don't, I will.
Night Mon. Night Julio.
Adios.
We'll talk later.
Stop!
No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
Yeah. Thank you.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Really?! How much?!
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Hi, come on in.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Okay, coming!
Hey.
Hi, Geoffrey.
I know! I know! I know!
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
Monica, you asked the question.
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Aww, not right now.
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Oh, but that's okay.
I know.
Honey, what's the matter?
Oh, thank you.
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
I just saw Janice.
Oh.
Hey. Where's Joey?
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
I think he's across the hall.
We had a characturist!
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
Oh!!
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
How ya feelin'?
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Yeah, Ginger something.
No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Oooh.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Hide the Lamp.
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
What?
Monica, let it go.
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
Watch the thorns!
I know I couldn't. So....
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
Ow!!
What?
You don't have any stuff.
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Well, what about my stuff?
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
No.
So how was Joan?
That's not bad.
Hey.
I broke up with her.
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Yeah. Where were you?
Hey!
Oh, is the play over?
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
I think you're my favorite.
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Right!
Which one do you have?
I don't care.
What if they don't?
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
You think I need a new walk?
What?
There's my little boy.
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
There we go. All better.
Can I uh see something?
Cool.
Shh!! Wait, what?
Oh-oh, my God!
Well, can I just...
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
And six others.
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
And?
There you are.
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
I can't believe you did that.
Which one? Which button, Jack.
The button, the button.
Yeah, well.
See, he's her lobster.
Joey, do you work here?
Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
No.
Hey, waiter.
How did work go?
You're kid's name is Raymond!
Yeah?! So's yours!
Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
You stink!
What the hell is this?
You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
We both do that!
I used to wet my bed.
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Don't worry about it.
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
That's totally understandable.
So we can go out again?
Oh yeah!
Are you still awake?
Fine.
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Yeah! You?
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Hey. Whaddya doing?
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Chandler, what are you doing?
Oh! Oh, God!
What is this?!
No! You have lasagnas!
I don't get it.
No, I have faith...
Ding!
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
Hmm, bite me.
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
Well, they always called.
Did he call?
No. Sorry.
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
No-no, I bought those.
Yeah.
That you're a liar.
Have you seen Chandler?
I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
I know! It's awful. I love you.
No. Why?
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Well, thanks anyway.
So what'd he say?
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
What did you tell them?
Ewww! And "Oh no!" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
Huh.
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Sorry we're late.
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
It's James Bond.
Ah, that's OK, come on in. Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
I'm really gonna miss you.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Okay.
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
Thanks.
I totally forgive you!
Well you did a little bit.
Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
Really?
Yes!
Hey, what's going on?
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Man alive!
Hey!
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
No. No, thank you!
Hey!
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
I'm so happy for you!
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
Yeah!
Well, these really are the days of our lives.
What?!
Are you okay, sweetie?
Hi.
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Cookie?
Ohh, how is he?
Is that all?
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Isn't he an architect now?
Oh, that'd be great.
So, I'll get-get back to my friend.
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
Okay!
Thanks.
Why would we do that?
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
I don't know why I'm here.
Hi.
Hi.
I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
I don't know.
Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Nestle Tollhouse?!
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Yes!! Ohh.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Umm, well, he's...
How do ya do.
What's...
He's doin' some thinkin'!
What happened? What happened?!
Okay, I'm not getting this!
She could be you.
Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
I'm totally getting it!
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
It doesn't say that!
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
What's going on with you?
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
I got no sleep last night!
Why?
I mean, was it Gina?
How can you not know which one?
I mean that's unbelievable.
Which one is Gina?
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
Oh, that's sounds great.
So, where do you want to go?
Hey, you like pizza?
I know a great little place.
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
Phoebe, that stuff is...
Oh Pheebs.
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
Don't even get me started on yours!
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
No, give me the...
Give them to me.
Alright, we'll share.
Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
That's it! Dinner is over!
The head tilt?
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
I'm sorry.
Ohh that's sweet!
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Oh my God!
What have I not told you?
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
What!
Uh, wait, backstage?
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
Ross.
Are you mocking me?
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
Hey, what's up?
Thanks. I think you got it!
What are you doing?!
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Well, like father, like son.
Hey umm, what's this?
Glow-pop giggly jammer.
You make it so funny.
Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp.
Oh my God! What happened?
Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
So, how was your date?
Joey, what's going on?
And that would be?
I, um, can't tell you.
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
About what?
Why is Ross naked?
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Why does anyone have to be naked?
I-I had to show Chandler something?
Naked?
I think I need a drink.
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
Yeah!
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
'Kay, here you go.
So Pheebs what's this guy like?
Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
What is this?
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Run, Phoebe, run!
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Pheebs, run!
Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
Wow, this really sucks.
So maybe we should just. . .
Yeah, yeah, maybe.
Yeah, it sure does.
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
What's the big deal?
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Where are you going?
You have to go to London!
You put your fist through the wall?
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
What?
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Ohh that's sweet!
I don't have an atlas.
Where's that?
In your atlas!
Oh.
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
You bought a boat?
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Okay, I bought a boat.
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Don't you have to pee?
Do you?
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
'S'why I'm dancing...
Mindy.
Joey that is so sweet.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Hey.
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
Hey! I didn't know either.
That's not gonna work.
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Yeah, I knew.
You know what? You're right.
Well, I guess now we can't go.
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
Fine.
Fine.
Then what's the problem?
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
I did do it, I'm a professional.
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
Oh, honey, the earrings...
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Let me see the earrings.
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Ah well, this is the living room.
Impressive.
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
You're a dork.
I can't believe this.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Anything but stew.
Okay, can we please go eat?
Yeah. What are we getting?
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
My surprise party!
You'd better act surprised.
About what?
What surprise party?
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
W-wait. What is that?
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
Oooh!
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
No, no, I don't.
I gave you one job!
You didn't.
Oh, I am sorry...
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
Okay. I love you so much.
Really?! You promise?
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
What about your breath?!
All right, you're hired!
That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Good enough to get fired.
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Yes.
Well Rachel's not here!
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Rachel said that!
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
Give me the good stuff.
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Still no luck.
You really think this is okay?
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
My Giant? I love that movie!
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Can you blame him?
All right, what about the third guy?
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
Well then we still have a problem.
What? We could do it!
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
The oven is on.
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Do either of you have the keys?
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
The fake kind!
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
We have a ladle.
Wait! What about Joey?
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Hi...May I help you?
Get off!
Hi.
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
Okay...who are you?
...I can imagine.
That sounds like Nana.
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
What?! Which one?!
Joey!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
What happened to Janine?
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
Oh that's too bad.
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Oh-ho, and mine!
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
God, you are so strong.
So! He'll understand!
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Oh my God! That is so good!
Are you through with that?
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
...Then I've already seen this one!
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Oh, then go Vassar.
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
Uh, it's the college playoffs.
Uh, they're not in it.
Ok, then just go.
One two three.
Rock-paper-scissors?
Yeah.
Yeesss.
Fine, go have sex.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
I know! I know! I know!
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Uh... yay!
Thanks!
Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Light still out?
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
Yeah.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
In like a half-hour?
I'm changing out of this.
Me too.
Me too.
Okay, throw it straight this time.
I saved you a seat.
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
Sick-sick-sick-sick.
Oh, I'll get it.
What the hell happened?!
No ma'am.
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
You had no relationship!!
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Are these the shoes?
What'd I say?
Hm-m.
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Chandler, what were you thinking?
What?!
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
Chandler?
It's good to see you too.
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
It's good to see you.
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice.
Happy birthday dad.
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
Oh thank you.
Hi ma.
Okay. I-I can't watch.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Yeah, I-I don't care.
What 'cha readin'?
The paper.
Okay! Ohhh no!
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
Ohh! Didn't know! Okay!
I'm sorry sweetie, it's the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
I can't promise anything.
Can we come in?
Hi.
Hey.
I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Susan, he looks just like you.
No! You can't do that!
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat.
Maybe I should go!
Sit down! We're winning!
Lots of responses.
Hey.
Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?
: Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me.
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
I was frustrated with you!
I was frustrated.
It was my racquet.
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
I lost our mattresses.
That's right! You do what the hand says!
How did it go?
"Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
Hey!
Damn! It's empty!
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Monica! Stop it!
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Thank you so much Phoebe.
Ughh!
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
Sure.
What are you doing with those?!
Fine, go have sex.
One two three.
Yeesss.
No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
Another good point.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Huh?
Okay, well I do know you.
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
Yeah.
That's what I said.
Well so?
I never knew that either.
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
I didn't know that.
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
Hey guys! What's up?
Yeah, no, me neither.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
You still want to move in together right?
Hey! How was sailing?
That and arrogance.
Hey.
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Alright, we have to talk.
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
There it is!
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
What is going on with you?
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
What?! Why?!
Nothing!
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
What can we do for you?
Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
Well, what about his family?
Are we still on that?
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
'I am Bea.'
Oh please God, let there be a song.
There was no song. There was no song!
Okay.
'I drink tea.'
Joey, promise me something.
Wha-, you have a phone in here?
That's right, I have a phone in here.
Yeah.
Never call me from that phone.
Hey, where is everybody?
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Rach? What are you doing?
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
It's a diaper commercial.
All right then. Bye.
Oh, this is so great.
Yeah, it was.
Hello, people who do not live here.
Hi! Hello!
What kind of changes?
You!
It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
Hey!
Well, you're-you're sweating.
Are you okay?
Uh-huh.
These-these are beads of joy.
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
Anybody lose this?
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
Hmm.
Eldad, this is Rachel.
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
What?
How are you?
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
This bottle opener.
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
And?
And it's a magnet!
Oh May 15th.
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
So when are you getting married?
Oooh it's getting close!
Yeah!
Rachel, that's all we do.
Me too, we should get goin'.
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
What about Julie?
It's like two miles!
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
He doesn't have anyone.
I know.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
What? I didn't say anything.
All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
All right, that's it, I quit.
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
That's not even a game!
Uhh, they're tall.
Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
What? Shut up! We're winning!
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
Oh no, wait! Joey!
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
All right, I'll take care of it.
73! 72! 71!
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
No, I really, really do.
I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
You don't wanna know.
Well, he's doing terrible!
Really!
You're Lewis Posin.
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Who?
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
I know, it is isn't it?
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
Umm, this is nice.
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Huh, wanna bet?
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
How about we play for more money, say 150?
What are you guys gonna do?
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
I'd do anything for you.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
Oh my-Oh good God!
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Baking it didn't help, huh?
Give it. Give it.
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
Okay.
Oh!!
I do not like that woman!
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Okay.
I can hear you!
I am loud!
Uh-oh, it was bad?
So, did you do it?
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
So what're you gonna do?
Well, how did you find out?
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
Well, I can't work with people who would do this.
Sure.
I am. I'm that stupid.
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
You're that stupid.
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
How did you get in here?
Oh, hello Rachel.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
Your sister Joan is crazy.
What's Phase Two?
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
How does going to a strip club help him better?
Oh my God! I love that!
Uh-hmm.
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
Really?!
Uh, no!!
Honey, there's a reason.
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
You'd better run!
That's it big girl! Come on!
Wait!
Did you hear that?
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
And you're not gonna do that.
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
So-so there is no party.
Not now, I'm sick!
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Oh come on you big faker!
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Where were your parents?
All right, what's going on there?
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
Oh they didn't want to come!
Oh Chandler!
Okay, okay. I hate this.
That's insurance fraud.
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
What did they do to you?
Y'okay, Phoebe?
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
Easy.
How-how did that happen?
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Uh-oh...
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
Go! Go! Go!
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Hey...
NOW!!!!!!!!
Would you just open it?
No, here's your mail.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
We all chipped in.
I bet this will work!
Look!
This is not going to work.
You are so great! I love you!
What?
That's Bill Clinton.
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
Who's he huggin'?
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
Maureen Rosilla.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
You're doing it again.
We're not doing anything.
I'll take care of it.
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand.
That's right! You do what the hand says!
How did it go?
Mine? Right here?
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
Hey, have you seen Rachel?
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
No, why?
I have some pretty exciting news!
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
Nothing! It's an expression.
No it's not.
Yes, you are so smart!
Dark red.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Aww, you guys are so cute!
I know.
Okay. That was her right?
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Hola! Hello. Hello?
Definitely.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
I-I-I think you look great.
Oh well, no I...
Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
I'll get her.
Oh, she's gonna love that!
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
I don't have anything.
Have you seen Chandler?!
Phoebe!
Yeah?
No! Why?
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
I can't! I have to work!
I don't know sweetie.
No! Help me!
Phoebe?
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
Do you have any tissues?
Okay!
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
Chandler is such an idiot!
Drink?
...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Still smoking cigars?
Nope, she's perfect.
I don't think there's anything.
Come on, there's gotta be something.
I have one.
Good! Great! You can go first.
Good for you, Joey.
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
I couldn't do it.
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Ooh, and I can do this.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
I know, I can do this.
We can't do that.
Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
He asked you out?!
JOEY!!!!!!
You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Saucy!
I love this friend thing!
Yeah, right.
Hello.
Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
Oh.
Are you guys gonna be okay?
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Oh, yeah! Right!
Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
I understand.
Oh my God! I love him!
About what?
He's planning your birthday party.
You'd better act surprised.
About what?
You don't even know me...
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
What?
All right, be my guest.
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
Good luck.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Well, look at that, same thing.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Oh, hello Rachel.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
Thank you soo, much.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
You want some help with that?
Oh my god good?
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
Oh my god.
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
He hates to lose.
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Yeah.
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
You're not a lefty?
Man's got a point.
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Crazy bitch.
Yes you did. Absolutely.
You sold me out.
I did not sell you out.
Would you let me talk.
Did you just flick me?
You flicked me first.
Quit flicking
Ow, you stop flicking.
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Um... hi there.
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
I'm just easing you in.
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Oh, well that's not so crazy.
Oh, alright.
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
I need to get some Richard.
God, what is wrong with me.
You need to get some sleep.
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
He's... our age.
Thank you.
How young is young Ethan? Young?
When we were?
Okay, he's a senior in college.
Y'know, I never saw that.
My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
Ooh, it was only okay.
Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!
Uh-oh, what's the matter?
Hey!
Hey, Monica!
Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?
I don't know sweetie.
Oh boy me too!
Hey!
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Yeah?
A couple of days.
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
What's this? Blue nail polish?
Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
Let me ask you a question.
No, she's out shopping.
Hey.
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Damn!
What's going on?
You're not supposed to look!
No, our guy is just a floating head.
Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
No, none at all.
Yes!!
You have no idea who I am, do you.
None.
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
No, I will not cave.
Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
Yeah, I'm with Mon.
Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas.
I know. I just can't find...
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
Oh my God, honey that's great.
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
You need one too?
And his puppet too.
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
Who?
Them?! Who's them?
Phoebe knows about us!
Well I didn't tell them!
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Joey!
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Does it matter?!
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Give me the good stuff.
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
Okay.
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
What took you so long?
Well...
Get out!
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Oh, good.
Waaay too special.
Nah... not-not special enough.
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
I am famished. What do I want...
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Hey, I know I what I want!
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
What we want honey.
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
What was the dream about?
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
Well, get it off now!
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
I can't! It-it's stuck!
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
I'm not your best friend?
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
Well, Joey's my best friend.
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
How's it going with her?
Rachel's not here.
Oh.
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
You used to have carpet.
Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
I don't know, it looks the same.
Oh yeah!
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
Joey, speed it up!
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
So what'd he say?
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
No one was around to hear that?
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
Well, thanks anyway.
Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
Hi.
Hey.
All right all ready.
Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
Oh and you know what I want!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
I do not have baby fever!
What's hard to believe?
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
So, how'd it go?
Might wanna open with the snowman.
Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
So what are you gonna be?
How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Shut up, I'm happy.
Well, maybe you don't need them.
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
Very good, so good.
Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
That's insurance fraud.
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
Okay, okay. I hate this.
Oh, why is it unfair?
It's worse than the thumb!
Hey, this is so unfair!
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
You're kidding?! That's great!
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
Ohhhhh!
Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
Oh my.
And who laminated it?
Ooh, very official.
Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
That would be me.
All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
No, here's your mail.
Rach, here's your mail.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Would you just open it?
Eh, you work for that.
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Ehh.
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
You do?!
Yeah, thanks. You know what?
Then I won't have to kill you.
So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
What?
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
I'm getting married next!!
Okay, throw it straight this time.
Okay.
Yay!
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
God Ross, what is that?
There you go.
Hey!
Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
You didn't know that already?
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Well, uh, he's a doctor.
Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
So, who's the mystery man?
A real doctor?
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
Why is everything different?
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Uh-huh
Bye!
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
How does she do that?
Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
I cannot sleep in a public place.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
I really need to talk to you.
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
No.
Well, then talk!
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Why do I have to decide?
Monica!
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Because you're the only one that can be fair.
Yeah.
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
No we didn't!
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Okay, here's your penis!
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Oh, you bet I am!
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
But my clothes are-ohh!
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
Wow, you look...
No time for that!
We won't. 300?
Excuse me.
Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars.
Monica?!
I'm just trying to spice it up!
Are you sure this time?
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's.
Well no, but um.
Uh-huh.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
What is it hon?
I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Ross didn't scare you?
You still want to move in together right?
Of course!
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Come here, I want to show you something!
Guys, what's going on?
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Sort of...
Phoebe's a porn star!
What?!!
Well what did you send?
That new mountain bike?
No.
A basket of mini-muffins.
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Did that!
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Was it not pain-free?
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Would you look at them?
You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
Yeah, can't help but.
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
Okay, umm, you're a loon.
What?!
Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.
Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
I don't know.
Did you just flick me?
Yes you did. Absolutely.
Would you let me talk.
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Quit flicking
Why would I have the keys?
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
But I didn't.
Here, let me try.
It uhh, it won't go back.
I'll call the super.
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
So what's Phoebe like?
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
Noo!!
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
No, I haven't seen him.
Did you go home and change?
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
Just waiting for you sweetie.
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
What're you doing?
Are you remaking the bed?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
What? It's still going on.
I know it is the best.
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Hey! How's it goin'?
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes it has! I made cookies!
We're switching rooms.
Come here. Okay, be right back.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
How are you still single?!
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Oh, I can still do that.
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Good. What made you change your mind?
You have dinosaur checks?
That's what they'll call us.
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Why don't you just call her?
Why don't you just take it with you?
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Do you?
I can't believe he did this.
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
Ooh, this always happens.
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Here, let me help.
Thank you.
So I'm kissing everyone?
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
I can't kiss anyone.
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Hey! Don't be a baby!
Here he comes! Hurry!
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
Well I...
Let's go!!
I mean really, think about it.
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
Ho-ho, I will.
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
I can't believe you bought this.
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
Yeah, well, is that better?
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
It's creamier.
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
My God! What happened to you?
You have got to go home!
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Okay.
But I like it here!
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Who are you talking too?
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Why?! What happened?!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Fine with me!
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
No it is not!
Happy New Year.
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year, Pheebs!
You too!
No. I hate this part.
Oh, is everything in the car?
Yes. Did you settle the bill?
Oh, look what we almost left.
No, that's not mine.
No, I just talked to them.
I am not wrong.
You're wrong.
I'm calling Mom.
Hey, hey.
I mean don't you trust her?
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
No.
Well, yeah!
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Oh, here's a great one.
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
Yeah, I'm not in that.
I know, but look at me all tan.
Know when to stop.
I think you're better than you think you are.
Really? Okay, so...
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
What the hell are you doing?!
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Well you should be embarrassed.
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
I did, but that was really fun.
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Okay.
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Yeah, she's...
But we can go, right?
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Yes.
Okay!
Well, apparently she does.
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Hey! What's going on?
I thought she just had one.
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
Ya know, she's having another baby.
No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
Oh, you're a grandpa.
How who wears it?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Demi Moore.
Demi Moore is not a he.
He took my snack!
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Well you did pull his hair.
I'm not getting into this again!
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
What are you guys doing here?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Oh...
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
...What did I ask?
That sounds like Nana.
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
...I can imagine.
This is so much fun!
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Absolutely! Absolutely!
This is not fun!
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Regular or decaf?
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
Ah, which ever is closest.
Okay.
Rachel, how did this happen?
Ewww!
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Where?
What happened to your teeth.
What's up?
You know...Oh My God.
I whitened them.
Really.
Come on, no peeking!
All right, get a room.
Okay!
Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Okayyyyy, open up!
Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Yeah that dog left!
There's no dog in here.
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
Sure! Okay, you go first.
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Okay, come here! Come here.
Okay!
The best man? Wow!
Jeffery.
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
OK, then get me your purse.
OK, here you go. Good luck.
Ok, here, watch this.
Alright, you wanna feel better?
Yeah.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
I don't think there's anything.
Alright, alright, alright...
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
For what?
Oh.... my... God.
Oh yeah. See you guys.
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
It's not that bad.
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
Not at these prices.
I know!
Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
No that's, that's okay.
Still smoking cigars?
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
So do them for free.
What's the matter?
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
They make you take an oath?
What are you trying on now?
Toothpick?
Yeah.
The fruit roll up.
And?
I am, aren't I?
Okay.
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
Ms. Waltham?
Yes?
Oh, an old glove?
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Nu-uh!
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
You really ok with it?
Well yeah.
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
Oh honey, I'm fine.
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
...What did I ask?
What are you guys doing here?
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Hi.
Hi.
In...in two weeks.
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
We all chipped in.
Would you just open it?
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
We did?
You owe me 20 bucks.
Oh my God it's old!
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
It's an old key!
I love you!
I love you!
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
Yeah. It's Dutch.
You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
Hi.
Wow! You are really fast!
Hm-hmm!
Okay!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
We're gonna see each other naked.
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Thanks.
Where is she?
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
Oh no! What's the matter?
Hey.
Hey.
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
Rach, here's your mail.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
No, here's your mail.
I'm gonna start getting ready!
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
I'm changing out of this.
This isn't even my dress.
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
Me too.
In like a half-hour?
What's fish hooking?
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
What's wrong with PBS?
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Ugh, PBS!
Ugh, what's right with them?
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
No really, they're OK.
They'r alright.
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
You gonna slice them up real nice?
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Pheebs, how's it going?
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Ugh!
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
What is the worse part?
Why, what happened?
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
I can't remember which sister.
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
All right, check me out.
Really? Your work laugh?
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
Okay.
...says $30 Father; same as in town.
No. See you don't understand.
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
No come on. Come on tell me.
Come on.
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
Why did you hire me?
Let me ask you a question.
Hmm.
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Hey, it's good to see you!
Monica! Chandler!
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Y'know what? You are right?!
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
It's so good, isn't it?
All right, then massage me up right nice!
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Barry who you almost...?
What is it?
Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Barry who I almost.
And Mindy, your maid of...?
Thank you. They're yours.
Oh, I think so.
Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Actually they were Nana's.
Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
They've arrested Monica.
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
What?
Hi.
Hey.
OK, um. Goodbye.
You too.
You too.
Drops!
What?
Worked like a charm.
Okay, if you really wanna have sex...
Okay!
Hi!
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Well, maybe you don't need them.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
I don't know, I don't have my jammies.
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Shut up, I'm happy.
And he's a great brother!
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
I had a sister.
Ohh!
So, are you ready to go?
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you too.
Yeah.
Chandler!
Well, what about his family?
What can we do for you?
All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
He didn't have any.
Ok, so let's talk money.
Put your head back.
Sit down.
All right.
Yes!
All right.
And that's Pete's Mom.
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Hello.
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
I am not high maintenance!
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
That's great. Good for you guys.
I am not a pushover!
Who said you were?
Oh, god help us.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
What?
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
Oh my God.
Gotta keep squishing.
Oops.
Okay.
Tomatoes are squishing.
Okay.
Ah, the other Jack.
...Jack from downstairs?
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
Well, thanks, we like him.
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.
There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
It's a diaper commercial.
Rach? What are you doing?
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Pizza delivery!
Or incredibly offensive.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
Oh yeah, sure, that too.
What?
This is all of your things.
What is that?
Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
That can't be your father.
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and...
Gay!
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
What?
What's with all this sand?
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Oy!!
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Eh! Stop it!
Hey!
Hey!
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Hey! Hi!
Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
Okay great!
You're a really good kisser.
This doesn't feel weird!
I know.
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
Hm-hmm!
Well you did a little bit.
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
I totally forgive you!
Ow. Ow. Ow.
You flicked me first.
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Thunder being stolen!!
It was just a kiss.
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Monica...
Will you marry me?
Oh-no. No. No.
Now, open your eyes.
All right.
Okay.
Okay, they are.
How many fingers am I holding up?
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
Well, didn't you?
I might have.
Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
What have I not told you?
This doesn't feel weird!
Y'know what's weird?
What?
I know.
You're a really good kisser.
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Absolutely not.
Probably just the first half.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
Was it really that good?
Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
I got you the foot massager.
So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
Well, actually it's just from me.
You know who shaved you? That was me.
I read to you.
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
So how do you kids like your coffee?
Just a little bit of sugar.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
Who the hell are you?!
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
I'm Joey! How are you doin'?!
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
I'm not gonna go out with him.
There you go!!
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
Or incredibly offensive.
Yeah, but without the costumes.
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
Oh?!
Oh.
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
Okay, what's going on with you?
Okay. Umm...
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Nothing! You go!
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
I thought that was a good thing.
What?
One of the babies is kicking.
It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don't make me come in there!
Hey!
Hey! Good, you're home!
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Hey.
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Hey baby.
Yes! Have you seen it?
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Waxine!!
Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
I know!!
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
It's 9:30 in the morning!
They got a breakfast buffet.
Ooh, let me talk to him!
Oh-oh, my God!
Can I ask you a question?
Thank you.
No problem roomie.
Sure!
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
I wanna wear this everyday.
Here comes the bride.
Oh my God Monica!
You look so beautiful.
I'm so happy for me.
I'm so glad you liked it.
It's so good. Oh, thanks.
Good.
Oh!
What?!
So you had fun, huh?
Wow! It's small.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.
No.
Why, how much is that?
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that.
That's about 60 cents.
Every night!!
Rachel locked the door.
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Havin' some trouble?
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
How about Mockolate mousse?
Really?
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
That doesn't seem fair.
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
Yeah, it is the best.
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
My brother, Ross.
Hey.
How do ya do.
What's...
Then why are you laughing?
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
I'm not freaking out.
It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
Then why are you smoking?
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Well it's very unsettling.
....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
There were only twelve.
Staying out of the way.
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
Oh yeah, I added three.
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Bye sweetie, I love you.
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
Bye, Richard.
I love you, too.
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
God, what is wrong with me.
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
You need to get some sleep.
I need to get some Richard.
Oh, wait a minute honey.
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
Phoebs.
Wow.
Does anybody want these?
Well we... we kinda broke up.
Awwwwwwww.
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Hey.
You did a minute ago!
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
I don't speak English.
Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
Fine!
Come on Rach, let's go.
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
It's Monica, open up!
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
Who is it?
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Oww!
Wow! You made a profit!
Did you get your money back?
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
Oh yeah, there you go.
Oh my God, you're a freak.
Alright, go on.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
Yeah. How 'bout that.
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
Yeah, that's a big step.
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
I know...
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Well, you're not working either.
Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
Yes, but I'm doing this.
Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
Hey!
What gave me away?
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
It's almost our anniversary!
On a totally different bet.
Hey!
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Hey! You're wearing pants!
Honey, that's you're name.
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
It's 9:30 in the morning!
Hi, nice to meet you!
Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
Nice to meet you Monica. Bing!
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
What?
Well, bye for me too.
OK, well, bye.
Goodbye.
OK, well, bye-bye again.
OK.
I would love to do it together!
Done.
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
They're gonna do it together.
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
I highly doubt that.
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Hey, Rach, how was work?
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
Hey!
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
How was your first day?
Hey!
Hey!
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
What is wrong with you?!!!
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Aww, I love you so...
What?!
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
It's very interesting, Phoebe.
Hey, what's this?!
Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
What's this?
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
Where do you want to start?
Soakin' up all the culture.
Yeah.
Ooh, the gift shop!
Yeah!
Ross, thats my jacket.
Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
I know.
Hi, were the Rostins. Err, Im J.C., and hes Michael, and were having a boy, and a girl.
We're with you. We got it.
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Chandler, what are you doing?
'I drink tea.'
'I am Bea.'
Okay.
Okay, that's, that's enough.
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
See he's nice. Right?
Thank you.
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
Y'know, just be there for her.
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
What do you mean?
Not following you.
Think about it.
Well, I was having a conversation.
Oh, really.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
None.
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
What?!
How'd the lecture go?
Hey!
Hey!
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
Chandler, why are you doing this?
What a bad idea!
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Chandler.
No, just a Friday night.
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Ohh, these are pretty good.
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Let's get the show on it!
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Hey!
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
Awww. But still no.
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
I never stop thinking about it.
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
Look at you. All jealous.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more
beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .
Okay, it's ready. Come on.
So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
What's ready?
Just come.
This is my favorite part.
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Yeah do it now, call right now.
Yeah me too.
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Well, what am I going to say?
No she hasn't.
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
Alright, you wanna feel better?
Charlotte who?
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
Yeah.
Ok, here, watch this.
Oh, now you want a pad.
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Hey!!
There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Is it the Italian guy?
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
You betcha!
Um-mm, yeah right!
He's so cute.
Honey! Dinner's ready!
Yeah baby!
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Your favorite!
I'll pick it up for you!
Already?!
Yeah, but it didn't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress...
Thank you.
Okay.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
Nooo!!
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
God!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
What are you doing with those?!
Thank you so much Phoebe.
Sure.
But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Sorry, Phoebe.
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
I can help with that.
Hi!
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
Whoa! Ohh!!
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Phoebe?
Well, she saw the ring.
So, who's the lucky guy?
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Did she freak out?
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
What else did you think about?
How many kids were we gonna have?
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
But we're not ready to tell yet!
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Hey! Hi!
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
And who pays for that?
How'd you pay for them?
Uh, credit card.
Um... my... father.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
YES!!!!!!!!
Okay!!!!!
Okay.
Here's your key
All right? What's going on?
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
That was gonna be my opener.
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Hey.
Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
I thought that was just a rumour.
Rachel said everything was okay.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
What, what are they talking about?
Rachel?
He's gonna eat the cake!
Oh man!
What?
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
Oh yeah.
Yes that would be lovely.
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Yes, you can pass for 19.
You want some help with that?
Thank you soo, much.
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
Whoa! Are you okay?
Never done that before.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Nope.
Hi!
Why? Because of the government.
Yeah!
Why?
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Here's your tea Phoebe.
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
It's so good. Oh, thanks.
Good.
No Phoebe I am mad!
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
Well, deep-deep-deep down!
Yeah, I'm just mad!
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
All right!
Hey!
What?
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Yes!
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
You can, I know you can!
All right, you ready?
No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
I don't think so.
Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
Ross, we can handle this.
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Oh, did you catch him?!
Oh my God!
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
Uh-huh.
Wh-what did he say?!
His dancing partner?!
Can you be my dancing partner?
That's not, prison lingo, is it?
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
His indian name?
Ahh.
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
Freakish.
That's what you say about porn.
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
You think you know me so well.
Yeah.
Okay, well I do know you.
He's retiling my floor.
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
What's going on?
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Wait, he's not here yet.
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
Yeah.
So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
Yeah.
So, did I hear Poconos?
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Now calm down Joey.
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Just uh, do the right thing.
Oh, I-I don't know.
Monica, what should I do?
What?
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Hi!
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
So how does it look?
You look great too.
You're an excellent patient!
Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
Like a pirate?!
Stick out your tongue.
Hello-dillillio!!
Oh, somebody's feeling better.
Take off your shirt!
Oh my!!
How desperate am I?
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Could we be more white trash?
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Really?!
Okay, we owe you a present.
Two! I've been engaged twice!
Still smoking cigars?
Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
No that's, that's okay.
It's for their own good.
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
You're strict.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
It's hard for some people!
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
He is right, isn't he?
Thank you.
I hate when Ross is right!
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
You think?
That is sooo not true!
Oh, good luck.
Good luck. And I'm still right!
What?
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
From here to the airport?
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
What about the time difference?
Yes! You're never gonna make it!
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Oh well, it's not so bad.
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Oh!
Then why did you move?!
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Well, well, you said it was practice!
Because I knew you were lying!
All right, come here!
Really, is he a swimmer?
Hoyt?
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
He's got the body for it.
I like that. What?
So um, who was she?
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
Rach...
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
We'll be waiting for you...
All right, so what do you say?
Or you could end up with everything.
Ooh, I like that.
No!
Oh, just do it!!
You look cute in bubbles.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
You realize what you are don't you?
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
What?
You're his bitch.
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Ohhh, OK.
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
Oh God, yes!
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
What's wrong with people having sex?
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
Sure, I love this part!
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
Come on in.
Hi!
Not as each other!
What about these? These look the same?
Definitely!
Oh, then no.
Hey!
Yes, you're having a boy!
Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Wha-
Oh, there's banana on it.
Hey.
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
So then you know?
What? Why, why would...
Hi, honey.
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
Hey, aren't you up next?
It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Thank you guys-guys-guys...
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
Why not?
Oh man! I did it again!
That's right.
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
I gotta get the before shot!
There's more beer, right?
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Does it involve clogs?
Does it involve travel?
Noo!
Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Clogs.
Does it involve travel?
What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.
Noo!
Does it involve clogs?
Are you serious? Oh my God.
Um, coffee to go, please.
Isabella Rosselini.
Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
We are not going to whistle.
Thanks.
We should do something. Whistle.
Come on, do it.
No!
You really think that'll work?
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
Let me ask you a question.
Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
Hmm.
Why did you hire me?
I so wanna be attracted to you.
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Oh, yeah. I know that.
But you're not. Okay, good.
I'm sorry.
Oh my God, it was incredible.
Hey.
Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Hey.
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
What?!
Why did they get divorced?
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
In case it happens.
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Why?
Hey!
Hey!
So, what are you saying now?
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?
Okay. Let's bring it in.
All right, we're gonna play.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Here you go.
How'd you pay for them?
Oh, how well you know me...
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
Uh, credit card.
And who pays for that?
Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
Hi.. how was the game?
The way he makes me feel about myself.
Yeah...
Well..
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
If you want, I'll do it.
That's... that's classic.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
Phoebe, it's been two days.
Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
So long, Vic!
Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
Uhh, those are tacos.
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
I'm not laughing.
That's a good call. Right.
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
And slept with the professor.
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" All right? I mean she's taken my class!
I'm gonna call her.
Yeah.
How about, you're moving!!
Because it's my apartment!
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Did she leave a number?
I was.
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
Did you see me write one down?
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
I can't believe I ruined this.
I am so sorry man.
Oh my God.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Great.
Hi, honey.
Well, we certainly are alone.
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Yeah! She's right in there!
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
This isn't even my dress.
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
Yeah, I think we are.
Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
I'm changing out of this.
Yep! You got the tickets?
Hey!
Hey! Are you ready yet?
Oh! Got 'em right here, check!
It's all London, baby! Here we go.
So have you called her yet?
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
See you later Mon.
What does it look like? I'm going home.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Because then I don't have to!
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Wh-why is that the best part?
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
I'm really not deciding!
I can't believe you're getting married!
Oh, well, that's great!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah.
Monica and Rachel made out.
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
Okay.
Sure? Thanks.
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Please, I'm not going for anything.
Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
Well, if you don't, I will.
Would you please go?
Well then get it, get it!
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
That tone will not make me go any faster.
Joey!
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Then...who did?
Uh-huh.

What are you smiling at?
Sorry. I'm sorry.
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
Yeah, right.
I do not have baby fever!
Oh and you know what I want!
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Well...I'd better get going.
Yep, yep...You?
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Could you not look?
Who wants it? Anybody?
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
I'll do it.
I said I'll do it!
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
This totally makes sense!
What?
She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
It does not!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Just the matter of ...payment?
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Dear?
Jack used to handle the finances!
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
She will be after tonight.
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
Yeah.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
We'll be waiting for you...
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
How-how are you, Mom?
So, uh, how's she doing?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
What?
Did you break up with her?
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Why?
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Ah actually, that is mine.
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
Oh well, where is he?!
What?
Really?!
She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?
Totally familiar.
Some moms do that.
Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
It's 9:30 in the morning!
Hey! You're wearing pants!
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
They got a breakfast buffet.
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
Well, it just seems that...
Why are so mad at him?
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
You stole them from me!
Gimme 'em!
No! They are mine!
You stole them from me!!
Gimme them!
You're plans were with us.
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
I have plans.
That's right.
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
What were you doing in Africa?
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
Working with blind kids.
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Makes me wanna puke!
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Phoebe!
You painting his toenails?
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
What?!
Oh, come on!
Chasing him all around the room?
What uh-What did you-What?!
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
Hey!
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
So! He'll understand!
What are you doing?
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
God, you are so strong.
Viva Las Gaygas!
I'm sorry!
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
Unfortunately that is correct.
Yes!!
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
It's your joke.
Is not.
Hi, oh hi.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
That's what it sounded like.
Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
All right...
Hey!
So'd you guys have fun?
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
Your boyfriend is so cool.
Really?
Oh, is everything in the car?
Oh, yeah, why not?
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
Yes. Did you settle the bill?
No. I hate this part.
But you told them you weren't?
But you are?
Yep.
That's right.
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
True story!
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
Yep, we wanna get married!
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
Hello! One marriage please!
Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.
All right.
So-so there is no party.
And you're not gonna do that.
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
You become friends after?
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Friends first? That's interesting.
No, never done that either.
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Oh, So you can move them!
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Not necessarily...
Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Really? Then why are you like that?
You by the door. In or out?
I feel terrible, I really do.
I don't know what else to say.
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Hard to tell, I was naked.
I used to wet my bed.
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
We both do that!
I know. I need more pie.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Oh my God.
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
You didn't break up with that fireman?
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
What?
Really? Your work laugh?
That noise you just made?
Oh, that was my work laugh.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
All right, check me out.
I don't know what else to say.
I'm gonna do it.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
I feel terrible, I really do.
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Got me.
Can I get a beer.
You betcha!
Is it the Italian guy?
Or Spin the Bottle?
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
It's not Christmas!
He's not 11!
Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
That was a terrible throw!!
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
How 'bout just a boom?
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
They're still in my coat.
I sure do! And you don't get one!
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
Damn!
Hey!
That noise you just made?
What was that?
What?
Oh, that was my work laugh.
Really? Your work laugh?
Wafer thin ice!
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Hey, I'm back!
Hi-hi Joey.
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Okay.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Monica...
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
What?
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Oh yeah.
I don't know, clean places?
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
Umm, yum!
It's Danny.
Ross, I thought you were over this.
If you wanna call that a reason.
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Let me get you some coffee.
Carol moved her stuff out today.
Ohh.
Thanks.
Ooh! Oh!
Joey look it's really sweet...
Joe...
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
That is true.
Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
All right all ready.
That's, that's funny. Change!
Hang on a second I just got in.
Men are such idiots.
Good night.
Good night.
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Score!! 7 to nothing!
I got it.
Go! Go! Go!
Are you okay?
Come on, let's go!
We are! Help us!
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Help!
All right! But, you do it with me once.
We have got to wash that!
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Yeah!
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
We haven't eaten yet!
Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
No, I just, I fell down.
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
You know, a party, or--
The green dress? Really?
Joey!!
Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
Nooo!
You just carry that around?
I know.
Hey!
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Between you and...
Okay, I freaked out a little.
Did not.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
I can't believe we're living here!
What is it?!
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
What?! What-what is it?!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
Too strong for me?
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Yeah.
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
Just some stuff for the party.
She told us.
So whaddya got there Monica?
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
What are you doing with the lamp?
I don't know, something girlie.
Hey, you're early.
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
Hi.
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
How come we have one extra place setting?
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Well, who's voice was that?
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Monica, you don't know that.
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Ross!
Oh, this is Monica.
Okay.
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
Well, uh, I ate some.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
Hello?
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Are you sure you wanna do this?
No, only because that's the graduation song.
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
Pete's breaking up with me.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Yeah, that'd be cool!
What?!
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
We checked. A lot.
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Nono, she's gone.
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Why else would we be here?
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Yes! Well that-yes.
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
We actually missed it.
Does it have to do with Joey?
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
No.
No.
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
About what?
Lucky bastard! Janice.
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
I'm fine.
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
Thank you! Break!
One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
So, where do you want to go?
Oh-no-no-no-no....
Just one drink?!
Hey, you like pizza?
Oh, that's sounds great.
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
I was in too much pain.
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
And then Joey remembered something.
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
When did I sign for it?
Why is this car in my bedroom?
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
Did you make brownies today?
Nooooo. You're really not going?
Yeah, well.
See, he's her lobster.
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
You're not gonna mess it up.
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Score! Now can we go?
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Ok, just one more point.
See, that's why we don't let her play.
Is everything all right?
Yeah, well they suck too.
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
So you didn't leave the bank?
Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, 'cause she called three times asking where he is.
Yes, I will tell her.
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
Why don't you just take it with you?
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Why don't you just call her?
Chandler is such an idiot!
I don't know.
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
Drink?
Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about.
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Would it matter?
Are you really not going?
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
Know what I mean?
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Let's do it!
How, how did that happen?
Brooklyn Heights.
Cleveland.
Oh my god.
What?
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Oh, let's not tell this story.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, come on!
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
Oh, dad, turn it off.
Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.
Everybody smile.
It is off.
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
Two girls and a boy?
We do not have one of those signs.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
Yeah!
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Your mother told you this?
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Yes!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Pass the cheese, please.
Noooo!!
All right, hang on!
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
Nope.
You need to give him money.
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Give him money? It was a joke!
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
The baby shower for Phoebe!
Oh-whoa, what party?
Well umm...
Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
I'm so glad you liked them!
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Come here. Okay, be right back.
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
We're switching rooms.
You're not just saying that are you?
Really!
Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
No, the man is a mess.
Was he crying?
You know, a party, or--
No, I just, I fell down.
On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
What party?
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
Wow, you worked in a mine?
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
You have to really wanna see it.
Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Yeah.
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
Ohh! Didn't know! Okay!
Okay! Ohhh no!
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Shhh!
Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Hey sweetie.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Awww. But still no.
You're so efficient. I love you!
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Let's go!
No-no-no! We need something old!
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
Look, you wanna get off my back?
You wanna get out of my face?
Something to remember me by!
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
Oh my God.
I know, the babies are asleep.
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
But my apartment!
That's that weird voice again.
Hi.
Hi there.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
I cannot push it in!
Okay, okay, okay.
I got it!
Could not be more terrified.
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Afraid to ask him?
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Yes? ..yes, she is.
..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
Okay, errrr, Monica?
Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Hi.
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
Pheebs, what are you doing?
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
What?!
We didn't order cake.
Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
Here are your cakes.
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
You're right.
Hey. It's him. Who is it?
'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
What bank is this?
It's Alan.
Chandler! He's here!
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Well then why can't I see it?
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
What?! You slept with Jason?
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
You'd already broken up.
How long?
Why isn't it working out?
Huh?
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Is he not cute enough for you?
Wasn't there a little song?
Oh God.
I've literally never been this happy.
Oh please God, let there be a song.
There was no song. There was no song!
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
Nothing.
Nothing?
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
You're not gonna mess it up.
Ten dollars an hour.
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
No.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
Pizza delivery.
Rach.
Oh.
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
And did he?
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
You did it! You got ordained?!
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Hey!
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Our minister...
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
Hey!
Hey!
What?
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
You still work at the multiplex?
I do?
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
What are you the memory woman?
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Maybe, because you told him not to.
Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
I'm gonna set them to my time.
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
You're gonna do what to my clocks.
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Okay, fine.
Okay fine, now Ross...
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Yes, but for the last time.
Oh, but-but I can't do it.
Why not?
And well, what did she say?
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
I did.
Thank you.
Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
Guys, we bought the tickets.
Me neither.
Me too.
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Why did you look at me when you said that?
That's it! Dinner is over!
No, give me the...
Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
What?
What?
Oh, no no no no no.
OK.
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.
No no no no.
007 gets all the ladies.
007 has a fancy car!
Batman has the Batmobile!
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
Ross's parents are my parents!
Joey!
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
Mon-Monica?
Yes?
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Oh, time's up.
Oh!
That's a bird?
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
There was nudity!
I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
They're still just friends, right?
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Yeah!
Hike!
Over here!
I almost caught that one!
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Carol's pregnant.
Ooh! I found it!
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
And I would have to say pah-huh.
No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
What?
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Oh, howd she take it?
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
Did you just smell my hair?
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
Oh, you're welcome.
Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
Oh God.
Not a basset, a bassinet.
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
Like a hound?
You really need the bassinet?
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Really? Who's number two?
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Uh, no, it's-it's just this person.
Okay well that's good to know.
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Eh...
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
You're kidding! Where? Where?
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Oh, Rachel!
See? It's no big deal.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
I don't like your massages.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
All right, what's goin' on?
Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
Not for you.
Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
Fine. All right, fine.
And I'm going to go get drunk.
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.
Hello.
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Cool.
Let's see!
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Unbelievable
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Yeah, you wish.
"You wish."
I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
Who?
It might be kinda cool.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
So I can do it?
Yeah you can do it.
We're never gonna find anybody.
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
Well then let me do it!
Joe...
Because the winner gets this!
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Oh really! Why is that?
The Geller Cup.
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Soakin' up all the culture.
Oh, I love museums!
Umm.
Yeah.
Where do you want to start?
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
Nothing, I don't know.
What happened?
Me too!!
Me too.
Joey! You didn't even know her!
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Ohhhh!
Ah whatever!
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Just go get some! Go!
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
At this?!
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Okay.
Who? Is that your sister?
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Ugh, she is a slut!
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Aw, it's soo unfair.
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
I love you too.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Rachel locked the door.
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
No.
Love is the best medicine.
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
That's laughter.
Why do you do it?
No it's not, it's second.
Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down.
Uh, hello, it's third down.
Wow!
Wow, what?
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
No, that is what the game is.
I just asked you.
I don't have time for this.
Which you just gave up really quickly.
Have you seen Joey?
How? I don't have any money.
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
Well, I have some.
How much?
Oh, he's catching up to her!
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
Oh, he sees her!
Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
He's taking her purse!
All right, I guess we should go.
Uh, HELLO!!
Hi.
No, wait. Wait.
Oh yeah right!
Well, I guess now we can't go.
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Why did you look at me when you said that?
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
You know what? You're right.
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
No.
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
Give it to me.
You al-you already had it?
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
Then I won't have to kill you.
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
I can do that.
So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
Yeah, thanks. You know what?
I can't find garbage bags!
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
Oh!
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
What is it?!
So, should I call him back?
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Noo! NO!
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Put all my money in me.
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
Do what?
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
I told you not to go down there!
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
What?! You got us evicted!!
Well he made Rachel cry!
Rachel always cries!
Do you want me to pick you?!
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Can I finish my story?!
See, I would never snap at you like that.
Continue.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
All right, I'll try not to.
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Hey, come on now!
All right, what are we havin'?
What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Sure? Thanks.
Monica, where did you get these?!
I made them!
Why don't you just go out with her!
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
Awesome!
Do you know anything about women?
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
No.
That's all right.
Okay, can we please go eat?
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Yeah. What are we getting?
Anything but stew.
See if he has ice.
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
So all we have is ice?
Okay.
Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Haven't we made this decision?
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
Yeah, all right.
Bye!
Did you go home and change?
Hey.
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
No, I haven't seen him.
Okay, you ready to open yours?
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Okay!
Yeah!
Okay.
Then why would he say it?
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
You owe me 20 bucks.
We all chipped in.
We did?
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
He might still show up.
Okay.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
Is that all?
So-so you would've just lied?
Really?
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Yes!!
Would it really have been that easy?
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Oh!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
I can't believe this!
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
Yep! And lot's of it!
Your favorite!
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Okay, in we go.
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Okay..
Oh! That was Lambchop!
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
Alright, we have to talk.
I thought you could use the help.
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
Coffee in a fight!
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
We'll put buckles on it.
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
What makes it pilgrim?
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, I can't pass for 22?
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
What?
Well, maybe 25-26.
I am 26.
You wanna get out of my face?
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
Look, you wanna get off my back?
Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
Give me that.
Are you saying I smell bad?
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
What's with him?
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
I used to love to play restaurant.
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
Did you make brownies today?
When did I sign for it?
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
Knock, knock.
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
Excuse me, where are you going?
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
Uh... to the bathroom.
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
You guys, I am not that bad!
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
That is so unfair!
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
Real magic does exist.
Wow.
I can't tell you that, no.
Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
Does that smell bother you?
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Thanks Monica!
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
Rach, did you check the machine?
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
I don't know, you might be the first one.
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
What did I tell you about the hall?!
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Ten dollars an hour.
No.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
You're welcome.
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Wow! The new Playboy!
Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!!
What? What?
That's probably what they'll say.
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
I'd like that.
Hey, gorgeous.
Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!
You guys. You suck too.
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Really?
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Sweety, what are you talking about?
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
I found a dried up seashores.
Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Sorry we're late.
Ah, that's OK, come on in. Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.
Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
We're switching rooms again.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
What? Why?
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
That's-that's not Phase Three.
Really?!
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Well, I'm there too!
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
About a half an hour.
No.
How long have we been home?
Lovely!
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
All right! Let's do it!
Woo-hoo!!
Why are so mad at him?
Wow umm, calm down.
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Well, it just seems that...
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
What are you doing?
Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
So she's a woman! So what?
Rdtor.
Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.
Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Joey!!
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Oh.
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Okay.
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Not even close.
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
All right!
Sit down.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Ohh.
What, he doesn't like Josh?
Who, Josh?
It's Joshua.
No, I don't.
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
What is it?! What about Pete?
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
No!
I don't know!
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
You just wanna each take one?
You stole them from me!!
Gimme them!
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
I can't believe you let them win!
I got it!!
Long!
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
I was frustrated.
The second sister dies?!
Okay that does sound like fun.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
No, I've looked everywhere!
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Or 45.
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
What, look back?
Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Well, no. But...
Just go over and say hi.
Ohhhhh!
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Hey, Danny!
Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Isn't he good?
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Cause I already invited her.
Well, how bout just her mom?
Why her mom?
Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
No, no, no, that's Dina.
Which one is Gina?
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
You're not gonna be phased out!
Oh, that poor bastard.
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Ehh!!
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
It wasn't the best.
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Well, the lighting was okay.
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Okay, if you really wanna have sex...
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Okay!
Worked like a charm.
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
No.
Seriously?
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Yeah, I guess.
We didn't give you any money!
We owe you?!
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
You don't think I know that!
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Promise me you'll be careful.
I promise.
Yeah.
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
That was a half an hour?
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
It's your timer.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
This woman's living my life.
Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
What?
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
You're a little high maintenance.
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Four.
Really?!
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
That's right. Did you hear something?
Do you know what's a bad idea?
Picking Rachel.
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
It's coming from the living room.
Feeling a little better sweetie?
You're right.
Tell him it's for you.
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Me too.
Oh, look, he's waking up!
No, why?
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
hey, fella! How you doing?
Aqui est.
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
Youre not gonna lose him.
Yeah. Okay.
No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
It's actually going to be just family.
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Centerpieces!
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Yes, they can stay with us.
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Well uh, do either of you smoke?
OK. Just for a little while.
Alright.
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
OK.
Ross kissed me.
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
Hi, Joe.
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
What?! Why?!
What is going on with you?
I'll get back to my new job.
Okay.
Okay.
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
Man, she is really gullible.
He's totally flirting with you too.
Chasing him all around the room?
Monica, please?
He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something...
Hey!
No. He's not a horrible guy.
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
Yeah, it's a vase.
Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
What do you mean?
And this goes for all guys?
Well that's pathetic!
Again true.
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Our minister...
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Oh Ross, you're so great!
Ohhhh
Oh...
You ok?
You start working on that list.
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
I cannot believe her.
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
I've gotta get back in the game.
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
For what?
Why, when did you get out of the game?
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Maybe not.
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Unless!
This is not the bed I ordered!
What's this?
Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
Phoebe!
I'm talking about me having a baby.
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
What are you talking about?
What?
Are you serious?
But you live here! You know that.
What?!
She wants me to move to London.
What-what-what are you gonna do?
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
It was a really beautiful service.
Morning. We ready to go?
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
What?
She lets you borrow them.
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
What's that?
Okay.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Anything larger back there?
In the bank.
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
I can't believe it.
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
What kind of karate is that?
Here. Y'know, just in case.
Oh, excellent.
No kind. He just makes it up.
So how's it going with you guys?
My parents will be so happy.
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
Hey. I was...
The wedding starts at six.
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
You'll vamp?!
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
Oh.
Hi.
Shoot! We're out of soda.
I don't ever want to see you again!
Umm, where's my purse?
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
Really?!
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Hi.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
Really?
Yeah! Oh yes!
Do you think he knew I was here?
Yeah you are!!
Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Ohhh.
Ahh, ahh, excuse me.
Why do you want to see my hand?
Oh my God, you're back!
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
Yeah.
What if I turn out the lights?
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Yeah, let's just forget it.
Okay!
Oh yeah.
What a minute, what did he say?
Oh! My hero! What happened?
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
What?! You got us evicted!!
Okay, throw it straight this time.
In like a half-hour?
Me too.
Okay.
I'm getting married next!!
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Who is being loud?
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
All right, we should call somebody.
Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Did she leave a number?
Did you see me write one down?
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
No! We only mess around at his place!
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
What? I-I said you had a-
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
What I said you had...
Would you stop?
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Ross, cough drops, please?
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
Pete, can I get you something else?
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
You gave her food poisoning!?
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Sit down! We're winning!
No! You can't do that!
Maybe I should go!
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Yes, every single one of them.
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
So you're free Thursday, then.
Oh, they-they sent me home.
Hi.
Why aren't you at work?
Why?
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
We just want you to think it through.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
I knew you were not okay with that.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Yeah, what-what's going on?
Third door on the left.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
Right!
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
No you can't.
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
From here to the airport?
Yes! You're never gonna make it!
I-I-I don't know.
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
All right, I...I have to ask.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
I would really love it if could do both.
What?
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
No, we can go to Williamsburg.
Eat your fish.
Okay, coming!
Hi, come on in.
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Yeah.
O-kay!
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Well you did a little bit.
Umm, can we see you ride it?
Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
Of course!
Okay. See?
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Really? My God, he's really cute.
Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Go for it.
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
Yes, but you are dead inside.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
All right well, I'd better take that back.
Wh-what, why?
So, what do you think we should do?
No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
I know I love you!
Electrical plans for the building.
Saucy!
What are these?
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Rach, come see who's out here!
Hi, Monica.
Ok, well, this was very special.
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Janice is gonna go away now.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Light still out?
Yeah.
Oh please, they're having sex.
Shut up!
Y'know which one was she again?
Mary-Angela.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
It's gotta be the first one.
Yes. But all the other ones.
No.
No, 'cause he's yummy.
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
Anybody want a croan.
Hell no, we'll pay!
Oh. Right.
You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
And you know what? We want a rematch.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected...
Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
Monica!!!
Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
That really was some of your best work.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
Really?!
That thing is not coming in here.
Yeah. That's okay, right?
Par-tay!
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
Hi guys.
You are beautiful.
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Here.
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
Is he gonna be ok?
You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
Jacket now.
It's coming from the living room.
That's right. Did you hear something?
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
I finished my book.
Hey, you guys.
Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
In.
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
They won't take you to the vet.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault.
Monica.
Chandler.
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Chandler? A word.
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
Okay.
Are you alright?
So you hit her in the face?
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
Aww, Pheebs.
Here, take a couple of these.
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
What is it?
It's Hexadrin.
They have racquets don't they?!
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
You're not even giving them a chance!
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Ok, you win.
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Uh huh. Why is that?
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
You have to go to London!
What?
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
How much?
Well, close to...
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Because you're the only one that can be fair.
Yeah.
Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
Rachel, get the book! The book!
Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Okay! Okay! Here!
The Bible?!
It is not over! You're over!
Then you go to Tokyo.
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
What?
You know!
How's the big anniversary dinner?
Hey.
Hey.
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Ohhh, nice.
It's my New Year's resolution!
Awful, absolutely awful.
What are you, what are you doing?
What, to blind my child?
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
In 1981 you were 13!
You know the hotels?
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Okay, she can't go.
Really? I only had two glasses.
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
I just had a glass.
Two.
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Oh my God!
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
Would you guys stop.
So how's it going with you guys?
What kind of karate is that?
No kind. He just makes it up.
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Oh, but it's made her so happy.
Do we have to tell her?
Yes, we have to tell her!
Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
Yeah.
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Oh you knew that. Good!
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Okay.
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Thank you! Thank you!
Oh, look! Look! Look!
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Guess what?
Okay, here comes another camera.
No, we never do that
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Why do they keep doing that?
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm...
Uh-huh.
What are you doing?
Pulling what? It's second down.
Wow, what?
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need.
I heard that!
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
Here, take a couple of these.
Well, at least you scared someone.
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
As much as they love you?
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Come on, you know they love you.
I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.
Hey.
Who are they killing off?
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Noo!!
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
Are you serious?
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
What do you say?
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
We already knew that!
I'm having a son. Um...
Shut-out!!
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Oh, okay, time's up!
All right, I got 48.
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Hey!
Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Hey!
Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Umm...
That's because I'm in front of them.
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Nope.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Are you saying I smell bad?
It's kind of an important one!
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
That's one?
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Off to see young Ethan?
Thank you.
Well then we still have a problem.
Can you blame him?
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
Yeah!
With what?
Oh my God. He threw up?
Okay.
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
Come on! I really need your help!
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
No-no-no-no-no!
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Why would they think they're invited?
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
You got me. I don't...
Joey!
All right, let's go say good-bye.
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Okay.
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Your a poet and don't know it.
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Hmmm... this is so nice.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
We have a baby?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Then...who did?
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
Okay, he's a senior in college.
He's... our age.
When we were?
College?
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Hey!
Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
That's it big girl! Come on!
Bye.
Or I'll hear you.
Wait!
You'd better run!
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Really?
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Only here.
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Okay!
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
I'm just trying to spice it up!
We won't. 300?
Monica?!
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
So you watched the movies huh?
Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
Charlotte who?
What if they get mixed up?
Alright, well tell me one of yours.
Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
All right, what about the third guy?
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Can you blame him?
Oop, your cake is ready!
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
Oop!
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
Hey.
What are you wrapping?
Yeah, it's a vase.
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Uhh, the mailman, the super.
Oh my God.
What?
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Yeah, me too.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
Okay.
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Uh-huh!
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
No, it's more like a good luck.
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
That's sweet.
So uh, what did this woman look like?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Okay that does sound like fun.
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
The second sister dies?!
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
You mean the spitter?
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
All right, what about the third guy?
Have you found your dress yet?
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
I'm Megan Bailey.
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Well there's not much we can do.
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
I have no idea what you just said.
What?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Put Joey on the phone.
What's up man?
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Phoebe!
Hey!
Well, it's going okay.
Well good, here let me help you out.
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Yeah, what's that like?
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
Hey! What's up?!
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
I am so glad you said cooks.
Bye.
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
I know.
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Then all your stuff would be here.
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
I make the decisions, and I say no.
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Our guy's a great dancer!
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
Oh, Chandler funny?
My guy is well read.
Our guy has great hair.
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Hi
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Rach, here's your mail.
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Hey!
Hey!
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Oh, how'd that happen?
Isn't he an architect now?
Ohh, how is he?
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Yeah, they still wear underwear.
OH MY GOD!!!
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Well, not anymore.
But we don't do that.
How drunk are you?
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
Well, you're not working either.
Yes, but I'm doing this.
Hey!
Hey.
Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Tony?
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Does anybody want anything else?
Promise me you'll be careful.
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
I promise.
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
You're a genius!
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
We are. He's meeting us here.
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
Please tell me it's his mother.
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Definitely not his mother.
Oh, no...
So you're free Thursday, then.
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Well, why would she lie to you?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah!
I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?
Ohh!!
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Ohhh.
What's wrong with the twentieth?
Which one was Pete Carney?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
What are you talking about? What wedding?
I love you, too.
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
Come on, like you never talk that.
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
Did I squeeze it too hard?
Let me try.
Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Hey sweetie!
Hey!
There's no back to this couch!
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
No-no-no! We need something old!
You're so efficient. I love you!
Let's go!
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
That'll work!
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
Okay.
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
Yeah.
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
So what did you do today Pete?
Okay.
So ask me what I did today.
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
What?! Oh.
Guys, you got your hair cut.
Um, this?
Yes.
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
I have not been sick in over three years!
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Oh.
007 has a fancy car!
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Batman has a utility belt!
Batman has the Batmobile!
007 gets all the ladies.
Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
Oh yeah.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
Yeah, it is.
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Do you know what's a bad idea?
That's a good idea.
Yeah!
Picking Rachel.
That's right. Did you hear something?
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Du-ude!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Pshhshhh!
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
I don't have an atlas.
Oh.
Oh.
Hold on.
OK, try this salmon mousse.
I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
Alright...
Mmmm. Good.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Yeah, sure.
Monica your remote doesn't work.
Oh. Aw, forget it.
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
Well, you're-you're sweating.
These-these are beads of joy.
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Yeah!
Oh my God! You're water broke!
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
Ohh!
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
Ready!
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
This is not a sign!
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
Never call me from that phone.
Joey, promise me something.
Yeah.
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
And then Tineals.
Okay, so how do we decide that?
What?
Bunny!
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
Okay!
Okay, you ready to open yours?
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
How many?
Nine.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
No really, they're OK.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
Aaaahhhhhhh.
I'm outa here.
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
I got it! Mine!
Hi.
Not so good.
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
What?! You're going out with her again!
You couldn't do it?!
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
Going out with who?
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Put it out!!
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Pshhshhh!
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Would it really have been that easy?
So-so you would've just lied?
Yes!!
Yes!!!
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Pete, can I get you something else?
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Yeah that's the same.
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
Which one?
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Hi!
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
But I'm...
I hate men! I hate men!
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Hey!
Hey!
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
What?!
That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
It is starting to get dark out there.
I gave you a key for emergencies!
Hello, people who do not live here.
Hi! Hello!
We were out of Doritos.
Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
That's right baby.
All right, let me in.
What?
He's a dropper!
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
Look, you don't want to fight me.
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Hey!
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
No!
Okay.
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
What the hell is this?
Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
Grazie.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Yeah?
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
Where are they?
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
Over here.
Have a seat son. Hey!!
I know.
You gave my father a lap dance!
Well, how bout just her mom?
My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
Why her mom?
Cause I already invited her.
I have some pretty exciting news!
Hey, have you seen Rachel?
No, why?
You're pregnant!
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
Oh really! Why is that?
Because the winner gets this!
You still have feelings for me don't you?
Oh God.
What?
Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
Pete.
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
Here, we are.
The what?
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
Yeah, baby!
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
Really?!
Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
Did they just kill off Joey?
Drake, look out.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
No. Now maybe.
C'mon.
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
What?
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
All right!
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Hey Joe!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
So to get this part you can't be?
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
Barmifsaed?
Nope.
But you are?
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
A pharmacist.
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
It's okay, I got a plan.
We're gonna find love!
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
I'm sorry but...nothing.
She has to know that your not ready.
Nooo!
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
I suppose mainly sexual.
...Hm.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
I am good. I finished my book.
Oh my God!
So, how are you?
Oh yeah, what's it about?
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
All right, I'll try not to.
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Yeah! C'mon!
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Oh, you're kidding.
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Too strong for me?
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Uh, wait, backstage?
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Bye you guys!
Bye-bye!
Okay!
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
What?
They've arrested Monica.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy.
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Salad.
Bread. Aren't you a chef?
Oh.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Oh, I know.
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
She is so great! I miss her.
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
You've got to be smooth about it.
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Of course, sir.
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
I wasn't escaping.
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
You were trying to eat it!
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Does he not make enough money?
Is he not cute enough for you?
No!
No, I'm just....
Maybe there's someone else.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
Joey?
Ma?
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Hey, this- Heyy...
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
Pizza guy!
Thank God. Food.
Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
Well then we'll get wet.
Pheebs?
Yeah?
You don't want to know what tonight was.
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
What was tonight?
Okay. What was tonight?
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
We're gonna see each other naked.
Wow! You are really fast!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Yep!
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Wow Joey, this is, uhh...
Get out.
No.
Art.
Art it is.
Y'know, the possible side affects.
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Say what?
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Hello, Joey.
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
And I would have to say pah-huh.
What?
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
And his puppet too.
Why do you care so much anyway?
I don't get this! She was horrible!
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
I don't what your talking about.
Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
I wish all guys could be like him.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
I know.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Chasing him all around the room?
You painting his toenails?
Oh, come on!
Monica, please?
He's totally flirting with you too.
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Do you all promise?
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Hey, Pheebs.
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
That you're not funny or sexy?
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
That's right!
Hey Estelle, listen...
Here you go. You can wear this.
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Thanks!
Uh-huh.
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Aw, Mon...
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Right.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
I remember when we first got engaged.
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Noo!
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
What?
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
You do?
You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
I swear you said you had the keys.
For an emergency just like this.
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
Am I naked again?!
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Oh, you bet I am!
Okay, here's your penis!
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
So?!
And you know what? We want a rematch.
Hell no, we'll pay!
OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
I was probably waiting for it to open.
We've got a box.
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
I gotta tell you, you look great now.
You look great too.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Kiss me!
Oh, Chandler, sorry.
Hi, Monica.
Ok, well, this was very special.
Okay! My turn! My turn!
Congratulations!
Thank you!
Okay! Okay, ready?
Yeah.
I had to go with the odds Rach.
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
The commercial?
DON'T...be too long with the phone.
Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
It's a woman.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
It was.
Then, what's the problem?
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Why is this car in my bedroom?
I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
Phoebe!
I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
When did I sign for it?
No he went out to get pizza.
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
Is Ross here?
Oh really, OK.
That's great.
5 6 7 8!
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
Oh.
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
But, I put some honey in it.
Here you go sweetie.
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Hey-hey, check out the hat!
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Ross gave it to me.
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
It's Joshua.
Oh, whatever.
Well, I hate to eat and run, but...
No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
OK, I'll see you later babe.
Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works.
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
See ya.
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
Honey, it isn't good luck.
Oh my God! Monica!
Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
Are you okay?
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
What's going on?
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Oh, yeah.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Big time!
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Why?
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Come here, I want to show you something!
Ross didn't scare you?
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Okay!
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
I sure do! And you don't get one!
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
Very good Monica! You know where they are.
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
They're still in my coat.
She's leaving for three months.
If the school finds out you're fired.
Hmm.
For camp!
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
Is your tongue swelling up?
Oh my god.
Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
So you talked to your dad, huh.
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Wow.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
You call that delicious?
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Ooh.
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Hey.
Somebody got in late last night.
When did this happen?
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
You got it.
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
Give it to me.
Ok, you can have it.
That was there when I got here.
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Or?
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Seven times!
In a foreign, romantic country...
I blame London.
You got a callback too didn't you?
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
Yeah I did!
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
Yes it has! I made cookies!
Hey! How's it goin'?
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.
I'll help you throw out your purse.
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
And where is your hat?
Ahh that's the 2 points.
Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
Oh my God.
And some of us really have to pee.
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
We're worried about you.
Sorry Joey
Hey.
Please tell me you're stopping now.
Oh!
It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
Joey we know you steal our food.
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
I'm good.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Oh, just until the glue dries.
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Thank God!
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
That would be the work of a Blowfish.
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
Who gave you that hickey?
Oh!
Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
You start working on that list.
I cannot believe her.
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
Oh.
I see what you're doing!
Oh-oh.
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Hmm.
Oh.
I see what you're doing!
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Can you hear anything?
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
So Pheebs, pick one of them.
Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
I think you're better than you think you are.
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Really? Okay, so...
Know when to stop.
Is he not cute enough for you?
Why isn't it working out?
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
No!
Does he not make enough money?
Hey! My first review is out!
I love working with designers!
With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
All right, look at my on the back page.
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Kill me. Kill me now.
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
You're kinda stepping on the song.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
He didn't ask me to marry him.
So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
Ohh.
Well then definately don't take his name.
Nah... not-not special enough.
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Waaay too special.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
Do you always have to bring him here?
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
You can spill. In the sink.
What?!?!
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
I love you, too.
OK, here you go. Good luck.
Rachel, there's nothing in it.
OK, then get me your purse.
: Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
...teen!
Well, I just caught the live show.
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Yeah.
Eww.
Hey there.
So it's okay to date a student.
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
What kinda things have you been saying?
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Well, you're just gonna have to try.
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
Chandler!
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
Thank you.
You-you have a very beautiful... eye.
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
And Mindy, your maid of...?
Barry who you almost...?
Barry who I almost.
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
I know, but you have to open it today!
I got you a present!
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
Okay.
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
Sure.
This is really hard for me to say.
Oh, no, no, it's about you.
What about me?
Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.
That really was some of your best work.
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
Well, these. These are yours right here.
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Five more and I'll flash you.
C'mon give me five more. Five more.
No.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Alright, well tell me one of yours.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.
What if they get mixed up?
Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
Hide the Lamp.
Monica, let it go.
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
I love that movie.
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Cat.
I love you too.
Uhh, we still need a tip.
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
We are switching back, right now!
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
I don't know.
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
Least of all you.
Why? What you'd do?
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Well, what about my stuff?
You don't have any stuff.
Hey, how long are you in the city?
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
Oh, this is my friend Roger.
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Yeah.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Let me see the earrings.
Oh, honey, the earrings...
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
That'll work!
I don't think so.
Here just...take this.
That's stealing!
I don't think mine likes me either.
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
And the way she slaps all the time!
Oh!
Don't do it.
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Crazy bitch.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Hey.
Hey.
Rachel! That was a library card!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
Why, do you write him a lot?
So you're moving in with him. What happened?
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Can you go any faster with that?
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Nope, not that one.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
Haven't we made this decision?
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
Hi!
It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
You had no right to go out with him.
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
I KNEW IT!!!!
That is the most ridiculous...
You sold me out.
What, that little thing at the prom?
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
So the going for help went well?
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
I never stop thinking about it.
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Why?
Because you're marrying him!
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Sure.
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
God, look what I found in the drain.
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
I'm not breaking up with her!
What?!
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
Why can't you use the phone in here?
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
You guys ready fore the movies?
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Wow.
Aren't you going to swallow that?
Yeah, isn't that great?
Mmm.
What are peanut butter fingers?!
There were only twelve.
Oh yeah, I added three.
Oh yeah...
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
I don't want things to change! Do you?
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
Me too!
No!
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
Demi Moore is not a he.
How who wears it?
Demi Moore.
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Come on! I really need your help!
No-no-no-no-no!
Okay.
So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Honey, we have been through this before!
Hey!
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
You didn't even take off your pants.
Huh?
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Yeah, well, lucky for you.
What?
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
Works on you.
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
They really were pretty, weren't they?
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Yeah.
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
Hey, the man's dog just died.
Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
The Luisa from home room!
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Yes!!
You have no idea who I am, do you.
Did you like learn about her family?
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
You-you think?
Two brothers, one died!
Yes!!
God! If you're gonna cry about it!
You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
Okay, I'm sorry.
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
I KNOW!!!
Open up! Open up! Open up!
What the hell is going on?!
We took our apartment back!!
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Whoa! Are you okay?
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?
Why?
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Yeah, big!
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
Monica.
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Uh.
No way!
I know, but look at me all tan.
Oh, here's a great one.
Yeah, I'm not in that.
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
Strip Happy Days Game?
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
OH YES!!!!!
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
Sperm.
So you're really doing this, huh?
Sounds nice.
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Boys? We're going in.
.....Hi.
Carol's pregnant.
Ooh! I found it!
Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
You didn't know that already?
Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Yeah, come here!
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Okay, good bye!
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
What?
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
I know.
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
Sure.
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
You look fabulous honey, you really do.
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
Yeah? Are you sure, really.
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
Oh, it's like a skit.
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
In Human Resources!!!!!!
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
Do I have my own castle?
Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
Great, now he's waving back.
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
What kinda stuff?
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Ohh! That's great!
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
No, the little girl creeps me out.
You said the baby.
Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!
Joey, you had the night!
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
I have some pretty exciting news!
You're pregnant!
Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe.
Hey! Hi!
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
Oh, that is better.
Are we in London?
I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.
What?
Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
Ooh, nice.
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life...
Yeah?
Umm, you've got some on your pants.
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
What?
I'll just throw them out.
These little women. Wow!
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
No, I think it's cute.
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
Gotcha.
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Well...
Havin' some trouble?
Rachel locked the door.
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
My surprise party!
What surprise party?
Well, he didn't tell me.
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
Thank you.
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
What about when I started dating Chandler?
We really do feel bad about this though.
We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Crap.
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
Oh my God!!
Congratu!! -lations-lations.
Oh well y'know.
Yeah, I do know.
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
My guy has great teeth!
Our guy smells incredible.
Hey.
Huh.
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
That - that's an idea.
Oh?
Oh?
Have you guys picked a date yet?
Hey!
Oh, the Olympics.
Oh no, not yet.
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Come on, we can't let them win!
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Hey, dude!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
We were just waxing our legs.
It's okay, it's okay.
We're all right.
Off?!!
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
I tried! They won't take her back.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
What's block?
I thought you meant in life.
Break.
We, we just wanna see the end.
I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
I want you Drake.
I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Ha. Ha, ha.
What?
Me going out with Richard's son.
Yeah.
What's twisted?
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
A kiss? What are you talking about?
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Yeah! No?
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Come on, Rach.
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Really.
Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
No.
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Uh-huh.
1...2...
Okay.
That's okay.
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
I'm crying here!!
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
I do the same thing.
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
Well, these. These are yours right here.
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
So, I'll get-get back to my friend.
I know.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
Oh, that'd be great.
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
You really ok with it?
Oh honey, I'm fine.
What? Alright, what about my two?
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
All you had to do was buy the card!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
Monica bang!
Okay, I heard that.
Uh-huh.
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Who was that?
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Ten dollars an hour.
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
That is incredible! You are the master!
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
We do not have one of those signs.
I like that. What?
You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
Two girls and a boy?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh yeah? When?
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
Yeah, I'll sit down.
It's good to see you
Why? Do you have a report due?
Done.
Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
I make the decisions, and I say no.
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
All right.
Yeah, sure. Good luck!
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Yeah?
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Okay.
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
And lucky means, more cleavage?
You changed?
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Does for me.
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Have you even had a girl up here?
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
You're bachelor pad?!
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Yeah, you do!
Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Look, can, can you do something for me?
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
High-five, the babies are coming!
Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
I guess they're back from their date.
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
Music. Very nice.
Oh my God!
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
Well when can we have this shower?
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
This bicep?
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Of course I did.
"When can you move in?"
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Hey!
She's right y'know.
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
Oh, I'd say about a month.
Half hour.
Interesting.
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
But no. Maybe if I were baking.
No no no no.
Impressive.
Bye-bye.
Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
Mmmm, no.
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Well, you-you know what I meant.
So what job did you get Joe?
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Okay, hold my crawler.
Okay.
Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
Okay.
I'll check the kitchen floors.
Yum-my!
Larry?
Is there? Is there someone else?
Maybe there's someone else.
Wha...
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Hello, people who do not live here.
Yeah, it was.
All right then. Bye.
Hi! Hello!
I gave you a key for emergencies!
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
Hey! So, did you quit?
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
And that's funny, why?
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
You mean dying man?
Yes!
Really? Really?!
Yes!
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
A pharmacist.
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Hang on a second I just got in.
Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
That's, that's funny. Change!
Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
We could not, would not want to wait.
Well we... we kinda broke up.
You too.
What happened?
Awwwwwwww.
Does anybody want these?
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Yes, but for the last time.
Okay fine, now Ross...
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
You guys don't think I look 19?
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
I know, it is isn't it?
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
And they weren't looking at you before?!
No.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Hi.
So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.
Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Yeah.
Okay, scarf's done.
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Chandler?
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
I'm not sure.
Hi!
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
How did that happen?
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
It'll be a short one.
Ohhh...
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Ross, she's 25 years old.
Uh-hmm.
Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
So what! I still have-No you're probably right.
Hi!
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Let them win one.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
And yet, we're still poking him.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
He's alive! He's a-live!!!
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
He does not look happy.
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
What?
Drops. Here, they're free.
Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later.
Thanks again.
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Hey!
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Looks like he's playin' baseball.
Ross.
Yeah.
You mean hardball?
Whatever.
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Why?
He does?
Say again?
Have you ever taken out the trash?
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
Third door on the left.
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Ohh! Really?!
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Okay.
Op.
Yeah.
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
It's a lovely apartment.
I was just being polite, but, alright.
What's up?
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
It's so good, isn't it?
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Good-bye muscles!!
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
Then, you're redoing it because...
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
I'm sorry honey.
Yeah.
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
And yet, here we are doing it again.
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
Oops.
What?
Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.
Everybody smile.
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
No, was he any good in it?
Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Oh, yeah.
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?

Where can I wash up?
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.
Hey!
Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
Thanks.
Why do you need it?
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Hey.
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Seven times!
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
Get away from me I said no!
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
Bye.
Home is Home Star stew.
Ah, anything we might of heard of?
Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..
Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
Hmm, bummer.
That, you get? That, you get?
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Yes!
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
You can let some of them go by!
Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
I just hope...
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
What makes you think that I might not be okay?
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I saw Richard.
Oh.
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Noo!! Okay!!
Okay!
I have some moves.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
You've never met Bob, have you?
Which?
Which what?
No, but he's...
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
You hated me when we were kids?
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
Hey!
Mon, look who I ran into!
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Ohh!
Oh God.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
You still want to move in together right?
Yeah, no, me neither.
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
Of course!
Ross didn't scare you?
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
Oh, y'know..
Did he mention us?
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Is it okay for me to come in now?
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Uh-huh
Why is everything different?
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
I just asked you.
I just asked you.
Can you just hold on for one minute?
Phoebe?
Yeah!
No, you have to let me in right now!!
Are you alone?
Ross they're really, really, really white.
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Come on, seriously.
Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
Come on.
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
Okay, I think I got it.
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
I'll help you fix your sweater.
I'll help you throw out your purse.
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
No come on. Come on tell me.
No. See you don't understand.
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Joey!!
Yeah?
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
We're gonna see each other naked.
Yep!
Count of three?
One!
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
What uh-What did you-What?!
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
Go! Come on! Roll!
Roll-roll!!
What did you just say?
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
No, just a barrel.
Really?! Really?!
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
People! People say it! Come here!
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
What people?
So oysters, huh?
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
Yes but my mom got me this job.
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Yeah!
Uh, yeah.
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Thanks.
Aww, there we go.
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
Yeah, am I in it?
Honey, you are in it.
Oh, yeah!
Keep talkin'.
She sent the chicken back again?!
Sorry!
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
Why is it sick?
Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
Yeah.
Carol moved her stuff out today.
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Cookie?
Ohh.
Let me get you some coffee.
That cold makes you sound so great.
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
Way to go, Phoebe!
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica.
What?
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Thank God.
See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
What is it hon?
We were shopping, and we had lunch.
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
What?
Oh, all right. What did I have?
You had a salad.
Please, just a little bit off the back.
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
You know, I think I was sixteen.
I'm still on "no."
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
All right.
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
Why, do you write him a lot?
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Thank you, Monica.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Oh my God, what happened?
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
What are you doing?
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Did you break up with her?
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Okay!
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
He- he pooped in my shoe.
Rachel lost Marcel.
Oh no, how?
Which one?
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
All right, I'm outta here!
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
It's Clint! Clint!
What's up with Gene?
Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Oh my God!
Boy, you are really not a morning person.
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
What is that noise?
And the way she slaps all the time!
Nice.
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
Oh!
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Ooh! Brian's Song!
The meeting with the guy went great?
Please! I made this game what it is.
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
Not fun anymore?
I'm still hungry!
Because we won our apartment back!
Okay. Okay. Ace!
Why are you screaming and hugging?
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
And the fact that they're both monkeys.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
Any luck?
Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
Hey!
Hey!
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Three!
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Eh!
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
Well good, here let me help you out.
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Well, it's going okay.
Oh, thanks!
Yeah!
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Not great.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
All right, so what were you thinking?
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
Excuse me?
What are you guys doing?
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Well, so do a lot of people.
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
Hey there.
What?
Humm, really?
Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
You know Paul?
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Of course it was a line!
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Chandler!
I'll be right with you.
What-why?
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Yeah, you bet.
Oh.
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Good. What made you change your mind?
How are you still single?!
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
How did that happen?!!
They really were pretty, weren't they?
Come on! Chandler!
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Oh, I will.
Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Can I ask you a question?
Sure!
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
And now you want that money back.
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
And I too am just a love machine.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
What does she mean?
I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
She could be you.
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
Dude!
Sorry.
That is so funny. Let me see that.
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
Are you ok, Ross?
I don't know. What's in this pie?
Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
No.
Really?! Are you sure?
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-
Okay!
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Great!
Yeah, what town are we near?
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
All yours.
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
Chandler!
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
No, there were two.
Including me?
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Wish me luck.
Good luck!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
That you're a liar.
No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
Well, who wouldn't?!
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Yeah right.
Why is that so funny?
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Yeah, okay.
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
I kissed Kathy.
What?
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
He took my snack!
I'm not getting into this again!
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
It-it's so great to see you both here.
Nora!
Charles.
Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
There's a Mr. Bing!
No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
This hummus is great.
God bless the chickpea.
And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
I used to wet my bed.
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Hey.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....
She seems fine now.
Good, they feel good, in my head.
Really.
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
So, it's great to see ya.
You too.
My God! Is this a gym card?
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
All right that's it, school is in session!
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
So why don't you quit?
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
You brought a carrot?!
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Not broad backed!
What? I can't cancel on Joan!
Why not?!
Stop sending food to our apartment.
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Naa, she's lyin'.
Well, why're you all dressed up?
You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Okay.
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Normally, I would not do it.
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
Say you're sorry.
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
So?!
Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Oh right, right.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Okay.
I'm really gonna miss you.
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
Hey!
Hey-hey!
I am now!
Hey roomie!
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
Oh, this is so hard.
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
My parents are dead.
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Again, it's not that he...
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Shut up! This place is a hole!
Okay.
See, this is a great apartment.
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
To Monica!
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Okay.
It's a sock bunny.
Not really.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
I didn't know you had another level.
I know! Neither did I!
Yeah.
Oh, from who?
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Is everything okay?
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
What?!!
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
Uh-huh.
Monica bang!
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
All right, look at my on the back page.
Hey! My first review is out!
Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
Oh, come on! Come on!
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
He is the man in the black dress.
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
I'm Amanda.
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
What?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
No I didn't!
Yes, you did!
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Yeah, so?
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Why?
Why?
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
I'm not your best friend?
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Okay. Oh yes.
Hey!
Did the girl ever let you ride it?
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
Ohh.
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
That is so unfair!
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Wow!
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.
Jason?
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
What a pity stay?
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
Which one?
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Hypothetically!
Still.
Uh-hmm.
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Hey!
What's up?
Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
Guys, I'm happy too.
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
Do we have to know about that?
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Really? Okay. Great!
We're in a relationship?
I'm afraid so.
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Okay.
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
I have quarters!
Hey!
All I say is, she better get the job.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
I know.
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Hey!
Hey, Mon.
Do I ever.
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
Yes!!!
Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
I mean don't you trust her?
Well, yeah!
You grow up.
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
Shut up, and put my table back.
Yeah. Thank you.
That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Okayyy!
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
Let go! Let go!
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Ow!!
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
He carries a briefcase.
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
That's not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
If the school finds out you're fired.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
Hmm.
She's leaving for three months.
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Noo!!
Nice.
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
I'm not macho.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!

They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.

Why not?! I'm hungry.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
Ah.
Oh hey!
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
How crazy that we'd run into you!
Ross!!
Ross!
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
...And boogie!
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
Yeah?
So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
And he was my best student.
All right, we'll call you when we get back.
No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
Thank you.
Okay.
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
Isn't there?
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
Then why are you laughing?
It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.
Frozen lasagnas?
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
This is all of your things.
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
I'll take it all.
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Naked?
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Wafer thin ice!
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
What?
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Hey, hey, they're runnin'
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
You're welcome.
Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
You have Knicks tickets?
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
Yeah.
Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Hey!
There he is!
Just, y'know out.
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
So we can be friends who sleep together.
You really sure?
I'll call you back.
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
I just grabbed a spoon.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
Why would the little girl creep you out?
You said the baby.
Why would the baby creep me out?
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
This is going in your book?
Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Was that the cake?
Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
I hope it's okay.
Oh...
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
Chandler!
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Monica!
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
No, only because that's the graduation song.
What are you doing?
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Are you sure you wanna do this?
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
God. I love you.
I guess we just keep dancing.
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
Okay. Umm...
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Damnit Phoebe!!
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
What?!
I might've said that. Why is that funny?
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
Hi!
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Pick a number! That is your only job!
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Yes.
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
Me too.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
No!
Oh my God!
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
No. No, you're not a loser.
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'
Monica.
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
I was laughing.
Out loud?
So how are you doing?
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
The show?!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
The wedding starts at six.
Can we just start throwing things in?
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
You know the words! You are so into this!
You are soo enjoying this.
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
Rach?
Yeah?
Well, it's my cat.
What?!
What about these? These look the same?
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
I am definitely gonna watch that!
Definitely!
Not as each other!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
Are you serious? Oh my God.
Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
Yeah, maybe.
Oh-oh, you lie.
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Nothing.
Oh, maybe that's it.
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Oh God!
How many kids were we gonna have?
You thought about that?
Yeah.
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
What else did you think about?
When, when did-how, how did you...
What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
Umm, no.
We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so...
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Okay.
Centerpieces!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
There's more beer, right?
Not one that can pee on the roof.
What's this?
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
And is this in case the house sneezes?
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Really?!
Really?!
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
So maybe we should just. . .
Yeah.
So.
Yeah, yeah, maybe.
Wow, this really sucks.
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
What?
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
The best man? Wow!
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
That's my sister.
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Pheebs, what about you?
Oh... Milwaukee.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Oh, you're kidding.
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
How about Mockolate mousse?
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
What makes it pilgrim?
We'll put buckles on it.
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
'Cause that's just your taste.
Oh yeah?
Yeah!
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just-that was my puppy.
Oh!
It depends on who asked.
What if I asked?
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
I can't believe this!
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Monica, Monica is great.
Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Yeah, isn't he?
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
But you've only slept with two people.
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
Right.
Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Hey.
Hey!
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
What? Ow!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Sorry, that was wax.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
No.
Does it have to do with Joey?
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
Ooh! That's so nice...
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
Yeah, I don't need it.
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
You be okay?
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
I know!
Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Are you drunk?!
Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Monica? Monica!
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.

Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.

Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Oh, they-they sent me home.
Why?
Okay.
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Oh I am!
Okay, fine!
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Are you okay?
I need some milk.
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
What happened?
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Okay, now I've really have to go!
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
I don't care, she slept with me.
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
Thanks.
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!

Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
Aww, not right now.
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
OK, ready when you are.
Okey-doke.
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Open it up, let me see.
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Ooh, God it looks bad.
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
I'm having a really good time!
Me too! I'm sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Oh, come on! Come on!
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
Yeah. I guess.
Just get your nails done?
Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy.
Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.

I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
You got all that from saline solution?
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
Hey, you.
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Hey! What are you guys doing?
Hey.
I'm sorry, who?
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Not necessarily...
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
What what what what?
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
What about the part where he has rabies?
That's not the end.
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
I wasn't ready for it.
Saw Regis Philbin once...
Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
Until now.
Oh, hi.
Oh my God, honey that's great.
I know. I just can't find...
I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
I am good. I finished my book.
Oh yeah, what's it about?
Yeah, I do.
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Is that some kind of boat talk?
What?!
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
What?
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Shut up!
Tell me what?
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Really.
Yeah. What do you think.
Come on, seriously.
Ross they're really, really, really white.
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Excuse me?
Well, I just...
Really?
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Sure, what do you got?
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
You're Lewis Posin.
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
Really?!
Really?!
You gave my father a lap dance!
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
I know.
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
And! We also have speaker phone.
All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?
Yeah.
Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
What? It's, it's just a phase.
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
How much did ever really win before?
Yes!
So I really never get to win anymore?
Pheebs!
Hey!
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
I hope Ben has a little sister.
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Hey!
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Yeah, it's in there.
Ok will do. So glad you came.
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
What?
Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
Hey Mon!
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
What? We could do it!
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can't do it!
No because it-it didn't seem important.
Yeah baby! No baby!
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
My God Monica!!
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
...Now that was fun.
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
Thanks.
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Yeah? That's so nice!
Night.
Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Okay. Sorry.
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
That's what you say about porn.
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Which one do you think she is?
May I help you?
You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
What does she mean?
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
We could not, would not want to wait.
Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
I don't know, you might be the first one.
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
How did you know about that?!
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
And no one touches the air around the TV!
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Oh no-no-no!
We still have porn.
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Did you bring the toe?
Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and-
What?! What is it?
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Or! A bakery delivery person.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
What?!
I wa-I wa-I wa...
Pizza?!
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Thank you.
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Hey!
No, it's just my luggage.
Hey!!
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
That's your call.
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Are they, uh, firm?
They'r alright.
Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Urghh!!
What are you guys woofing about?
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Well this is just sad!
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.
What?
What?
Why.
Just go.
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
Hey guys.
Hey Mon.
Aww. Ohh!
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
You are an idiot. .
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
That's nice.
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
Eww!
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
We need a hat..
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Only if you say his full name.
Hey.
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
Alright.
I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!
No!!
I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
I know the code to his answering machine.
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
What's goin' on?
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Thanks, Mon.
Well, of course.
Monica!!!
Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Probably kill myself!
..Excuse me?
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Hi.
Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
Look, can, can you do something for me?
Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
I highly doubt that.
So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
What did they do?
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
No-no.
No! I'm up for a Soapie!
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
That's because I'm in front of them.
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Joey we know you steal our food.
I'm good.
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Is that a swing?
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Oh, yeah, right.
Really.
I mean, that's a typical guy response.
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
Actually, I don't like martinis.
Ooh, yum!
Hey.
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
This is my dress!
No!
And now you'll see me buying it.
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
I just had sex.
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
Oh my God, Richard.
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
Monica! Chandler!
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Arghhhh!!!!!!
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
I'll take it!
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
Wow, it's really long.
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Yeah!
I'm so happy for you!
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
Little village people.
Oh, that is so sweet!
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
My marriage is over.
What?!
Here.
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
How many fingers am I holding up?
Now, open your eyes.
Okay, they are.
Four.
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
You sold me out.
I did not sell you out.
Would you let me talk.
Did you just flick me?
Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
And well, what did she say?
Thank you.
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
You just did a little dancy thing.
No I didn't.
You are soo enjoying this.
No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Nice shoes, huh?
Aah, y'killing me!
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Do you always have to bring him here?
I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
What?
Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
Great. So the ball is in his court?
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Ball? There is no ball.
Joey, please!
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Hey.
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
Why?! Why on the lips?!
Well, technically it seven billion years ago...
Oh no! Oh no!
I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
All right.
Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Oh.
Is Ross here?
No he went out to get pizza.
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Can I get you something from the bar?
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
I have not been sick in over three years!
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
Hiii.
Oh no, what happened?
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Oh. Hel-lo!
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Santa? Really?
Yes, is that okay?
Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute.
Hey.
Hey! So, did you quit?
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Oh it's important!
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
What?!
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Okay.
Give me the good stuff.
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Half hour.
Interesting.
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Huh. A moo-point?
I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
The park huh? A public place.
Uh-huh.
Hi Chandler.
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
What?
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Monica!
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Okay!
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
My joke wasn't funny.
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
Why not?
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
OK, stop.
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
Hey roomie!
Okay, bye!
Are you pregnant?!
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
You know what?
What?
But, we pick again! We pick again!
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
Yeah baby!
Why?!
I don't know!
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
What?! Oh.
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Ohh. What is this?
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
The park huh? A public place.
You didn't!
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Uh-huh.
I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
I don't know.
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
How'd it go with Pete?!
Tell us!
I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
Yeah, could you scooch?
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Oh yeah!
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
How do you know exactly what she's going through?
I hope she's OK.
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
She told us.
So whaddya got there Monica?
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
So you like it?
Oh, you're welcome.
Did you just smell my hair?
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
And we don't work hard?
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
And you feel like we hold you back.
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
I made fun of his accent.
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
No.
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
I will.
Do you want me to call?
What is your job?
Staying out of the way.
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
The head tilt?
Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
What's 'pleh'?
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
What do you mean?
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
What?
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
Okay, one more time.
Perfect decibel.
I know!!!
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
Here, let me try.
Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
OK, tip the man.
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
Condoms?
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
You can't just call Monica's room.
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
What?
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?
Phoebe?
What?! Monica, I'm scared!!
Yeah.
And! We also have speaker phone.
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Almost never.
Ok.
Anytime you're ready.
Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
No-no, it's really not huge.
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
No.
Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.
I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
Oh God! I gotta go!
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Monica.
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
What?!
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
Please tell me you're stopping now.
I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
What? Alright, what about my two?
Right, and...
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
There's an ad for a naked chef?
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then...
Hi.
What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
Why not?! I'm hungry.
Because they'll know we've been listening.
What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
I love this game!!
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.
I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
Yes, I am!
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Ooooh.
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
I really can't slap you.
You are so beautiful.
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
I love you.
I love you, love you.
So, what do you thing the good news is?
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Are you mocking me?
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
I hope Ben has a little sister.
I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
That was you?
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
I'm sorry, who's this?
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
That's a good call. Right.
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
You don't want to know what tonight was.
Okay. What was tonight?
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Hot dog?
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Hey!
What's wrong Mon?
Oh.
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
And did he?
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
You got all that from saline solution?
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Come on you guys, one more time.
Ok. One.
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
They all had a thing for him.
Aw, Mom...
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
Same category?
According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
That is correct.
The Irish gig guy?!
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
I can't believe it! We're here!
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Come here. Okay, be right back.
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Just a little bit of sugar.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
Oh, you get used to it.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
No.
Yeah! You're the best!
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Hey!
Let's get the show on it!
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Oh, hi Danny.
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
You are?
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
Yeah, swing music is so out.
What are you guys talking about?
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Great. It's gym class all over again.
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Aww.
Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Great.
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
Yeah, totally.
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
That's great. Good for you guys.
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
I've gotta get back in the game.
Why, when did you get out of the game?
Oh no.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Sure!
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
Well no, but um.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
Alright.
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
It's hard for some people!
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Hey!!!
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
OK, try this salmon mousse.
Mmmm. Good.
It's creamier.
Yeah, well, is that better?
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Well it's not flexed right now!
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Oh.
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
And why do you care so much?
You had fantasies about Emily?
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
Excuse me?
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Oh my God!
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Yo- hooo!
Where the hell've you been?
Are you drunk?!
Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
Okay, I love you.
I love you.
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
What?
Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
I know I couldn't. So....
Watch the thorns!
Ow!!
Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
Your a poet and don't know it.
Pick a number! That is your only job!
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
8. 8!
Thank you!
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
And who else is going to be there?
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
Okay.
Break!
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
I'm sorry, who's this?
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
No, there's no dog here?
Who cares? He works in a museum!
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
Yes, yes eight.
Eight! Easy eight.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
I know.
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Here's your girlfriend's button.
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
Okay.
Okay.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
You can not do this.
Do what, do what?
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...
Oh my God! Play!
Really, bitchin'!
Wow, it was so-wow!
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
'Kay, here you go.
What is this?
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
Oh, no thanks.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Yeah, definitely!
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
Man!
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
That's right, she came back all by herself.
Hi!
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
It is so good to see you!
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Are you through with that?
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
He hates me. My nephew hates me.
Can I uh see something?
Cool.
Come on, don't do this.
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
Thanks.
God, what happened?!
Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Yeah?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
That's me! Come on!
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Uh-huh.
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Okay.
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
You should! How is she?
Ohhh!!
Hello! Who's in there?
How ya doin'?
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
How does she do that?
I cannot sleep in a public place.
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Okay.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
Duh-huh!
I can't believe you hated me.
Really?
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
So, what did you guys think?
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Ohhhh...
Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
A wandering?
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Hey, Paul!
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
Noooooooo!!
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Yummy noises.
And Monica, what are you going to make?
Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
"Oh, my, god."
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
We won. We won!
Mr. Heckles.
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Hey!
Hi!
Oh...
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
Excuse me?
I don't know. A month?
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Uh-huh, that one!
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Why would we do that?
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
This is the New York Times.
Okay, may I see the comics?
We are. He's meeting us here.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
You really think that'll work?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Yes, of course they like you!
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Hey!
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
It's, uh, it's Paul.
Who's Paul?
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Oooooh.
Ooooooh.
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Ooh, what do I smell?
I don't know, it smells good.
Ooh!
Please, have some!
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Yeah, yeah!
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Oh my God!
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
No I don't.
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Do either of you have the keys?
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
What happened? Joey?
All right.
They'll never understand!
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
Oh that's great!
Yeah.
Why? What?
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
That's also like the tenth time you told us.
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
Pheebs, did...you want a cookie?
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Can I finish my story?!
Do you want me to pick you?!
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Serious?
Are you scared?
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
Well what happened at dinner?
My God! What did you order?!
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
Hey Erica, c'mon in.
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Uh-huh.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
What?! You slept with Jason?
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I'd cry.
I'm Megan Bailey.
Have you found your dress yet?
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
She's your partner.
Hi. I'm Monica.
Monana?
Yeah. It's Dutch.
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Rachel! You okay?
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Okay!
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
Aah!
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
We need a hat..
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
What?
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
I don't know.
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
So what's going on?
I dunno, there's just something about...
Basically we just feel that he's...
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Okay. Bye!
So, what movie should we see?
What?! Really?!
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?

I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Dr. Burke will see you know.
Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
Then why would he say it?
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Looks like a fun gang.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
That is the most ridiculous.
You sold me out.
We'd be eating our soup right now.
I don't know.
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Mustached bastard...
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
Why? What?
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
And here's little Ben nodding off...
Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Oh, okay!
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
How much longer?
A-A day.
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
Hi Rachel!
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Ahh, third base.
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
We had a characturist!
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Hey, Joey.
Where are they? Where are they?
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Yeah, so did I.
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Oh. Hey, who's Carl?
You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
I'm just making margaritas.
Okay.
What?!
You painting his toenails?
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
Is your tongue swelling up?
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
Is he gonna be ok?
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Okay.
I was kidding.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Sure you do.
You sure?
Uh-hmm.
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
Thank you.
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
Oh! Yeah!
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Uh-huh.
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
Yeah, move over just a little bit.
Keep on scooching.
Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
What's the matter?
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Subtle guys!
What?!
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
Okay. Sorry.
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
What? Mine aren't tinted.
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Pretty much, yeah.
Well, when it's not right, you know it.
You okay?
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Hey! Sugar-O's!
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Y'know I think you can take her.
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
I want a baby.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
All yours.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Shut up.
You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
Very good.
Thank you.
You're gonna do what to my clocks.
I'm gonna set them to my time.
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Aww.
You wanna share it?
Okay!!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
So what's it gonna be?
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Or an uncle...
Hey Phoebe!
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
You do?
You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
Aww!
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
Oh my God!
What do you, what do you think?
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
Ross.
Yeah.
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah, who's playing?
The players.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Thank you!
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
I warned you...
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Yeah.
Okay, see ya.
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
And you're not gonna do that.
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Well..
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Alan.
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
No, sorry.
Well where's Amanda?
I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
Ross, cough drops, please?
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Here!
What's this?
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Aren't you gonna go?
No. Thank you.
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
Oh no.
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
It's Joey's birthday.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante.
Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Yes! .... or no.
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
All right, hang on!
Pass the cheese, please.
Nope.
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
You are? Me, too!
You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Cool!
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
That I was not expecting.
Oh. Thanks.
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
No, they're not.
You're wrong.
I am not wrong.
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Ennnh.
Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
Oh.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Nooo!!
...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
It's Joey.
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
Well, get it off now!
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Oh.
Are you not seeing him anymore?
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Wh-what, why?
We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
Absolutely not.
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
Oh my God.
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
And ice!
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
I got it! Mine!
Hi.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
I know. Thanks.
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
That's too hard. Too hard!
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
No thank you.
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Anybody lose this?
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
You have done enough!
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
Oop, your cake is ready!
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Oh, yeah.
Do we have to make the entire thing?
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
You don't need to fill these silences.
Oh, okay, thanks.
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
What?! Why?!
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh.
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
She lets you borrow them.
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Is there? Is there someone else?
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Hey, big...
Shhhh!
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
Okay.
Sure I do.
Yeah, am I in it?
All right, then show me some manly moves.
Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
All right.
I don't know how to lead.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
OK.
Ross kissed me.
It was unbelievable!
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
What if we have to pee?
I'll cancel the sodas.
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
You're an opthamologist.
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
What?!
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
What're you doing?
I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
Calm down, I'm blow drying.
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
Am I naked again?!
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
That was there when I got here.
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
I love you, Pete!!!
And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Two years.
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
Le Poo's still alive?!
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
It's Le Poo.
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
Nooooo!
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Hey!
Oh, can we read them?
Okay.
Okay.
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Hi Monica.
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Are you all right?
What do we got here?
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
What a pity stay?
Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
No! We only mess around at his place!
Don't come in here!
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
Hey!
Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see.
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Excuse me?
Oh, how bad is it?
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Come on, we can't let them win!
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
So?
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
So?
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
Are you okay?
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
Right.
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
Really?
I can do that.
Then I won't have to kill you.
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
You're on!
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
Ok.
Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
Phoebe's dead.
Hi.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
To the left, to the left- aww!
Ohhh... I'm fine.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Oh, sorry.
I'm Phoebe Buffay.
Well, we both have.
So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
There are?
Yeah! Richard!
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
So, let's go.
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
Nooooo. You're really not going?
Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
Hi.
Six dollars, please.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
I'll get the hat.
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
We really do feel bad about this though.
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
So don't do it.
Monica, relax, go get a beer.
I don't want a beer.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
I'm, I'm still me.
Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
That saves us a conversation.
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
Okay!
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
That's the couch.
Oh my God!
Oh, okay!
Morning!
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
No!
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Paris?
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
So you're free Thursday, then.
Yeah. Oh, can I come?
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
I thought it was $98.50.
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Right.
No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
But you've only slept with two people.
Right.
Now I do.
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Why?
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
So was it a lot more money?
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
Oh my God!
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
I know!!
Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?
Oh, dad, turn it off.
It is off.
It's the off light. Right Ross?
Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
How's the hired help?
What's this? Blue nail polish?
Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Oh.... my... God.
It's not that bad.
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Yeah.
He hates to lose.
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Night Mon. Night Julio.
Adios.
Ah actually, that is mine.
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...
Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Hey!
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Yeah, you wish.
"You wish."
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
What else did you think about?
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Sure you do.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
This is the most special day of our lives.
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
Okay that does sound like fun.
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
Because I promised Mindy I would.
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Well, whaddya think?
Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
Uh-oh...
How-how did that happen?
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
And-and a power tie?
No, pretty much just a towel.
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Aww, there we go.
I love Vegas!
Next time?
Ooh, so close.
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
Ok, that's Eric.
Glad to be of help. Matches.
I don't know.
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
No.
Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Thank you guys-guys-guys...
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Ohh, that is soo sad.
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
Why?!
I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Excuse me?
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Ohh.
...I mean it's my fault.
Oh my God!
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
What?!
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Oh Joey!
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Baking it didn't help, huh?
I tried! They won't take her back.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
You're a little high maintenance.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Hey!!!
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
That was you!
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
I know, but you have to open it today!
Okay.
Wow!
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Don't, I like it dirty.
That's your call.
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Is that a problem?
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
Okay.
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
Pete?!
Why?! What is it?
Oh?!
Yeah, but without the costumes.
How about we play for more money, say 150?
Huh, wanna bet?
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
150 dollars.
Say 200?
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
It's like two miles!
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
We've got to do something!
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Do I ever.
No way!
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
Hey.
So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?
Yeah?
Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
Chandler.
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Joey's a sex addict.
What?!! No I'm not!!
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Fat?!
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Well, apparently she does.
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
What do we got there?
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
You're our third call tonight.
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
You left a shoe here?!
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
Yep, that's my audition.
Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
What?!
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
Call me.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Hey, Monica!
You had sex, didn't you?
How do you do that?
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
I don't know.
Why not?
One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
you don't have insurance?
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
What?
I played bad on purpose guys.
Yeah-no, just that last song.
Hello.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Y'know I think you can take her.
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
Yeah, all right. Ooh!
Joey!
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
No, look, don't touch that!
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
Oh! Yeah!
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Hey Pheebs!
Ohh! You made up!
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
Ohh, get a room.
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
Wait a minute! Take your pants.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
I didn't think I was!
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
Say it.
No.
OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
Say you're sorry.
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
Well, this has been great!
See ya!
Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Come on Rach, let's go.
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Oh, you should here me.
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
No, it's more like a good luck.
So uh, what did this woman look like?
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
Oh that's right!
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
What?
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
Some girl ate Monica.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Oh, you look so great.
So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
Then you do. Heh, heh.
What do you mean?
Y'know, just be there for her.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Are you serious?!
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Okay!
You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
Yeah, me, too, technically.
I had a wedding.
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
Isn't Ben in this?
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Yeah, I'm good.
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
Okay.
Aw.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Yeah, we really do!
Okay.
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
I'm marrying her.
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
That'd be good...
Really?
C'mon give me five more. Five more.
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
And we're changing.
No.
Five more and I'll flash you.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
He's talking to London!
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Hi, honey.
See you later.
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
Oh, that is so sweet!
Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand.
I'll take care of it.
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
God, look what I found in the drain.
What?!
Getting it away from me would be job one.
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Everybody knows!
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
What?!?!
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
What's hard to believe?
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
But I...
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Yeah, that's her.
Thank you.
Y'know what would work?
Hmm?
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Come on, Rach.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
Morning.
Where ya goin'?
Ooooohhhh.
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Almost time for cake.
Mon, Mon, are you OK?
Yeah.
Well, I just caught the live show.
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
What?
Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
Thank you.
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
Hi!
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Waitressing?
Uh-oh.
But, but?
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Nah.
Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
No!
How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
Hey! It's starting to snow.
Gimme the this!
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
Now she sounded breezy.
Monica, you don't know that.
Well, who's voice was that?
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Oh yeah right!
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
He's retiling my floor.
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
He started mine first!
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Come on! Chandler!
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Put your hands together.
No more jam?!
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Okay!
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Great! Thanks.
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Yeah, all right.
Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
They tore it down a few days early.
Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
What? What?
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
You get your messages!
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
Ross? Let's go.
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Wha-what?
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Well, they don't have to know that...
Yeah.
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you?
Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
Yeah, sure. Good luck!
Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
What?
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Hey! How's the boat?!
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Why?
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
Thanks.
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Yes. Yes.
You?! And-and you?!
How?! When?!
It happened in London.
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Hexadrin.
Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
Say what?
Y'know, the possible side affects.
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
What is it?
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Oh, just until the glue dries.
Thank God!
Ah.
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
I got the time to get to know Julie.
I got time.
OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
Well, in a nutshell. . .
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
Monica and Chandler are living together!
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
What's going on?
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Come on! Look where you are!!
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
I won the game.
Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
What's going on?
Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Uh, Joey..
Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks.
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
Hi!
So, you look great.
Right.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Aww.
Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
She's your partner.
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
How do you know?!
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
How did you...know?
Hey! What's she doing back here?
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Her what?
'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
'I drink tea.'
Okay, that's, that's enough.
Won't you dance around with me.
A-ha!!!
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
What?!
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Because it's my apartment!
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
Okay, you are totally making this up.
Oh God.
I've literally never been this happy.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
This is crazy.
Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Thank y...
Girls, sit down.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
... It's a fertility study.
Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Hey.
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!
Yeah!
Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
What was that?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Arghh!!
Hello?
One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Oh my God, what's goin' on?
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
We're not?!
No we're not.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
I, I don't have it.
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
What? What? What?
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
All right, let's do it.
Come on!
This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
An old cookie?
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
We can't accept this.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Absolutely!
Okay. I suck!
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
Hi.
Hi, nice to meet you.
And Joey.
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
Ooh, so close.
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
Monica bang!
Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
Uh.
That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
Good enough to get fired.
All right, you're hired!
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Yeah!
Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Shut-out!!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Yeah, get out!
Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Hi!
Hey, you're back too!
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
Oh, really.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
I'm not arguing with that.
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
It's your joke.
Who did we fight in World War I?
Go ahead.
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Mexico?
Yes! Very good.
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
So the light went out in my refrigerator...
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
Dysprosium.
Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Your grandmother would have hated this.
No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
That sounds like Nana.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Thank you.
Thanks.
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
Yeah.
What's block?
Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
I could do that.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
I forgot my paper.
That was amazing!
That was amazing.
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
Uh, it's the college playoffs.
Oh, then go Vassar.
Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Oh, it ended very well.
Oh.
Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
None.
Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
Well, somebody should.
Look uh, if we're gonna do this...
Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
You don't have birds.
I could have birds.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
All right, bye-bye.
This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
...and this guy...
And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Come on, they're close.
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
No, no, no.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Ewww!
Oh, OK.
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Changes?
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
Is that a problem?
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Chandler!
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Did he call? Did Mark call?
Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
I guess they're back from their date.
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
This is not a sign!
It's an old key!
Oh my God it's old!
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
And did you?!
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
Oh my God.
Hello darling.
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
Oowww!!
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Oh umm, not go.
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
Thank you.
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
A couple of days.
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
Well, they don't have to know that...
Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Here, look, alright, does this help?
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
I know, I took it hard too.
I'm unpacking!
What?!
A small puff of air, now come on!
But your chin here. Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
What?!
Here we go.
All right.
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Yeah! Right!
WHAT IS IT?!
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
What??
No. I am not putting on makeup.
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
Oh yeah! With who?
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
Ah-ha!
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
Hi!
Wow! Skates!
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
How did you do that?
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
You are asking me to be your wife!
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Well you did pull his hair.
He took my snack!
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
What?
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
What are you talking about?
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
My parents will be so happy.
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
What are you doing?
It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
What is that?
I think it's the dying cat parade.
Oh my God!
What?
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
That's right.
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
What??
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
Count for what?
I guess I'm done.
Fun's over!
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Sorry! Sorry.
Arghhhhhh!!
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
All right, I...I have to ask.
What?
What?!
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
You think you know me so well.
Well, don't 'cha wanna?
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
Who wants it? Anybody?
I said I'll do it!
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
What's a Movement class?
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
No.
I really need to talk to you.
Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
I know, it's horrible isn't it?
I just hope...
You can let some of them go by!
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Wh-why is that the best part?
Because then I don't have to!
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Hey!
Hey!
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
A pill?
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
And you're okay with that?
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
Yeah! What are you saying?
What?
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
All right!
Here it is! Here it is!
It's a four.
I think so too.
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
Oh. Oh.
Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Hey!
Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised...
I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
Where have you been?
Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
Yeah, thanks. You know what?
What?
Ohh... OK.
Hey.
We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin.
So, for the whole weekend?
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
What-what are you doing?
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
What?!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
What?
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
Oh my God.
I want to talk to you about your review.
Why? So you could hang up on me?
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
Sounds nice.
No kiddin', hmm.
What?
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Just pickle.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Keep going.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
I love you.
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
So, uh, how's she doing?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
Stay out of my freezer!
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
Oh, I couldn't go in.
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
That, you get? That, you get?
Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Why don't you just get a roommate?
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
What?!
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
That cup is mine!
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
Okay, you're fine.
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
Ohhh, yeah!
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
There's no back to this couch!
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
Um... my... father.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
What?! What are you doing?!
Do you know what just happened?
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
No!
Me too!
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
Done.
Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
Ohh, I thought that you....
Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do? Very nice to meet you. Darling it's the Gellers. Darling, it's the Gellers. She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
Yeah.
Hey!
What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
I did.
And well, what did she say?
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I'd cry.
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Why? Why would you do that?
Ankle.
We'll see.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
What, like there's a rule or something?
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
Hi!
Hey.
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
Wha-what?
What?!
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
I am!
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Oh, thank God!
Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
The players.
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Oh.
Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
Great.
Me too.
Okay.
That's not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Oh my God.
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
How could you lose him?
I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
I don't know. The left one.
Which ones?
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Hi.
No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
Hey!
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
Nice hat.
Thanks.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Can you go any faster with that?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
For an emergency just like this.
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
We owe you?!
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
How desperate am I?
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
How come?
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Why wouldn't they be happy?
What? What? Why?!
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Hi.
Dudes.
Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
No way!
Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
So what's Phoebe like?
I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.
What?
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
I, I know.
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
Ok will do. So glad you came.
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
It's okay...
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Hey.
Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
Men are here.
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
About four hours.
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
Hey, waiter.
Yeah?
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Got me.
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Okay.
So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
I cannot push it in!
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down.
Mar-gha.
Mar-haaaan.
Uh, hello, it's third down.
No it's not, it's second.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
No, no, no.
Uh, uh.
Well?
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late.
And! We also have speaker phone.
Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Which one was that?
Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
What!
I didn't know it was a big secret.
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
And twenty-five it is.
You gave him cookies?
No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Hey.
Is ah, is Chandler around?
Oooh.
Yeah, Ginger something.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
No.
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Oh, great!
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
What are you talking about?
Okay, you are totally making this up.
How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Oh.
Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
What happened?
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
Well...
Get out!
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
Oh no!
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
Jack!
What?! I've never seen one before!
I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
Hello all!
You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Rachel!
What?
Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Aww, thanks man.
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
Time is money my friend?
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
How did you make $17.
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
Did you say something?
No, just singing.
Yeah, but y'know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
May I help you ladies?
Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Of course it was a line!
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
I hate men! I hate men!
Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
Chandler! He's here!
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Hi.
Hi, Alan.
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
Yeah!
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Who got married?!
You did.
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
All right, I'll try not to.
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
So-Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
You have Knicks tickets?
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
Oh we can't, we already have plans.
What are you doing?
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
It seemed like such a simple idea.
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Well, you're not.
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
You totally screwed him over.
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Pheebs...
I just feel so, uhh.....
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
He- he pooped in my shoe.
Which one?
No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Chloe? Hi..
Is this about me taking your watch?
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
You two were married?!
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
We said seven!
We said six!
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Well, thanks.
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
Yeah, it's for our catering business!
I think I know that girl.
No?
No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
That is not true!
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...
Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
Ohh!
All right.
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
We will.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Every year.
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Another hard 8.
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Go! Come on! Roll!
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
What was with the dishes?
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Great, now he's waving back.
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
What do you mean?
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
I don't speak English.
You did a minute ago!
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
A bitch?
Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
Wow!
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
Do I know you?
You used to be my babysitter.
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Great! Thanks!
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
How did that happen?
That yeti is one smooth talker.
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
No! Why?
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Judy.
Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Hi, Joey.
My god, Angela.
Are you gonna go over there?
No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
Nope.
I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
Oh my God!
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
Thanks.
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Did you two...
So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
No.
OK, so now we draw cards.
Oh, good for you!
Congratulations!
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Is this guy great or what?
Yeah, yeah he is.
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Me asking is kind of a sign.
YES!!!!!!!!
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Yeah, so?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
All right? What's going on?
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
You still work at the multiplex?
Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
Brooklyn Heights.
Cleveland.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
You're not gonna mess it up.
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
Hey!
Hey!
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Games and stuff.
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
There's an ad for a naked chef?
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
Okay.
I do not like that woman!
Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
Joey!
Good for you!
No-no.
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
No.
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
What's the charity?
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'
Monica.
Monica bang!
Okay, I heard that.
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Isn't there?
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Hey!
Hi.
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
Give it. Give it.
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
Wow, this really sucks.
Yeah, it sure does.
No, no, there's no rush or anything.
Pizza delivery.
Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it.
We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .
Sir?
What's in it?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
'Kay!
Can I ask you something?
Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Well, I think we all learned something.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
Yeah, so?
And now I've picked it up again.
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Okay no, you do it.
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Man's got a point.
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
Okay.
You have got to go home!
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Which Richard?
The Richard.
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
When did I say that?
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
But what?
She keeps punching me.
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
Oh God, here we go!
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Water rules!
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
What?
For what?
I've gotta get back in the game.
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
Oh, yeah! Right!
Are you guys gonna be okay?
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Did you two...
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Anymore!!
Okay.
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
No, no he's not.
What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Yeah.
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
Is there somebody else?
We didn't change..
So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Monica and Chandler are living together!
I love Jacques Cousteau!
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
And, I came up with Atlantic City.
Which, is the new plan!
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Come on Rach, let's go.
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Hey!
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
What, that little thing at the prom?
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
No.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!


C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
Oopsey, missed it!
I got it!
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
How do you know?!
At this?!
Just go get some! Go!
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
Great.
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
So, do you have any other possibilities?
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway...
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
What? That's not? Oh my God.
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
Hi, thanks for coming in again.
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
Cat hair.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Oh God.
So you guys want me to take this back?
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Big Bird's friend.
He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
What? Oh my God!
What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
Mine? Right here?
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Lovely, just lovely.
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
What're you gonna do?
Just a small tranquiliser.
Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah.
Oh gosh.
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Batman has a utility belt!
007 has a fancy car!
Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
Oh.
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Uh huh. Why is that?
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Uh-huh.
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Oh.
So, how are you doing?
You don't wanna know.
No, I really, really do.
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
What?
What are you talking about?
The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
Well, I hate to eat and run, but...
Yeah, I don't need it.
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Got me.
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Actually, I did!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Are you serious?
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
Oh.
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
Why? Do you have a report due?
I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Was it really that good?
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
5 6 7 8!
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
No. See you don't understand.
Come on.
No that's not true. That is not true.
Oh yeah.
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Aww, man!
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
Dying people say the craziest things.
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Oh, why?
Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
She seems really, really fun!
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Who you what? Who you what?!
Yes.
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
What?
The routine!
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
Was it really that good?
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
Hi!
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
Hi!
Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
Oh-no-no-no-no....
Just one drink?!
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
What?
Oh I just miss him so much!
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
I know it is the best.
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
What are you doing?
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
What?
Hide the Lamp.
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
Okay.
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
You've never met Bob, have you?
No, but he's...
Hey, Joey.
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
Let us keep the apartment and...
Totally worth it!
That was one good minute!
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Uh-huh.
Chandler!
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Ohh, you've waited soo long.
Hey!
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Ok.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
You'll get one.
Oh yeah? When?
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Isn't it a beautiful wedding?!
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
You're his bitch.
No-no!! No!!
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
Hey, you feelin' better?
So, do you have any other possibilities?
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Hi!
What's up?!
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
Aghh.
Me too.
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
Hey, where'd you get that?
I went really long.
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
I'll talk to them!
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
No it isn't, I ate that.
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Ooh, your brother. Score!
What's up?
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
OK, let's do it. What?
And we're changing.
C'mon give me five more. Five more.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Fine! Y'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
Alimony.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
I'm not talking to her!
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
I know, I took it hard too.
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
No!
Are you sure?
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
See you later Mon.
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
Just waiting for you sweetie.
Are you remaking the bed?
Then, you're redoing it because...
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
She's a waitress.
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
The lights, please..
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Excuse me, where are you going?
Uh... to the bathroom.
I want to go to the bathroom.
Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
Ask me what?
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
Come on.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
So...Thank you.
Could you be less enthused?
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
Hi, Chandler.
Oh my God!
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Dude!
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Well, did-did you correct him?
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
I-Ohh!
There you go! There you are!
This is Patrick.
Hi.
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
Uh-huh, yeah that's right.
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
What? You mean behind my back?
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Okay, I'm not getting this!
I'm totally getting it!
What? You just click when they click.
Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
Yeah, that's her.
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
What?
Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
Okay, bye.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
No.
Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
What did he say?
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
Yeah, maybe.
It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
Well?
Nope, not knocked up yet.
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Rossy, Rossy.
She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
Do we have to know about that?
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
What are you saying I should do?
Thank you, Monica.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
Well...
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
Hey!
Hey!
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Oh, So you can move them!
Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
Well there's not much we can do.
Um... unless, unless I use yours.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?
That's insurance fraud.
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Yeah.
Hello!
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
We have got to move!
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
Hello.
Hey.
No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Hey, Rach, how was work?
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
Something wrong?
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
What?!
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Me and Chandler?!
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
Fine!
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Oh.
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
No.
That new mountain bike?
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Whatever.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
Two.
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
Yeah!
And did you notice...?
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Stop it!
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Yeah?
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
Let's get the show on it!
Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Closer than here?
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle.
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
Thanks!
So uh, here's your office set!
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
I can see why that's hard to resist.
I like her so much!
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Ohhhh.
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Huh, wanna bet?
Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
This is beautiful!
Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
I don't know, it looks the same.
You used to have carpet.
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
All right, look at my on the back page.
Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
All right!
I would!
Uh-huh.
Watch, watch.
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Hey Rach.
Hey.
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
I love that movie.
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
No.
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
Well, I guess that's it.
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Well, what is the truth?
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
Do you have any respect for your body?
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
What?!!!
I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Why don't we take it for a spin?
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
Well, at least you scared someone.
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
All right.
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
Did you make brownies today?
Knock, knock.
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
It's Monica's bed. What?
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
What uh-What did you-What?!
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
Oh, was I doing it again?
Yes!
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
There's an image.
Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
Oh. Oh.
Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
What?
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
What? What? What?
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Rachel?
Oh my God!
What are you guys doing here?
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
Hey.
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
Yeah, it is.
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
It's not my first time.
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
Of course.
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Okay.
Okay.
Well, well, you said it was practice!
Then why did you move?!
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
I'm gonna get back to retraining.
All right, see you guys.
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
The one that doesn't.
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
She was a welder.
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
It's not Christmas!
Or Spin the Bottle?
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Nooo!
I know!
What?! We can't do that!
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Hey, I've been honing!
What was with the dishes?
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
What is it doing here?
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Monica! I think Rachel's here!
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Yeah, okay.
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
I know. Hand me a tissue.
You're out of Diet Coke.
What?!
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Are you serious?
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
Aww crap!
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
Why?!
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Well, no. But...
Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
You didn't know that already?
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
The one that doesn't.
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
He's at a dinner party.
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
All right, sorry.
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.
Hey!
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Yeah?
It's nice.
Yes!
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Oh God!
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Not just restaurants, from our house.
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
Hey!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
They had to have that specially made?!
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
It's Danny.
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
The fake kind!
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Oh, no thanks.
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
Yeah! You wanna come?
Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
And then... your face is bloated?
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
You hear that? We're the guys.
We're the guys.
Thank you.
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
Yeah!
You guys wanna eat here?
Yeah! As long as we're here!
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
It went under the table.
All right!
Here it is! Here it is!
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
What did I tell you about the hall?!
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Great.
Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
I know! I know.
Okay.
Hey, did she buy it?
Totally.
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Woooo!!!
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
Hey, I know I what I want!
What we want honey.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Uh-huh, yeah.
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Yeah?
Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Oh. Why didn't you take her?
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...
Nah.
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
Oh.
She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
You're not wearing the patch yet.
I know.
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
Whoa, I'm not done.
Bye-bye.
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Okay, then what happened?
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
No way!
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Got me.
No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."
And why do you care so much?
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
That was a half an hour?
It's your timer.
All right, then massage me up right nice!
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
4:00 A.M.
So, can I get some candy?
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
Good luck! Go get 'em!
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
All right that's it, school is in session!
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Ask me what?
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
Well, I feel like a snack!
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
What?!
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Ok, Mom never hit.
Ok, all done.
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why would we do that?
You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Hey! Sugar-O's!
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
No, we don't.
I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
I highly doubt that.
Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah.
Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Why do you care so much anyway?
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Hello!
Hey!
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Yeah.
The one that always stares at me when I come in?
Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
Okay, I gotta go.
I, but you're so close! No!
Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!
I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Yeah.
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
The one with "Heston" on it.
Interesting.
No thanks, Mom!
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
Ohh.
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
Who cares? He works in a museum!
Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
Ross, the heat!
That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Demi Moore is not a he.
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
Oh. Oh!
Oh my God!
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
How are you feeling?
I really wish that you wouldn't.
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Hey, you guys.
Hey.
Monica, what are you doing?
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
Hi!
Hi!
Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Red Barbra?
Yeah.
Forget it, that's off.
Why?!
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
Oh!
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Divorced men's club.
Potato, Potaato.
Ooh, let's see it!
Ahhh.
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Not now, I'm sick!
Oh come on you big faker!
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Okay, if you really wanna have sex...
All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
No! No, the robots just work for them.
Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
What was the dream about?
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
It-it doesn't?
No!
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
We are looking at a Playboy.
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
He took my joke, he took it.
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
That's a good idea.
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Yeah absolutely!
Yeah.
Excuse me?
Oh! Him.
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
Noo!! Okay!!
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
No-no-no, no!
Oh my God! Look at this!
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
Yes, include more people in this.
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
All right. Mmm-mmm.
Yeah?
No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
Mmm-mmm.
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
Yeah. All right.
You were saying?
What?
We were shopping, and we had lunch.
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Oh, the mixed tape.
You are just the sweetest.
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
Yes it has! I made cookies!
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Okay.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
God!
That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?
Oh! What's new in sex?
Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
How's it gonna be all right?!
Uh-huh, I see that.
What? What?
They tore it down a few days early.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Oh that's not true.
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
No that is the last thing you want to do!
Why?
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
You stop!
Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
No, we don't.
Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.
No.
Give them to me.
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Okay.
We have to get her a present?!
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Okay.
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
I bet 20.
You're right!
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Ew, this feels very weird.
Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand.
Oops.
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
No that's, that's okay.
So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
Oh really?
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
Honey, we gotta go!
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
Yes, include more people in this.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Right here!
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
What, what oh....
Shall we?
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
I think it's necessary.
Wooo!! Hoo!!
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
No, I think you should tell them.
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Defend yourself.
Hmm.
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Hey guys.
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
Is that all?
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
So?
So... they sss-still seem normal.
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
See? It's no big deal.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
What?
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
So, I hear, you hate me!
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
I don't gossip!
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
hey, fella! How you doing?
Aqui est.
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Mira, Mira, el viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop!
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Yay!
Welcome to America.
Yay! Emily!
What are the odds? What are the odds?
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
What?
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Are you okay?
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
Oh sweet Moses.
Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh?
Nice.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Yeah?
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
Are we still on that?
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Pete.
Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
What?!
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
Okay, okay. I hate this.
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Why?
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Take care.
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Hello?
Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
It's Alan.
Chandler! He's here!
Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
Hi.
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
Oh!
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Yes!
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Not now, I'm sick!
Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
Where are you from?
Bakersfield.
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
How come the writing is in Spanish?
Don't read my condoms!
Who are you saying "check" too?
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Ow!! Ow!!!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
It's like two miles!
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
In the game room!
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Excuse me?
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
No, we only went out once.
You dated her!
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
Surprise!!!
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
Is this yours?
Well actually...
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
Because we won our apartment back!
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Oh, good. Thank you.
Dear?
Just the matter of ...payment?
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
Yes?
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
Like what?
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Who? Is that your sister?
Ugh, she is a slut!
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
He's taking off her coat!
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
What's a virgin?
Water it is.
You mean the spitter?
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
Are you ok, Ross?
I don't know. What's in this pie?
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
Periodontist.
Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
Ditto.
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
That's Bill Clinton.
Who's he huggin'?
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
We use it!!
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
There's only one.
Monica.
Rachel. Hey.
Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Go!!
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Oh!
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
That is funny.
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Oh yeah. See you guys.
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Oh my God!
Oh-ho, okay.
Dead leg!!
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Oh, right, right, shut up.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
The Richard.
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
Me too!
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
What-why?
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Hi, pig!
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
Yeah.
Hey!
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
I am the best.
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Why?
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Hey! It's 42-21!
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Yeah.
Yes, every single one of them.
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
You never run on a barge!
Hey.
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
What's fish hooking?
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Y'know what? You are right?!
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
How'd he take it?
Pretty well, actually...
Oh, do I?
Uh huh.
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Oh...
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
That's right.
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
That's a little more than I wanted to see.
Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
Eh! There you go.
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!
Really?!
Do you wanna?
Hey.
Hey.
..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
So, Monica, how's the ankle?
It's uh...
You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
That is so unfair!
Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Why not?
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
All right, fine.
Monica! Come on!
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
What?
Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Uh-huh.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
I'm gonna do it too!
Me too!
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Whaddyou want?
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
No!
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! Huh?!
What's your favourite thing about summertime?
Yeah...
Hey!
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Hey!
Okay.
Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Pheebs, what are you doing?
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
Okay, everybody hold!
Next on the platforms are... ...you two! And... ...You two!
Monica! Would it?
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
Well what happened at dinner?
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Yeah!
Refill?
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.
Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.
And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
Hello.
Hey!
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
I used to love to play restaurant.
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
Oh please, a relationship.
Really?
Yes.
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Unless!
Unless what?
Like what?
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Oh, god help us.
What?
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
We're 29, we're not women.
Okay, I'm hearing.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
That is true.
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
Okay.
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
Oh, I totally agree.
What?
Nothing. Nothing.
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Hey!
Hi!
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Yes!
No!
Really?
Yeah!
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Very good Monica! You know where they are.
I sure do! And you don't get one!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Yes!
Yay!!
Noo!
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Uh-huh!
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
She is a kook.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
Just uh, do the right thing.
What?
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
Oh, I totally agree.
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
How many?
Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
So'd you guys have fun?
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Do you realize you get louder each week?
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
And the video camera?
Uhh, Monica?
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
What?!
Hey, here's a thought.
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
No! Shhh!
What you got over there? Tacos?
Uhh, those are tacos.
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
You do?
That and arrogance.
Hey.
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Um-hmm.
Oh honey, I'm sorry.
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Hi Joey's sisters!
Hey!
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Wait, just a second.
Okay. Oh! Oh no.
Oh good, you're all up.
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Oh my God, they took my idea!
That was you?!
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
Oh my God!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
I know!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
I can't do it!
Now you do that, you're on TV.
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Really? I've heard better.
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
You found me a guy?
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
I guess that's how.
Hey Monica, how's it going.
Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Certainly.
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
God. You seem really, really nice.
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
dammit!
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
Yeah, but y'know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
May I help you ladies?
Yes, what's the name, please?
Emily Waltham.
Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Dr. Burke, it, it's me.
Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great.
Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
I've been great, just great. How have you been?
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
I am not.
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
So. You two are totally into each other.
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
That's what you think.
Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
What was her name?
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Umm, yeah.
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
Ok. He kept my dollar.
Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
Well, you know Chandler.
Maybe you changed?
I didn't change!
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
I really need to talk to you.
Well, then talk!
Yes!
What thing?
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Hmm.
OH...MY...GAWD!!
Ohh, Nothing.
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Really?
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
They have parasites?
What people?
People! People say it! Come here!
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
Why?!
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
Psss, that is whack!
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Ohh! Hi!
Hi!
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on!!
Uh-oh.
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
Hey!
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
It was a dry day.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Oh my God.
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
You OK?
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Yeah, it's in there.
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Hi!
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Chandler.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Ohh, Nothing.
I know what it did! Nothing.
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
What about me?
I think you may have a drinking problem.
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?
Oh... shoot.
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
Oh yeah.
Whoa, I'm not done.
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Oh. Oh my God.
Yeah, right. Sure!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
Hey!
Hey!
It's Joey.
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
He's really picky about his patients.
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Yes!!
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
Huh.
I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing.
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
I'll be waiting.
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Sure, do whatever you want.
Yeah?
Look at this.
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
What, he's 18.
Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
I would really love it if could do both.
All right, I...I have to ask.
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Really?
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
Hi.
This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Ah!!
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Goodnight.
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
My parents are dead.
I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
Alright.
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
That thing is not coming in here.
'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
I know.
Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking.
Chandler.
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Okay, okay, what's going on?
Okay, they're just talking...
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
Ok will do. So glad you came.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Oh ok.
Happy birthday sweetie.
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Chandler!
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Okay.
Really?
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
What?
Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
What?!
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
Really?!
Yeah!
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
Is this true?
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Is all this true?
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
What is it?! What about Pete?
I don't know!
I can't!!
Okay, I gotta go.
Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
Oh, god help us.
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Hey, how'd it go?
Excellent.
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Oh! I used to do that too!
Aw, Mon...
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Maybe.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
Youre doing it again.
I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep.
You dont even have cats.
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
You just thought of that in there?
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
You're on the phone!
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
Oh honey, but it is just about...
It is! It is!
What?!
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Do I dare ask?
That sounds great. Same for me.
And for the gentleman?
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Well, who's voice was that?
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Okay, hating this.
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
All right, I'm going. I'm going.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
Oh.
Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
No. But I remember people telling me about it.
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
I ate a bug.
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
Oh, now you want a favour?
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Last time I do that, I promise.
Who was that?
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
In a bad way?
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
My Giant? I love that movie!
You really think this is okay?
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Yeah?
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
Yeah.
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
All right. Good luck.
Thanks.
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
About what?
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Yeah baby!
Hey!
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Is Joey here?
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
He could hear me.
OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Excuse me. Hi.
Hi.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
I'm off the list.
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
And Monica knows...
Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
So what's it gonna be?
Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
Well, what'd you do?
I did it anyway.
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
Ok.
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Well, Mon, I was married.
Yeah, me, too, technically.
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
What are you gonna do?
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
I had one.
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
Uh-huh!
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
What?!
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Monica? You're Mom.
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Could not be more terrified.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Waitressing?
Uh-oh.
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
You really think this is okay?
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Okay!
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
That bitch!
Monica! What...
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
No, that's not mine.
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Oh, good. Thank you.
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Hi!
Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
Well you should be embarrassed.
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Yeah, I heard it.
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
And that's not against your oath?!
No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
Thank you, Joey.
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
And did you?!
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Huh. That's nice.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Need some help?
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
Oh, hello liar.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
What do you mean?
I think it went into me.
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
Ok, who ordered what?
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
Huh.
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
No way!
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
Um, this?
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Ohh!
I'm so sorry you're sick.
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
What?
All yours babe.
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
Really?!
What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
I don't know.
That's what you said last night.
Okay.
Really Joey?
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Stop it!
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Op! We gotta go!
Oh, where are you guys going?
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Fifteen minutes.
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
What else?
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Yeah.
That's true!
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
And I will see you tomorrow!
That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Why?
Ohh, so?
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!

There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
That's not European!
Well, it felt French.
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
You are just like Jack.
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
Is that some kind of boat talk?
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Uh, yeah.
Why?
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
What?!!
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
He hates me. My nephew hates me.
Come on, don't do this.
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.
I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Oh.
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
Thanks Monica!
Does that smell bother you?
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Don't blame the questions!
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
Yeah, what is it?
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Central... Park!
Yeah, all of us! All day!
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
How are you?
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
That I was not expecting.
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Okay!
Okay.
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Yeah, it's just y'know...
Monica said wedding.
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
Okay. I'll be right there.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
We're the Bings.
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Why haven't you told them?!
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
That's great! That's wonderful!
Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
Hey.
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Oh that's great!
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
So, can I get some candy?
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
Um-hmm.
Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
What the hell happened?!
I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"
And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
What kinda things have you been saying?
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
I do like that.
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...
Nothing. Nothing.
No-no really, was-was that not okay?
Oh my God! It didn't remind you of...
Don't say it!
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
Okay.
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
Sure.
Where are we?
Just tell me the truth.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
What, that little thing at the prom?
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
Hey.
What is ah, Rach in her room?
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
Okay, bye.
I'm sorry things didn't work out...
Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto.
Hola, Joey!
Hola, amigos!
Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
Hey, guys.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
Hey guys!
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Really?!
Ross is Batman!
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Oh, hey let me.
Of course I did.
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
Hi.
How's it going?
Fine, whatever.
What's the matter?
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Okay, I'll do it!
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
What the hell is that?
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Something to remember me by!
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Oh, well thank you in advance.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Hey guys!
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
It's a legitimate learning technique. Wow!
Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy.
Need some help?
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Count for what?
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
I'm off the list.
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
What? It's still going on.
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Oh, you're...
OOooooo!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Yeah.
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
Was he crying?
No.
Maybe.
I think so.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--
Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
Okay.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
That's closer.
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
What's that on the bottom?
Hello.
Hey, honey.
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Why to save your dignity my man.
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
How many beeps?
She answered.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
Hey! Hi!
No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
So the light went out in my refrigerator...
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Noo!!
Yes!!
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Really?! You promise?
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
Your a poet and don't know it.
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
Mine? Right here?
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
Then you do. Heh, heh.
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Hey! I call her!
"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
You dated her!
Not once!
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Really?!
Okay!
No drops!
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
You made pottery?
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
What?
But I can't tell you.
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Woah!
Hi you guys.
Hey.
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Great! Thanks!
Okay.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
I ran!!
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
Joey!
I know, here-here!!
Hi!
Hi!
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Hi Chandler.
Hey!
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Another hard 8.
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
True story!
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Thank you.
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Right?
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
Congratulations!
Oh that's great!
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
All right. I'll get my bag.
Good.
So you want to come inside?
Yes. Yes I do.
Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
Why? So you could hang up on me?
Just give me a chance too...
Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Well, if you think it will help.
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
What the hell is in there?
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
That's my pie!
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
Ooh, God it looks bad.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
He's really picky about his patients.
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
What?!
What is the emergency?!
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Thank you.
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
Nothing. No, nothing.
I was going to call him, but...
I'd really rather talk to him.
Oh.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
What? I didn't say anything.
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
How who wears it?
I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
You wanna buy a car?
No.
Ohh...
What's the matter? You okay?
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Okay.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
Oh, it's like a skit.
Whoo!
Cool.
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Yeah, it's great.
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Nooo...
How about Joey... Pepponi?
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
Some of your old stuff.
Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Oh, God forbid.
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Wait! What about Joey?
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
This is disgusting!
I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
you don't have insurance?
Why, how much is this gonna cost?
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
Well there's not much we can do.
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
You hear that? We're the guys.
We're the guys.
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
Hey!
Okay!
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Okay!
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
All right? What's going on?
Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
Sir! No sir!
All right, you!
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
Done! With time a-to-spare.
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Ahoy!
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
I guess it was kinda funny.
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
No, I am.
I do?
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
It's hard for some people!
Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Surprise!!
What?
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Hi, sure!
Hi.
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Okay.
Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Why did you hire me?
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.
Okay, I didn't hear that.
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
I think you smell great!
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Hey!
How'd it go?
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Cat.
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
I'm fine, thanks.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Okay.
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
I know what it did! Nothing.
Like this.
Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Thanks Chandler.
I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Yes!
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Try telling my wife that.
Okay to come in?
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
What?!
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Um-hmm.
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
We have got to wash that!
Yeah!
You have done enough!
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
Oh, okay!
No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
Sure.
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
You really sure?
I'll call you back.
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
Really?
Ehh.
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
No. I am not putting on makeup.
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Kinda. They're really big.
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
Ok, here, watch this.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
No, not us... Us!
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
It doesn't say that!
Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
Cat!
Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Marcel?
My uncle Marcel.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
The second sister dies?!
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
That's correct.
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Nu-uh!
Oh, an old glove?
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Me too!
I don't want things to change! Do you?
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Yeah. Where were you?
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Nah. I kept myself busy.
Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
Crazy.
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
She sent the chicken back again?!
She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
Lucky bastard! Janice.
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Would it really have been that easy?
Yes!!!
Hey! What's up?
Hey!
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Alright, somebody.
Whoooaa!
That's my sister.
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
Oh my God. He threw up?
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Hey guys.
Hey Danny.
Thanks, Mon.
Well, of course.
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
So, how was your date?
Um-hmm.
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
No! No!
Okay.
Exactly.
Hey.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Isn't this great?
Hmm.
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Are you okay?
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
Hello.
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Sure I would!
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
I didn't know there were docks.
Hey.
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Right this is staging.
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
Thanks.
Bye!
No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
So what are they doing?
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
What're you doing?
Just waiting for you sweetie.
Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
You didn't get the money, did you?
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
Come on along and listen to...
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Chandler! Is he?
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
007 gets all the ladies.
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
Actually, I don't like martinis.
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Dude, we were good!
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Hey!
Hi!
OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker.
Excuse me, where are you going?
You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Uh huh.
We ended up having sex in his chair.
You-you had what?
Sex in his chair.
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
NO!!!
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
Come on!
What happened? Joey?
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Yes, but there isn't always time!
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
Unless...
What?
Yeah, I'd really like that.
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Yeah, you do.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Are you serious?
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Well, either that or uh...
Joey!!
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
We've got presents!
Good ones?
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Feelings, such strong feelings.
Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
I'm just trying to spice it up!
Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
Oooohh that's interesting.
Hey, no way, that rooster's family!
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
I don't know.
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
What are you gonna do?
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Fine.
Fine.
Chandler!
Yeah?
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Wow! This looks great!
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Oh, just until the glue dries.
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
No!
Quick! What time is it?!
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yeah?
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
What?!
I knew it!
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
Okay. But wait!
What?!
Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
Oh.
Yeah, um, may we help you?
No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!
Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Did she just ask me out on a date?
I don't think so.
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
Too strong for me?
Yeah.
Oh fine.
Ready? Wrestle!
Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Oh my God! Look at this!
I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
So. You two are totally into each other.
OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
Yes. Right where?
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
And the sex?
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Hi!
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Yeah, it's good.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Let's give it a shot.
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
No, just a Friday night.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
I'll help you dial.
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
Does Joey know?
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Chandler!
Monica.
Okay, fine, $300.
300 dollars?!
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
Well, my goodness, what was that?
You thought I was Rachel?
Yes because uh, you look so young.
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Yeah, come to papa.
I know!
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Monica?
What?!
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Oh my god.
What?
Come on, they're close.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Pheebs, I was wondering...
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
What were you doing in Africa?
Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
I don't know.
There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
Well, you're not working either.
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
You do?!
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
You thought about that?
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
It's lovely to meet you.
So are you his mother or his father?
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
Nice to meet you.
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Chandler!
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Who?
Marcia and Chester.
Hmm.
Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
This is my wedding.
Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
No, I knew.
All right.
What?
What?
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Yeah?
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
Hey, are we still on for tonight?
Yeah.
No! No boom-boom before big fight!
How 'bout just a boom?
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
I know, but look at me all tan.
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Chandler what do you say?
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
I was talking to myself! You're going down!
You're straight. I get it.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Why not?!
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
Did you like it?
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
Kick save and... denied.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
So. How'd you guys meet?
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
A wandering?
Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
You're the twinkie?
She's not a twinkie.
Oh please, a relationship.
Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
Okay. That was her right?
Definitely.
Yay!
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
Phoebe moved out.
Right.
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Well, I think so.
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
I hope it's you.
Me too!
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?
Yay!
I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
I guess.
Oh my God!
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Yeah, whatever.
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
I could die.
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
Like what?
Cups.
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
What were you modeling for?
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Ahh.
Do you love her?
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Uh-oh, it was bad?
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
I can check that for ya.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Yeah, what's that about?
All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Well, what do you mean?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Well, that's cool. So did...
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Well, she saw the ring.
Did she freak out?
Right.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
Everything you've heard is true.
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
Um
Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Well, you're not.
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
I'm all better now.
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
H-He's in China!
The country.
What about the time difference?
From here to the airport?
Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Please, have some!
Oh, yumm!
Wow! The new Playboy!
Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Oh, it's my new beeper.
What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Know when to stop.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Right!
I think you're my favorite.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Awww. But still no.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
That was amazing.
No, you're the best.
No, you're the best.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
I blame London.
Bad London!
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Only here.
That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
And Mindy, your maid of...?
Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
What?
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Oh!
We have got to start locking that door!
Nope.
That's because I'm in front of them.
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
Oh that's so great!
I know!
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
I'm not macho.
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Had it.
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
All right, here we go.
Okay.
I really can't slap you.
You are so beautiful.
Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Huh?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.
No, they're not.
Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
I know.
Oh, Chandler funny?
Our guy's a great dancer!
That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
What?!
God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Oh no!!
: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh...
: We have apple cinnamon...
Wow!
What?
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Fine, I'll go call her.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Wow! This looks great!
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
And now you'll see me buying it.
Look, you don't want to fight me.
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
What?
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
Hey!
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
What what what what?
Ya think?
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
Oh...
"Happy Birthday Peehe."
Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
Hey, what's going on?
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Hey.
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Kinda. They're really big.
What?
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
Hello.
Hey Mon!
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
You're not on TV.
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Are you serious?
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
Joey!
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Yeah, okay.
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
That's not gonna work.
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
College?
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
What?
Oh, I can't pass for 22?
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Hey guys.
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Ohh, yeah.
Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
And also, we don't know what to do with this.
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
It's okay...
Two years.
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Oh!
Please!
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Oh, now I have to go!!
What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!!
Hormones!
Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
Sooo?
Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
I feel terrible, I really do.
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Yes.
It's that terrible?
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Howdy partner!
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
About what?
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
All right.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
That was a half an hour?
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
I make the decisions, and I say no.
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
Well...
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
Then free as a bird. What's up?
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Well, did-did you correct him?
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
What?!
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
No, just a salad will be fine.
You got it.
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Okay, what's going on with you?
Nothing! You go!
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
So-so there is no party.
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
Exactly.
Ross?
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
You.
Really?
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
I think that's gum.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
Let it go, Ross.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Neither am I.
Hey, there.
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Do you want my pickle?
Hey guys.
Well, he's very charming.
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Ohh!
I'm so sorry you're sick.
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
I have not been sick in over three years!
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
Hi Janine!
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
Yeah, that's what I said.
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
Yeah.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. It's a joke.
Bye.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
I don't get this! She was horrible!
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Well then why can't I see it?
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Really?
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Why did you hate me?
And that wasn't fun for you?
Duh-huh!
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
Well, I was having a conversation.
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
That would be great. Thank you.
Hello!
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Ohh.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Something to remember me by!
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Not so good.
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
And?
Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Really?!
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Hmm?
Did-did you take these back?
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
I loved them!
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Okay.
What was tonight?
You don't want to know what tonight was.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
You call that delicious?
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
Ok, just one more point.
Score! Now can we go?
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Really?
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
Ugh.
Oh my god.
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
Ooohhh.
I know.
Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
Yeah.
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Okay no, you do it.
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
You really think that'll work?
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
...hormones, yeah.
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
It's morphin time!
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
And was the curse lifted?
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Can I see you for a second?
Once!!
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Please, can't you help me out?
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Then all your stuff would be here.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
Does it have to do with Joey?
No.
No, but let's come back to that later!
There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
Hey guys!
Hi!
I don't know.
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
What are you gonna do?
Okay.
Break!
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Men are unbelievable.
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
I don't get it.
No, I have faith...
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
Sure.
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
Aghh.
He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
Ohh.
Well then definately don't take his name.
Pete?!
Why?! What is it?
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Maybe on some level.
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
I can't remember which sister.
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
How can you not know which one?
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Great!
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
I think you're better than you think you are.
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
Are you pregnant?!
Um-hmm.
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
Here's your key
Oh thanks.
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Ready!
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Hmm?
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
That's, that's nice twice!
Duh, where've you been?
Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
So we're back on?
We're back on.
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
Wow! Just like in the pros.
Huddle up.
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Wait! What about Joey?
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Oh my God!
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
There you go.
Yep.
Which?
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
I couldn't do it.
Good for you, Joey.
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Oh my God!
I bet it was about her a little.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
I am proud of all my friends today.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
We learned how to dance.
Yeah!
Hey! You're a good dancer!
Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
You can let some of them go by!
Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
Okay.
I do. I do. I do.
...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Define fun.
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
That's probably what they'll say.
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Yeah.
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
Oh that would be great!
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Hey!
Hey!
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
No.
Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
Agghhh.
So were you in Nam?
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Ohh, so?
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Hey!
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Yeah, you do.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Nooo!
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Hey!
Hey! What's up Mon?
Have at it.
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Who are those people?
Got me.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
What is that?
Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
Plus, you look cool.
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Really?
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
Yeah?
Yeah.
All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
What's that on the bottom?
Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
I bet he can.
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
Ohh! My God! Barry!!
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Ugh!
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Your messages have been erased.
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
No.
No, it's really good.
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.
Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
Mr. Treeger.
Uhh, you said there was a party.
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
Does that smell bother you?
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Okay!
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
I guess I'm done.
Fun's over!
Uh-huh!
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
God, I hope they kick his ass!
Honey, I'm sorry.
May I help you?
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
You guys! You guys!
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
All right, what's going on there?
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
We're switching rooms again.
What? Why?
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Texas?
That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Yeah!
That really is something; that's really cool.
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
Uh, may I help you?
Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Or so I would have you believe.
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
Alright, go on.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
What? Ow!
All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
Yes! Did you see that?
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
No.
No.
Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
But we've only had one job.
Yeah! What are you saying?
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Really?
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
G'night.
Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Two.
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
That's cool.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
Okay.
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Okay!
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
Really?! Are you sure?
Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Really?!
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
Claws?!
No.
No!
What is it?! What about Pete?
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
What?!
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Hey, here's a thought.
Monica, what are you talking about?
Ahh, third base.
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
He's taking off her coat!
Oh, this is just terrible.
Oh.
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
Tho?
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
So um, who was she?
Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Well, you seem fine.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Bye! Thank God
Dude, what'd you have?
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
Uhh, 9.
But it's dark out.
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?
No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Not really.
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
WHOAA!!
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
What?
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
Why?!
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
That's true.
I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Okay. Here's the thing.
Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What's the thing?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's-that's what you're worried about? If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
Huh?
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
And that's how you bought it?
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
Hellooo!
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Nooo!!
Yes!!
Why is your family Ross?!
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.
Oh, you're a grandpa.
Yeah. Are we nuts here?
I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
Yeah.
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Oh, I already have one.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Any time you're ready, Joey.
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Hey!
Hey, Pheebs!
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
No.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
So, that's it?
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
Why not her?
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
I wish all guys could be like him.
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Hi.
Hi.
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Come on! I really need your help!
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
I've got Ben.
Because, because I've got Ben.
He's at a dinner party.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
What?!
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Oh and you know what I want!
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
But I already gave them back to you!
No you didn't.
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
I know!!
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
They have the best stuff in there.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Oh?
Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
I guess you can.
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Hey!
Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
What?!
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Oh my God!
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
-leg?
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
Yeah! Oh yes!
Ohh.
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Totally!
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Hey, it's good to see you!
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Well, my nose got lonely.
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Right.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
That's okay.
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
Is it true they have beer?
Everything you've heard is true.
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
Um
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
Yeah.
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
I don't know.
Me neither.
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Really?
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Uh-huh.
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
No-no, let me in!
Phoebe?
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
Nevermind.
"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
Yeah, that's what I said.
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Whoa! Don't know about that.
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
Thank you.
That's fine.
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
That bitch!
Monica! What...
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
It's Fun Bobby.
What, isn't he sober?
Ohhh, OK.
Alright, here you go, sweetie.
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
And cut!
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
You have no trouble telling time now right?
Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Nooo...
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
Definitely her.
Yeah.
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
Are you really not going?
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
If you wanna call that a reason.
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
I know!
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Oh.
Huh!
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
What? That's like insanely easy!
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
I made you a surprise.
Oh yeah?
Did you not understand the story?
Hey!
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Monica Gellerrr.
Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
Just please stop!
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Would you excuse me for a second?
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!
Ross, he's got the remote again.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
So it's okay to date a student.
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Okay!!
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Uh-huh, that one!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Your mother told you this?
Yes!
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
A mirror?
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Cache? Jaunty?
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Are you still awake?
Yeah! You?
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
You're not an artist.
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Pheebs, how's it going?
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Oh-I don't know.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Oh really?
Who is it?
Edward Nevski?
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
You were trying to eat it!
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
I can not believe your trading me!!
Are you gonna let me play?
All right then.
No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
No, I think you should tell them.
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
Alright, shall we?
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Well, then can we meet him?
Nope. Schhorry.
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Oh, that is so sick.
Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be.....
Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Yeah.
What?
Umm, you've got some on your pants.
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Um-hmm.
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
What gave me away?
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
No.
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
Oh, yeah!
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
You're strict.
It's for their own good.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
Hey!
Hey.
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Really?
How about Mockolate mousse?
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Deal!
Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
I'm sorry but...nothing.
What?
Honestly? Me too.
Really?
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
What are you doing?!
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
What the hell are doing?!!
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Half full of looooovvvvve.
Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Mustached bastard...
Excuse me...
Good evening.
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
Oh.
Hey!
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
It was you?
Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Hi Chandler.
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Come on, we can't let them win!
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
Later!
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Yeah, it is the best.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Yeah, I can do that.
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
What a sweet story.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Really?
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Tell her what?
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Joan?
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Not broad backed!
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Hey, Mon, what is this?
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
How could you tell her?!
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
Phoebe, wait a minute!
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Even with me?
Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Hey!
Nope.
No? What happened, big guy?
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
That-that's bad?
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
Because we can remember them.
Well, sure, that too.
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
What?
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Yeah, you're on your own.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
Give me that.
OK.
Hey.
So uhh, how's the palace?
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
No! Oyster?
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
I do like that.
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
But you told them you weren't?
That's right.
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
I know a great little place.
You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that.
Why, how much is that?
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Really?
Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
Hey!
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Absolutely.
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
I was afraid of that.
Know what I mean?
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
Ahhh! Ooh, nice!
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
Oh my God!
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
You like it right?
Yeah, come here!
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Thanks.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
Hey.
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
You got it! Oh-oh!
What are you doing?!
Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Do not speak ill of the dead.
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
What did you say?
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
I am!
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Yeah.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
The Ice Capades?
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
What?
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
They'll never understand!
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
I was in too much pain.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
I think he's shy.
Yeah?
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Happy birthday!!!
Happy birthday!!!
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
Waiting for candy.
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
We want candy! We want candy now!
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Oh, the mixed tape.
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
I'm starving!
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
Please! I made this game what it is.
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
What equity investments?
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
You don't even have a car!
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
Yeah, it sure is!
They have parasites?
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Hey, where is everybody?
They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
Okay.
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Oh right, right.
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
I'll have whatever Christine is having.
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
I love that idea!
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Aww.
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
What's that?
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
You're kidding! Where? Where?
Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
Chandler! Chandler!
Hi.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
What?! I just touched him and he went over.
So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
You used to have carpet.
Oh yeah!
Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
What? What's wrong?
I, OK....
Alright.
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Joan?
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
Mockolate.
I'm sorry?
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Yeah?
Yeah!
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
I used to love to play restaurant.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
Just some stuff for the party.
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Oh honey, I'm sorry.
Ohh! That's so great!
I know!
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
All right, come here!
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Monica! Stop it!
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
Pete's breaking up with me.
What?!
And?
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
Yeah, Ginger something.
Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
Well, what did you do?
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
A test?!!
What are you doing?
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
I haven't seen him in so long!
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
It's almost as if he knew.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
I don't gossip!
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
What? They were like this!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Nothing.
Come on, tell me.
Oh, I promise, what.
It's Richard Burke.
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
All right.
Thank you!
It was, it was her voice.
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
Frozen lasagnas?
Um-hmm.
No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Okay, this one I like!
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?
I know the code to his answering machine.
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Must pee.
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
This is so much fun!
This is not fun!
Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Really?
So, Monica, what do you do?
Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Yeah, that's true.
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
No. No, you're not a loser.
Look at me!
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
Well...
I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
You put your fist through the wall?
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Fine with me!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
Excuse me?!
Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
There he is! There he is!
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
Who's this from?
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
I have some moves.
Yeah, let's just forget it.
What if I turn out the lights?
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Huh?
You said no right?!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
I know.
It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Hey, the man's dog just died.
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Uh, plate?
Plate! Yes, plate.
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
What?
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here." Though some things don't change.
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Yeah.
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Anybody gonna eat that?
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
I promise.
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.
Hey!
You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Um, cake.
Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.
Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
Bobby.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...
And you?
I thought it was... quite tasty.
A bitch?
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Oh.
Yeah baby!
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
Not fun anymore?
I'm still hungry!
I am!
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
All right, so what were you thinking?
Ohh! No.
Why not?
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Really?
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
I know, it's great!
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
Hey, you're right.
Yeah.
Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Come on, they were not that huge.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
You or me?
Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
You have dinosaur checks?
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?
Hey, Mon, what is this?
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Still crying?
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
What's the other one?
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
Hey, Monica!
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Why?
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Was it not pain-free?
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
I can not believe your trading me!!
Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
"See you around?"
Well, what do you want me to say?
Alright, I'll call you.
I don't think you mean that.
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
What?
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Oh, okay!
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
Ya think?
No, was he any good in it?
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
For what?
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
What, like a number?
Hey!
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
All right.
Hi.
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
Okay.
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
You need to give him money.
Give him money? It was a joke!
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
I want the little round waffles.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
We have got to wash that!
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Hey, you know about that?!
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Y'know, the possible side affects.
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Why?
In case it happens.
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
Can I use your phone?
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Maybe she never got your message.
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
What were you doing in Africa?
Working with blind kids.
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
Okay!
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
I'm sorry..
Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Okay no, you do it.
What?
We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
He does?
Say again?
Feelings, such strong feelings.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
That's me! Come on!
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
A face ass?
A chin dimple!
Have you seen your guy's body?
No, our guy is just a floating head.
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
Like a pirate?!
If that helps you.
I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
Gimme this.
Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
People! People say it! Come here!
So oysters, huh?
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
No.
Ahh.
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
Please.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
Yeah.
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
Goodnight.
Mmm. Oh, no-
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Ok...ay.
I just had sex.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
You tired Chandler?
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Really?
All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
All right.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Thanks!
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Yes, it was!
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Why?
I have my reasons.
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
Wow... Wow!
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!
Oh. Oh.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Flexible hours.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
He took my joke, he took it.
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
Just tell me the truth.
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
Where's that?
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Not any more.
Really?!
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
And did you?!
But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Oh my God.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
No, not my touchie.
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Work on your music?
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?
He'll be here OK, take a chill pill.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Oh, you get used to it.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
For what?
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Thank you!
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Lebanon.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
I-kea! This is comfortable.
This place is amazing.
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
A test?!!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
Hey.
No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Yeah?
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
Or so I would have you believe.
No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Lebanon.
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
But Mon, you have to get our money!
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
What?
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
It's me, Carl.
C'mon up.
Seven hundred bucks!
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
How?
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Keep going.
You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Eh! There you go.
Oh, ew!
What?
Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!
No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
Monica?
I guess that's how.
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Does that mean Carcass is available?
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
How?
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
Rachel always cries!
That's not true!
All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Go!!
You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Ohh, that is soo sad.
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
Listen if you wanna go, just go.
No, she'll yell at me again.
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Yeah, right. Sure!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
That is not true!
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Nice car!
Yeah, it's not mine.
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
You have got to go home!
But I like it here!
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Great!
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
I'm gonna set them to my time.
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
Keep talkin'.
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
Like a hound?
Not a basset, a bassinet.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
I'm sorry, who?
But we don't know the neighbors.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
He just said, "No strippers."
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Little village people.
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.
That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
Fine.
Sorry.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
See.
OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
You are so smitten.
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
Hey guys! Hey!
Hey.
That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Not at these prices.
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
Get my glasses too.
All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
What? I don't see anything.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
I'm just taking you outside!
Oh, okay.
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
You're so efficient. I love you!
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
It's almost as if he knew.
Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on.
Hi Emily!
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
What?! Ow!
Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Hey.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
That's not a question.
But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Ah!
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Oh, from who?
From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Oh, why?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
That's not funny.
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Who is it?
It's me, Carl.
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Noooo.
What?!
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Yeah, I'd really like that.
Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Ethan?
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Why haven't you told them?!
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
That was a terrible throw!!
I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
Yeah, I think we are.
This isn't even my dress.
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
What is wrong with you?!!!
What?!
So you didn't mean any of that?!
No you robot!!
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
Sure.
Cassie?
Uh-hmm.
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
You let Joey drive it?!
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
So are you ok?
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
Yeah, well they suck too.
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Why not?
'Cause it's gross.
Really?!
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Good for you!
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Yes, but you are dead inside.
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
You don't even have a car!
And?
And six others.
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I do?
Okay.
Or not.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Hi!
Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
What happened to uh, MEG.?
That is so not my motto.
Hey.
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Yeah.
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
What are you doing out there?
I am, uh, I am...
Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.
No.
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
What's-what's the difference?
Hey, y'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
What did you do on yours?
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Says who? Your mom?
Yeah.
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
I spelled out boobies.
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
What?
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Huh!
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
You're not a senior?
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
And that's Phoebe over there!
Hi!
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
Not really.
Well there you have it!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
Yeah.
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
No.
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
I can hop.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Yeah.
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
What?!! What?
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Why not?!
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
Hi!
What-what are-what are these?
No-no-no, no!
I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Hey! I call her!
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
No-no
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
How did that happen?!!
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
How did you make $17.
How come those?
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
How drunk are you?
That's the perfect amount!
Okay!
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
I get that a lot.
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
But we're not ready to tell yet!
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
I'm coming already!!
Jeez!
Hello, Chip.
Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Don't say it.
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
I know that.
Hey!
Hello.
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
Huuh.
Well, didn't you?
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
No that made me feel precious.
Yeah? Sometimes it's...
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Okay!
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
About four hours.
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
Isn't that great?
Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
That's excellent.
So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
That's not possible!
Ow!
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
Hey
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
Uh, hello.
Hi.
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
Yes but my mom got me this job.
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week.
What are you doing with the lamp?
I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out.
Wow! Skates!
Well...
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
What?!
Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
Oh, well that's not so crazy.
I'm just easing you in.
I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
Yeah, okay.
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Who's Paul?
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
He finally asked you out?
Yes!
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
I'm not all right.
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Say that to him and you're golden.
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Why would they think they're invited?
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
Diane Keeton.
Do you realize you get louder each week?
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Sounds like a date to me.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
How did he do this?
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Hey, where you been?
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
I do not have baby fever!
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Uh-hmm.
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
Well, what did you do?
What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
You gave her food poisoning!?
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
God. I feel violated.
Ross, ten o'clock.
Is it? Feels like two.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Yeah, I-I don't care.
Okay. I-I can't watch.
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
What? We could do it!
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
And that's Pete's Mom.
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
Noooo!!!!
Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
Pheebs?
Huh?
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
So what's going on with you?
Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
What?!
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
Well you don't.
Yes I do!
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Really?
Well, it still has to go, right?
Why?
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Your mother told you this?
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Ohh! Really?!
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
But we don't know the neighbors.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Gooood morning!!
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
So how are you doing?
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Well, thanks, we like him.
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
Uh, good.
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
What?
Bunny!
Thank you.
Monica, I'm your best friend.
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Yeah!! I call that London style.
Oh.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
$4.50 please.
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
And could I get my ring back?
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
No-no, let me in!
Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
Yeah, that's true.
Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Ohh. Ouch.
What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Since when?
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Who was it?
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Sure!
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Ross, can I?
The head, the head. You gotta...
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Mmm.
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
Really?
Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
What?! Really?!
I can't believe this!
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Have you seen Chandler?
No. Why?
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Hey.
You're naked in this picture!
I know.
You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
No! Drums!
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Yay!!
Oh, in that case--Yay! That was me hopping on board.
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!

Hi Joey.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Hi, oh hi.
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Look, it was a job all right?
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Oh! Him.
Oh. Whew!
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
And you knew about this?!
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Really?
But again, Simmons. Go on.
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
I'm crying here!!
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Of course!
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
...and live forever as a machine!
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
She's sleeping.
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
You get the dollhouse.
I get the dollhouse!
It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
I, I, I'm hideous.
Come in.
Hey baby, I'm back...
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
So, this isn't over?
Really? Okay. Great!
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Sure.
Normally, I would not do it.
Well, what made you make the exception for me?
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Oh crap!
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
Oww!
What's the matter honey?
It starts?
Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
Whoo!
Cool.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
Yes.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
When did I say that?
Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Hey! What's up?!
So all we have is ice?
See if he has ice.
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Yeah, isn't he?
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Whaddyou want?
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
That's not even a game!
What? Shut up! We're winning!
Fine, let's do it.
Oh, I have cards!
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
Hi, Alan.
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
C'mon!
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
How come?
Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
To the Bings!
I'll do it.
Who wants it? Anybody?
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
Oh, an old glove?
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
I was just leaving.
Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, Big Brother.
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Glass, sand, whatever.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Oh, I can still do that.
How are you still single?!
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
What?!
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
No, it's really good.
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
What?
Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
I guess you can.
All right.
Okay. Can you give me a little push?
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
I'm with Hamilton!
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
I know, I can do this.
Ooh, and I can do this.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
How?
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
Yeah.
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
What?
Your nails.
Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Unless...
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Noooo.
Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Dr. Burke will see you know.
Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
Ready?
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Let them win one.
You're not even giving them a chance!
They have racquets don't they?!
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
Try the bottom one.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
Hey, look who's up.
I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
What's the other one?
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Oh, we have some...
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three.
Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02.
I can help with that.
Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
It's the basketball playoffs.
Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
She's right y'know.
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
I didn't think I was!
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
What 'cha doing Mon?
What are they?
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
So Santa's coming?
Yes! Santa's coming!
How do you know so much about this?
I don't know.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Monica, what are you doing?
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Would you please get some rest!
I'm fine.
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
But the mess!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Bobby.
Yeah, OK.
OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
So, what are you saying now?
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
Thank you! Break!
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
How come those?
What happened to uh, MEG.?
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Ben, dinner!
Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
Noooo.
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Bye!
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Sixty guests.
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
I don't know.
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
We ruined everything.
Ugh...
What do you, what do you mean?
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
Where can I wash up?
Thank you.
Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Pheebs, run!
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
That guy's still doing that?!
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.
Wow, is that Michelle?
Yep.
Ya know, she's having another baby.
I thought she just had one.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
Ya know, the man's got a point.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
No I don't.
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
Sure. Yep.
Certainly.
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
What are you guys talking about?
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
But I love swing music!
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
What are you gonna do?
Rachel said that!
Well Rachel's not here!
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Yeah.
I wanna hear "The Sound."
Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
No, there's no dog here?
Oh my god! Where are you?
I'll be right there!
I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
All right, be my guest.
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
I am so attracted to him right now.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Well, Joey's my best friend.
I'm not your best friend?
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
How have you never been on Oprah?
OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
Oh, wait a minute honey.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
We said six!
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Hi!
Oh my good God.
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Uh-hmm.
I love you so much.
Oh yeah, totally!
Oh good.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
How can they do this to me?
Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
G'night.
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
Oh God.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
It's perfect.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
You sound like a guy.
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Let's do it!
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
I was tired!
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
It's Richard Burke.
Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Doctor Burke is sexy?
Oh God, absolutely.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Right here!
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
Some moms do that.
Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Yeah, okay.
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
Well, they always called.
Hmm, bite me.
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Eh...
Okay well that's good to know.
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
That was you?
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
Hey, he's not crying.
Yes! There's still pie.
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Chandler!
Yeah.
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Okay, this one I like!
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Have at it.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Not uh, not to my recollection.
Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
Umm, your boxes are umm...
What?
Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
When did this happen?
Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
So, are you gonna see him again?
What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
What?
Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
That sounds great!
Hey!
There's gravy?
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
I'm all better now.
I helped!
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
No because it-it didn't seem important.
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
Well, uh, he's a doctor.
A real doctor?
Well that's wonderful. . . I
Mom, it's OK.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
Get out, get out of my apartment.
Least of all you.
Why? What you'd do?
Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it.
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Does anybody need anything?
That is so unfair.
I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
We all hate Emily!
Nooo!!
Yeah!
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
Pizza?!
Monica!
No.
Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
That, that's what's stupid.
Down at the docks again?
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
Oh, is he hungry already?
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Okay.
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Hah!
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
So we can be friends who sleep together.
Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
Oh.
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Okay.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Oh, great. This is just...
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
Why, exactly?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
So, this isn't over?
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Yes!! Ohh.
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Okay!
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Okay!
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Oh my God! What happened?
Sixty guests.
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Well, he's very charming.
Well, you're just gonna have to try.
Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
What?
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Monica, leave him alone!
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
I don't know.
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
You said number two.
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
How?
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
So, that's it?
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
You keep saying that.
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Okay!
Okay.
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Yeah, that makes sense.
Over my dead body!
Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
'Scuse me?
There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
What?
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
Maye it's me.
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Hey Rach.
Stop picturing it!!
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
If the school finds out you're fired.
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
What are you talking about?
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
No he's not!
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Ah.
Well maybe we just take that one away.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Okay.
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
What?!
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
Awesome!
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
There are seven?!
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
Hey Pete.
Hi, how ya doing?
Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Well, we should probably get going.
Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
I don't know, I don't have my jammies.
Well, maybe you don't need them.
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
Ohh!!
There it is.
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
What are you doing here?
Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
Still?!
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Oh.
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
You get your messages!
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
Yeah.
I never had a bike of my own.
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
What, look back?
Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Why is your family Ross?!
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Hi Pheebs!
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
Woah.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Well, thanks anyway.
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Will you stop!
Okay. All right.
Gin.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
Why?
You are an idiot. .
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
What?
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
And twenty-five it is.
You gave him cookies?
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
You are?
Yeah!
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
How we doing, you guys ready?
Some days it's all I can think about.
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Just mine?
I'm afraid so.
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
They kept your room for a while.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
What is the matter with you?!
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
What was that?
Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
Time is money my friend?
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
I didn't know it was a big secret.
You have a third nipple?
You bitch.
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
Not a basset, a bassinet.
You really need the bassinet?
Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.
Uh-huh.
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Okay, good.
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
That cup is mine!
No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
This totally makes sense!
It does not!
All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Absolutely! Absolutely!
White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Hello? Who are we spying on?
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
Oh!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
That can be arranged.
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Yes!
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Damnit Carl!
Oh my good God.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Sorry! Sorry.
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
It's my New Year's resolution!
What, to blind my child?
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
I know honey, I'm sorry.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
What?
I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Did you smoke?
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Richard!
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
So uhh, you ready?
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Yeah.
Hello!
Yes, and grumpy.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
What? That's impossible.
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
No, just give me another minute.
Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
Yeah.
See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Oh, Chantal!
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Yes, we should. I think we should.
Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
The what?
No, I think it's cute.
Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
Depends on what you mean by we.
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
What?
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
I have plans.
You're plans were with us.
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
But you're not.
God. I love you.
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Didn't it like totally speak to you?
Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
Men just take out wind?
Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
I am. Let me just get my coat.
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
Phoebe, tell her!
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What? Ow!
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Sorry, that was wax.
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Oh Willie's still alive!
What are you guys doing?
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Well this is just sad!
That is not a problem.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
I made fun of his accent.
No.
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Okay.
What the hell is that?
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
But, but?
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Right, and...
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
But you've only slept with two people.
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
No more jam?!
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
What are you talking about?
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
You're plans were with us.
That's right.
Okay.
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
They don't have those.
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Ohhh, yeah!
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
Ross, that is gorgeous!
Yeah?
Hey.
Hey. Hi Phoebe.
What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
Put all my money in me.
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?
Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
Tho?
Ohhh.
Ok.
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Well...
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
They're not listening too me?
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
I know I love you!
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
I'm marrying her.
We'll just see.
Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!
I hope it's you.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Ohhh!
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
I need to get some Richard.
Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
Maybe, because you told him not to.
What are you the memory woman?
You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
What if they get mixed up?
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
-leg?
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
Ooh, steer clear of you.
That's right.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
Oh.
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Joey, speed it up!
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
We know!
Okay.
Okay, everybody hold!
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
Aw.
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
What-what-what are you gonna do?
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
It could happen.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
I hate men! I hate men!
Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
I just thought he was nice, y'know?
Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
Oh, ok bye-bye.
Grazie.
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Well, get it off now!
I can't! It-it's stuck!
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Maybe nobody's tried this.
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
Okay.
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
Huh?
Check out the rack on this chick!
No, I'm not!
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Rachel?!
Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Hi, sure!
Hi.
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
No thanks, Josephine.
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
It's not?
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing.
And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
It's coming from Joey!
Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
Still?!
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Two.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
That's what you say about porn.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Okay great!
Yeah!
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
Getting it away from me would be job one.
Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
God, what is wrong with me.
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
No?
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Um-hmm.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Right.
You said no right?
Huh?
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Yeah.
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
What?
Could tonight be the Night?
So, did you shave your legs?
Yeah.
Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Hi!
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Ok, this could be tough.
Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
It's James Bond.
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Those two only had each other!
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Okay. Well there's one down.
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
I'm gonna start getting ready!
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Why do they keep doing that?
Right.
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
What's wrong Phoebe?
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Hey, Danny!
Hey! What's going on?
Salad.
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
...I can imagine.
I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Tell her what?
How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
He's so cute.
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Naked friends.
Hey.
Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
Y'miss it?
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
That's ridiculous!
Can I use.. either thumb?
All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
No.
Really?
Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Like what?
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Hey! I made that for her!
You made pottery?
No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
You had fantasies about Emily?
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
But we've only had one job.
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
Hello!
I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good.
Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Okay, I didn't hear that.
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Oh God, even his knock is boring.
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
Then I've gotta go. Bye.
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
I can't believe this!
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!
Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
Fine!
You found that handle, did ya?
That's not funny.
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
What are they?
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
I had to go with the odds Rach.
Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
I'm so glad you liked them!
Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Will you get us better gifts?
Fine!
That's what you got me?
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
Pretty much.
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
You could kick anyone's ass you want too.
Thanks you guys.
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
He is the man in the black dress.
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
I got it!
Okay.
Or. We could put a hat on his head.
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Oh.
Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'
Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Oh, I got that for him.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
What in God's name is that?!
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
Who are you saying "check" too?
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Hey!
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
Well thanks!
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
And where is your hat?
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
Sounds great.
Okay.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Well, you know Chandler.
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Can I get you some coffee?
Hi, sure!
Hi.
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
Well, people are different.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
No.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
I don't like your massages.
See? It's no big deal.
When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Joey, you had the night!
What?
You-you think?
Did you like learn about her family?
Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
Why?
Because they made me.
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Monica, what are you doing?
I guess it was kinda funny.
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
Yeah!
With what?
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
What do you, what do you mean?
Surprise...
Sur-surprise.
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
There's gravy?
What are you doing?
I think I left a donut up here.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
What are you talking about? What wedding?
Come on, like you never talk that.
Afraid to ask him?
Could not be more terrified.
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
God! What are you, in second grade?
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!
What?
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Yes, but there isn't always time!
Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
Yeah!
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Yeah!
Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
Well...
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
Regular or decaf?
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
I know I couldn't. So....
How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Woo-woo!
I can't believe you did that!
I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Phoebe, what are you doing?
You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire.
Hi.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
What are you smiling at?
I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Alright, what have we learned so far?
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Ohh, I love birds.
What is the matter with you ?!?
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
But we're not ready to tell yet!
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Hey! Hi!
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
Oh, she's gonna love that!
Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
It's for their own good.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
Very good.
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Really?
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Okay. I'll be right there.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
...Take off their hats!
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
Hey guys.
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Mmmm! It's good!
Really? How good?
Mmm.
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
Phoebe.
Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
You want me to see a therapist?
Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
And-Joey!
Do you want me to learn?!
Let's give it a shot.
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
How did you do that?
I don't know!
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Hey.
Hey.
Ehh.
Eh, you work for that.
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
You hated me when we were kids?
Why did you hate me?
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
All right. Bye.
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
I miss you already!!
I miss you too!!!!
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
Okay, come here!
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
Bye.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
Yes!
Would it matter?
Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Honey, there's a reason.
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
Have you seen Chandler?!
No! Why?
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
What?!
Does that mean Carcass is available?
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Well, sure, that too.
Can't hear you!
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Well, those were seals, man.
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one.
Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
I'm not freaking out.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
Guys guys, check this out.
Excellent.
Ohhh.
What?
Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
What?
Why?
Hey!
What a tool!
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
So that's two of my wives.
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Hey.
Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
Hot dog?
Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
What?
Monica, I'm cutting you off.
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Oh God!
Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
What?!
I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
Alright, we have to talk.
There it is!
Is there somebody else?
No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
All right. I think it was a mouse.
How are you honey?
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
What's this?
You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
Really?
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.
But you're not.
Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Hm-mmm.
Oh, yeah, good idea.
Hey man, what's up?
Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Ewwww!!
Ewwww!!
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Oh, fine! Take his side!
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
You're Lewis Posin.
Who?
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Isn't he good?
Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
I believe you know my husband.
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
I bet it was about her a little.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Oh my God.
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Yes.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
We both do that!
Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Would you excuse me for a second?
Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
Hi.
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
2 hours, 27 minutes.
Really?!
Hey Rach!
Hey.
OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!
Well, what's the job?
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
Is Tony Randall dead?
No.
Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Okay!
I can cook and you can take care of the money.
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
I, I don't have it.
Nobody does honey.
Hi.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Ohhh!
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
What are you doing?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Let's go!!
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
Megan!
Monica!
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
Which one was Pete Carney?
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Great!
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
What's Phase Two?
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
You owe me 20 bucks.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
All right, I'm nine years old.
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
I don't want things to change! Do you?
No!
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Hey!
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
Does it matter?!
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
Yes!
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Okay.
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
And also, my birthday.
It's not your birthday.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Well, yeah actually.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
We are! Help us!
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Oh, okay.
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
You mean there's more than one of us.
Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
Ok, then just go.
Ok.
Sure.
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Oh. Thanks.
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
What?
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
Yeah.
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
No! Never! Never! Bye.
No touch! No touch!
That's sweet.
No, it's more like a good luck.
Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Why?
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Really?! Really?!
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Hey, Sophie!
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
Oh, please.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
I sure did!
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
Hey!
Hey!
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Like an eclipse.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
Ew, this feels very weird.
You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Wow!
Do we have to?
No.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
Done.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
But if...
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
I am a good kisser.
Is that the heartbeat?
That's it.
So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
Oh, yeah. I know that.
I so wanna be attracted to you.
Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
Hey, Mon, you want some help?
If you want.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
You were invited?!
No.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
I can't believe she's married.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Oh, it's not the ideal way...
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
Okay.
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
What is the matter with you?!
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
What's hard to believe?
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Electrical plans for the building.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Wow! If only more people knew.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
Okay. Sorry.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Well, I never call me.
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
What? What? Why?!
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
That's right.
Chandler loves marriage!!
You got that from what I said?!
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Are you okay?
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
I bet he can.
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Jody!
You were with Julie?
Oh. Oh my God.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Ooh! Brian's Song!
The meeting with the guy went great?
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
What check thing?
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
That's Bill Clinton.
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
OK, stop.
Hey Rach.
Ahhhh.
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Yes!!! Oh!!
Hypothetically!
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Okay.
Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
You are so cute.
Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
What?
You've got panties stuck to your leg.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
Um-hmm.
What am I making him by the way?
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...
That's not funny.
Well that's not true.
Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
You do?
It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
No way. No way did you do this.
Monana was very brave.
So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Noo!!!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Yeah, get out!
One more game?
Oh yeah!
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
In a bad way?
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
Sorry.
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
What a wank!
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
All right.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Big time!
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
Oh, look, wish me luck!
What for?
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
But I...
It is? Really?
Yeah, sweetie.
No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
OK, tip the man.
Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.
Ooh, this is it, 74.
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
She's not Rachel.
Oh my god.
Oh my god good?
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
She lets you borrow them.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
What else?
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
What?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
I didn't know you could get married here.
May I help you?
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Floopy?
Yeah.
Oh, like that's a word.
Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
How do you mean?
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Sure.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
I want the little round waffles.
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Arghhhh!!!!!!
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
BEND OVER?!!!
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
You know where I work!
I do?
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
To get you to make out with him!!!
Ohhh.
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
Oh, it's gonna be fine.
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
For camp!
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Uh-huh.
Look I want you, now.
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
Joey, no means no!
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
Whoa.
Yes, and the dimmer switch.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
It's that terrible?
Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
I love you too.
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
No.
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
No.
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
But we can go, right?
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
Yay!
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Oh hey, here Pheebs.
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
All right. Okay. I'm starving!
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Come on.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Hey!
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Is it dry in here?
Let me, let me get you some wine!
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
I'm so glad you liked them!
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Well, you seem fine.
You mean like exclusive friends?
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
Okay, I'm hearing.
What?!
Or! A bakery delivery person.
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Whatcha doin'?
Ooh.
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
What?
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Umm, can we see you ride it?
Okay. See?
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
Oww!
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
How is that ever going to happen?!
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Well maybe we just take that one away.
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Ow!
Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
Monica! Hi honey.
All right, on the table.
Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
Promise me you'll be careful.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
Yeah.
All right. I think it was a mouse.
How are you honey?
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
What?!
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
Phoebe!
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
I'm gonna do it.
But I...
Please!
You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
Umm, I'm still here.
You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Two girls and a boy?
Yeah!
Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
Yeah.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Okay. I'll be right there.
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
We're the Bings.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
They kept your room for a while.
Come on, you know they love you.
As much as they love you?
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Really?
Sorry.
Who?
Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Well, I did not know that.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Nooo!
No-no-no-no, we're done.
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Hey!
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Why to save your dignity my man.
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
I said name one!
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
I'm just easing you in.
Oh, alright.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Sure.
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Another good point.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
Yes!
What thing?
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
I'm gonna do it.
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Yeah! You're the best!
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
Your sunglasses?!
Yes!
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Pete, can I get you something else?
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Sorry.
Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
Hello!
So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
Sure.
Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.
You really sure?
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
Ok.
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
I called him.
Nooo.
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
Alright, shall we?
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
Thank God.
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
What does it look like? I'm going home.
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Not any more.
Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
So how's it going with you guys?
So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
Ah!!
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
That, that's what's stupid.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Looking up?
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
Are you crazy?!
Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
No.
I mean don't you trust her?
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
Sure.
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
"You have two new messages."
Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
What did you get?
Credit.
Hi.
Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Oh.
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
Hi!
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
They had to have that specially made?!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
What?
Are you serious?
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
So you like it?
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Well, then can we meet him?
Nope. Schhorry.
Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Really?
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Water! Water! Water!
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
What?!
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
What Richard thing?
Simmons! Go with Simmons!
I'm not mad.
Really?!
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Have you found your dress yet?
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Okay!
I have.
This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Because we can remember them.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Alright, I'll call you.
I don't think you mean that.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Well, we certainly are alone.
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Right.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Hey!
Hey, how'd it go?
Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
No, don't say it.
...love you.
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
...And then he burst into flames.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Nah... not-not special enough.
'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
No, my first fan mail.
Alright!
Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Yeah-oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London...
Already?!
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
How-how did that happen?
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Monica...
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Really?
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
I thought you could use the help.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
This is the most special day of our lives.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Hey!
How did we do?
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
What?!
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Yeah baby! No baby!
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
He's fine!
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Chandler?
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Because the kids need new shoes.
This will just be my batch.
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Mon?
Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
No.
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Yeah, I heard it.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Y'know what? You are right?!
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Really?
Of course!
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
Hi, remember us?
Mmm hmmm.
You're that stupid.
I am. I'm that stupid.
You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
Hey, I went up.
What?
Do what?
Put all my money in me.
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
What?! We can't do that!
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
Ok, what the hell happened back there?
I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
What are you going to make?
Yummy noises.
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
We're switching rooms.
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
Hey!
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Ok, so let's talk money.
All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
What?
Oh honey, but it is just about...
It is! It is!
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
In the game room!
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
How's it going?
Ooh!
Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'
Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Joey, this is you!
A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...
Can't hear you!
No ma'am.
Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
What a baby.
Total wuss!
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
What do you got there?
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
Ok honey, you really need a job.
Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
Chicken Kiev?
Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
Woo-yay!!
Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Bye! See you later!
Fun Bobby is so great.
Half full of looooovvvvve.
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
You had no relationship!!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Come on, hurry!
Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Oh, good. Thanks.
Now what is Fabutec?
Waxine!!
Yes! Have you seen it?
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
You mean like exclusive friends?
Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Oh, you go out with him.
Oh, really?!
This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Gotcha.
Oh, you bet I am!
Okay, here's your penis!
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
I think that's fair.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Hi.
What?
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
So don't do it.
How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .
Blow drying what, you have no hair.
What's goin' on?
Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
Oh!
No.
Oh.
Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
Okay.
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
That was pretty 007.
Hey.
Yeah, they're not coming.
What?!
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
She is a kook.
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!
But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
You know!
Okay. Good one.
Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
Way to be strong, man!
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Yeah?
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
Doesn't matter.
What?
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
You want his yearbook?
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
It's really not that big!
Takin' that with you, huh?
Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Oh my god.
What?
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
All right, you!
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
Hi.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
Aww, I love you so...
What is wrong with you?!!!
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
Yeah, me too!
Oh, look at that.
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
You sound like a guy.
You'll have a last kiss.
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
This woman's living my life.
What?
You're not an artist.
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Okay.
Are you all right?
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Okay, fine.
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Well it didn't!
What?!
Okay, that we may be able to do.
How?
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
I love you too.
You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
I'd do anything for you.
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
Help!
Where have you been?
Oh, just had a baby.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
I was frustrated with you!
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
I think that's fair.
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
What was that?
Monica knows.
Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
I'm not arguing with that.
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
It's your joke.
Is not.
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
So this is Brooklyn.
Okay.
Got it.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Hey!
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
Great nap.
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Monica bang!
Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
You okay?
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
I'll see you after work sweetie.
Okay. Bye!
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
It's Hexadrin.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
Oh.
Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
I miss you already!!
I miss you too!!!!
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Sure!
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
No.
Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
You love her!
What-what is love really?
I am a good kisser.
Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
Yeah!
Okay.
Aww!
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Hey!
Hey! What's up?
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
Not any more!
Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Ugh!
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
Oh my God.
I know. I need more pie.
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
Wooo!! Hoo!!
Okay quick, help me get this off!
Yeah!!
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
Well, what am I going to say?
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
He took off?
Go on! Go on.
Chandler?
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
I don't know. A month?
I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Sometimes we were.
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
You're our age!
So ah, we on for tomorrow?
Yeah, kinda.
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Why?
Because!
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You don't even know me...
