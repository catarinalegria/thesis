Okay.
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Did I, uh, did I miss something?
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
Hey!
Not so much!
Whoah!
Hey!
Alright, now try taking a puff.
What?
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
What?
What... did you get me there?
Hey.
Ooh! That's so nice...
...Chandler!
And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
You were right.
No!
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
Come on.
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
Okay!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
No-no-no, the kiss was good.
No, but that's bad!
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
.
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
Well maybe I love ya'.
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah.
Oh, so that's what this is for.
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
Sure is.
OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.
No.
Yes.
Oh!
Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
Oh.
Yes!
Duh, where've you been?
Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Why?
I have my reasons.
Joey!
Joey?
Ma?
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Yeah!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
You're building a post office?
Hi!
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Hi.
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Really?
Oh God!
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
What?!
Thanks.
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Yes.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
And you feel like we hold you back.
Oh!
No.
Hi.
All right.
Go.
Hi.
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
Monica.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Chandler!
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Okay, fine, $300.
Wow!
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Doing it on this table.
Exellent dream score.
Why, why, why would you dream that?
Yeah?
All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Chandler!
Geez! Are you ready?
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Oh.
What?
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
Why?
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.
I can't sleep now.
I know.
No you know I don't mind.
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
I know.
I've found.
I do?
No, I am.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
Okay.
Oh!
Weekend at Bernie's.
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Everyday use.
Really?!
Hey.
We were just talking about you.
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
Right in there!
Ross!
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
Ross!!
How crazy that we'd run into you!
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
Monica!
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Oh no! No! No!
She's sleeping.
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
OK.
That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
Ready?
No, you've got to whip it.
Chandler.
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
Ross.
How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
Hey, you guys.
Thanks.
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Ross.
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and...
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
Thanks
Thank you.
Here you go.
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
What check thing?
I do.
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
I do.
Yeah you do!
Huh.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Right.
You okay?
Phoebe moved out.
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Whoa!
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
I'd call that excessive.
What?
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
Bye.
Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye.
Bye-bye.
So, we gettin' a fish?
You had sex with her didn't you?
Joey?
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
Ma?
Joey!
Joe?
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Wow thanks!
Yeah!
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
Ross?
You're naked in this picture!
I know.
Hey Chandler. Monica!
Ross, are you okay?
Fine!
I do NOT want this unit!!
Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Hello!
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Yeah.
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Yes, and grumpy.
Hello.
Oh, seriously you want him?
Hello.
And who is this little cutie pie?
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
Richard!
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Who?
What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Oh you knew that. Good!
Monica?
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
What?!
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Ok.
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
Yeah?
Pheebs?
Hi!
Haaaa... ... ahhhh!
Huh?
Skull?
Phoebe.
Yeah, oh wait!
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
Chandler.
Come on in.
Guys?
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
Over here.
Have a seat son. Hey!!
Joey...
That was like 5 years ago.
Yeah you got 5 years left!
You wanna make it 6?!
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Phoebe!
Give me it!
It's gone.
Hey!
Hi Monica.
Really.
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
I know. That's what I told her.
Yeah.
So- you can tell?
Sorry.
Oh, yeah.
Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
It's morphin time!
Stegosaurus!
Sure.
Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys.
Hi.
Uh-huh.
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
You, you want, you want me to move out?
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Uh-oh.
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Can I help you?
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
Yes!!
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
Absolutely!
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
Alright.
Sure is.
OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.
Good luck Phoebs.
OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'.
Bye!
Okay.
Okay, bye-bye!
Bye-bye!
Okay, I need a date!
Here.
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
The receipt.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
How?
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Again I must go back to, how?
Monica...
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Will you marry me?
Nice!
Is she gonna be all right?
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
That's great!
Excellent!
No-no
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Okay!
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
No?
That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
No.
No.
Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
Nothing!
I made a...
What is that?
So what are you gonna do?
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Right!
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
I think you're my favorite.
Which one do you have?
Sorry!
Gotcha!
That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Okay, okay, you got it!
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
All right, I'll see you guys.
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
Yep!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
We're gonna see each other naked.
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Count of three?
I'm good.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Joey we know you steal our food.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Bye-bye.
Whoa, I'm not done.
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
What, what, what?!
Freedom!
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Foot rubs for a month!
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
Goodnight.
Hey.
Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.
Look at that, they won't even turn their heads.
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.
Hey!!
Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
Hi!
What is he doing here?!
Janice?
...And what did you bring?
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Oh.... my.... God.
Hey, it's Janice.
No!!
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
Whoa!!!
Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.
No-no-no-no-no!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Come on! I really need your help!
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Okay.
Noo!
Sophie's desk.
Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Chandler!!
Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Nothing.
Hey!
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Nothing.
I am... free!
Ohh.
Ohh.
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Ohhh.
Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Oh, god.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Ow!
What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
Sure!
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Three!
Two!
Two!
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
I know!
So, what do you think?
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
I see.
Good luck!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Thank you.
Thanks.
You okay?
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
Help yourself.
Phoebe moved out.
Right.
I'm back.
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
I know.
So, are we gonna get together or what?
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
That's me.
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
I'm him.
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
Okay. Okay.
Thanks daddy.
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
'Kay!
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Can I ask you something?
Uhh, no.
Ah!
What?
Ross says hi.
This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Ahhh.
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Ooh, let's see it!
Okay.
Oh yeah, that looks good.
And?
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
So what does this mean?
Aww!
Okay.
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
Chelsea.
A woman's
What woman?!
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
Can I be that guy?
Congratulations.
Is it--?
Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
Cupping.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
What?
That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Ehh.
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Really?
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
Exactly.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
And now you want that money back.
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
It's not a real game! I made it up!
Fine.
Oh, right, that's me!
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Phoebe, what is it?
All right, you know Paolo?
God?
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
It was you, pal.
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Help!
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
We are! Help us!
All right! But, you do it with me once.
Joey!
Hey-hey!
Okay. Oh yes.
Hey!
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
I am now!
Hmm.
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Isn't this great?
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Joe...
We're never gonna find anybody.
Well then let me do it!
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
Joey look it's really sweet...
Marcel?
I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Marcel?
Marcel?
Me.
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Why would I have to sleep with you?
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Morning.
Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?
Eddie.
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
No-no-no-no!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Okay.
YES!!
Uh fellas,
Noo.
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Nooo.
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Oh. What do you do?
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
Ohh!
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Okay...
Uh-huh.
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
Give me $400!
Professor Geller?
Ooh.
Yes?
Whatcha doin'?
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
Please?
Come on, let me see that smile.
I don't wanna.
I wanted to go to the strip club!
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Seriously?
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
No.
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
So...
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
I hope she throws up on you.
Just us.
Oh, what a crappy night!
So?
What?!
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
Yeah?
Thanks!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!
Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
Oh!
Two.
All right, ready?
One.
Three.
That's kinda nice.
Wha-
Yes, you're having a boy!
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Wha-
What is it?
Who?
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
Marcia and Chester.
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Yes?
All right. Bye bye.
Bye bye.
Whatcha doin'?
Ooh.
You!
BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
What is that noise?
It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
What kind of changes?
Yuck!
Is that a swing?
Oh don't even ask!
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
That was like 5 years ago.
Oh God!
Okay.
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Really?
All right.
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
Go.
Hi.
Okay, good.
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Yeah.
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Okay, great.
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
I'm fine.
Oh, I don't know, a million?
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
All right.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
That's right.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
Instead of...?
Never had that dream.
No.
Oh great!
Oh, this one's for me!
Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
And the big one's for me!
Ooh, let's open them!
That's it?
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
Yeah, it was really hard.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
'Kay.
What-what 'cha doin'?
Checking to see if it's even.
Looks good.
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
....with??
Say it... say it!
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Funny story!
You're not going to believe this!
...Dinah?
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
You didn't.
...Hm.
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
I suppose mainly sexual.
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
...spender.
Hey, big...
Shhhh!
She's still asleep.
So how'd it go?
Aahhuuhhh....
Oh yeah? That's great!
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
Hey.
Hey!
Absolutely.
Welcome home man.
A little foos?
What happened to the foosball?
Ah that's a cantelope.
Again?
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
Ahh-hahaha!
Excuse me...
Good evening.
Ha!
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Ahhhh!
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Hey!
You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
Ahhhh.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
Excuse me.
Uh, is your name Chandler?
Uh, yes, yes it is.
Ahhhhh!
Okay.
Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
Already?!
Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
Okay!
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Alrighty.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Alright mister, let's see those panties.
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
What?
Arghhhhhh!!
Sorry! Sorry.
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
I'm over here big guy.
Awesome!
Why don't you just go out with her!
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Aww.
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
You wanna share it?
B-bye!
Bye.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
Before!!
Before the snap!
After!!
Now, does it really matter?
Yes!!
Buddy?
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
Where's Buddy?
My fish, Buddy.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
But...
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?
Call.
Check.
I'm in for fifty cents.
I'm in.
I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
Centerpieces!
Okay.
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Condoms?
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Congratulations!
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
Uh-huh.
Cookie?
Are you okay, sweetie?
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Carol moved her stuff out today.
Ohh.
Cups.
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Well, what's it called?
I don't know how to play Cups.
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
Daaahhhh!
What?
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
Done.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Great! Thanks, Rach!
Doug!!
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
Hmm.
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Du-ude!
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
Eeeshk.
Hey.
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
Yeah, big stuff.
OK, let's go.
Eh!
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
Hey!
Eh...
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Okay well that's good to know.
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
Eh?
So, uh, how was he?
Eh.
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Well, that makes me feel so good.
Fancy.
Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Everyday use.
Guest.
Fancy guest.
Flashdance.
What?
There was a seen in Footloose...
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
She was a welder.
G'night.
But I made cards!!
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!
Go.
That's a bird!
OK, OK, it's my turn.
Uh.... bean! Bean!
The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Good-good-good-good.
Is this?!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Gotcha!
Sick-sick-sick-sick.
Oh, I'll get it.
That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
Sorry!
Hello-dillillio!!
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
Chandler!
Oh, somebody's feeling better.
Stick out your tongue.
Hey!!!
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Heyyyy-What?
You-you're gonna get married?! I mean... We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
Hhhiiii.
I don't want a beer.
Who said it was for you?
What's the matter with you?
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Hi...dad.
I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
Hello all!
Hi Mr....Bing.
Nora!
Hike!
Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! You wanna go shotgun?
Yeah!
One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Over here!
Hm-hmm.
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
See?
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Horn-swoggle.
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Howdy.
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Janice?!
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
Oh.... my.... God.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Joey... Switzerland?
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Like?
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Long!
Nice shot.
I got it!!
I can't believe you let them win!
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
Lovely!
How long have we been home?
About a half an hour.
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
No.
Mar-haaaan.
Mar-klan.
Mar-gha.
Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down.
Uh, hello, it's third down.
Marcel?!
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Marcel?
Marcel?
Marcel?
NO!!!
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
Never!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
You never come into this office again!
Fine!
Ni-hi-ice!
I love it at Joey's!
Hey, here you go.
Thanks!
So, you busy Thursday?
Nine.
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
How many?
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
"Heating device."
No-no-Really?!
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
Of course!
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh...
Nope.
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Never done that before.
Hi!
Hi!
Of!
Hey!
Wheel!
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Off?!!
We're all right.
We were just waxing our legs.
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Oh!
This is from the woman at the bar.
Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.
What time is it?
Oh-oh-hey!
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
With a K.
Wow! You are really good at this.
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Oh-oh.
I see what you're doing!
Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Ohhh!
All right, I'll pick that one.
That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Ohhh!!
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
You should! How is she?
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
Hello! Who's in there?
Ohhhhh!
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Just go over and say hi.
Okay!!!!!
Me asking is kind of a sign.
YES!!!!!!!!
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Okay.
Oooo-ooh!
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Ooooh.
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
Ooooohh!
Well, what happened?
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
My God.
Are you sure?
Oop!
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
Oop, your cake is ready!
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
Pheebs!!
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Speech! Come on Monica!
Phil.
Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
Paul!
Phil!
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Prague?
Y'know, you're right. Thank you.
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
There's sooo much you don't know.
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Rach...
Yes, we are.
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Ready!
Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Ready?
Come on eight.
Yes, yes eight.
Really!
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
All right! You can have the chair.
Oh my, would you look at that!
"Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
Refill?
The nerve huh?
Yeah!
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Rent?
I don't know... um, Grease?
No....
Yes! Rent!
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Rhythm?
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
No, my first fan mail.
Alright!
Score.
Hey, where you been?
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
She is so hot!
Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
She?
Hey.
How's she doing?
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Shut-out!!
I'm having a son. Um...
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Skull?
Pheebs?
Huh?
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
Oh my god!!
Smooth.
But-but this block is like a whole other world.
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Excuse me?
Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
So?!
Hey!
Hey!
So?
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
Stripping!
Yeah?
And do you know what girls are really good at?
No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
Sure...
Jack used to handle the finances!
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
I don't know... um, Grease?
Surprise!!
Hello?
Surprise!!!
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Well, it was all Ross's idea.
That.
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Luck!
Together.
No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
All of us.
Not at the concert.
Ok.
Too?
Ohhh...
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
Do you mind telling us what it is?
Totally.
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Hey, did she buy it?
So did Heldi show you the place?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Two!
Count of three?
One!
Two!
Three!
Tyrannosaurus!
It's morphin time!
Stegosaurus!
Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!
Where are you going?
Uh-huh
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Why is everything different?
Bye!
Uh-huh!
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Uhhhaahh.
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
No, that means nothin to me.
Pecan sandy, just made em.
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Umm?
We're just gonna be friends.
Y'know what?
I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
I've got five bucks says you can't.
Unbelievable
"When can you move in?"
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Uuuh.
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
I wa-
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Volleyball.
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
Quick volleyball question.
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Waaa-aaah.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
What?
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Well?
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Look at this!
Wellll?
We could write it down for you?
No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
What do we do? What do we do?
Wh-wh-why?!
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Wh-what?
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
What???
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Oh my god.
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
Where?
Oh! Pathetic!
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Our place, the hall! I...
I got something for her. It's a book!
Whoa!!!
What was it?
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
No!!
Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
All right, I'll see you guys.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Woooo!!!
I'm gonna call after you!
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Y'think?
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
You could do that!
Yeah!
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
Yay!
Yeah!
Yay!
Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
Okay!
Ye-e-es!!
Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
Hey.
Hey.
Yeeeeahhhh.
Oh, well...
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Yeah. Yeah.
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Yes!!!
Yes!!
Would it really have been that easy?
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Hey! What's up?
You.
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
So what do you want?
You have me!
Nono, just you.
Yuh-huh.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Nuh-uh.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
What? What?
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Oh no.
What?
I'm having my first contraction!
Ooh, it's not bad.
Okay.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, lucky for you.
What?
Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
You did.
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
Who got married?!
What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
I like her.
Wow! This girl is good.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
You're right.
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
Yeah!
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
Yeah, okay.
Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
You okay, kiddo?
Alright.
Nice save.
Oh man!
Joey!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Unless...
That's great.
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
I'll go.
Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Fine.
Thank you.
I'm sorry!
Oh yeah!
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Rachel, wait, wait.
All right!
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
Oh God.
She said she'd call me.
Ohh!
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Oh yeah!
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
Hey, all right!
Oh yeah.
What if I turn out the lights?
Okay!
Chandler?
Yeah?
Oh, God.
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
You guys.
You got screwed.
Oh my God!
Oh, yeah.
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
No no, that's me.
Oh, hello.
Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
Hey, Janice.
Here we go.
Ok, have a good break-up.
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
That's great!
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
You serious?!
Really?!
Yeah well, we'll see.
Yeah, I know.
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Because you do.
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Hey!
Oh thanks.
Okay.
Here's your key
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
No, Janice.
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
Thank you.
No freakshow, she's fictional.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
I love you.
Hey!
Hello, Chandler.
Wh-what's going on?
Oh.
No. No!
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
Hello, Rachel.
Well, not at first.
Hey, man!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Damn!
Oh yes!
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
You serious?
Okay, get ready to owe me!
Okay.
Oh, good!
I'm still on London time, does that count?
That counts!
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
I Ross...
I KNOW!!!
Oh. Oh, God!
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
Open up! Open up! Open up!
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
I know!!
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
People can hear you.
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
I don't know.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?
Yes.
You think?
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Need a new table.
Hey hey, come on in!
Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
Oh yes.
Okay.
All right now, memorize it. You got it?
Is that your card?
Yes.
It's nice.
So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Yeah?
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Yes!
Yeah, alright.
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Alright. Phoebe?
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
That's OK.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
We can't do that.
Oh, hey!
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
That's nice.
yep, that's me, I am that stupid .
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Okay .
Yeah!
Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .
Here you go.
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
Yeah, baby!
No, I just I think that it's too soon.
No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
What are you doing?
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
What happened?
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
Why can't you tell her?
You did?
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
Don't go.
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
Okay.
Okay. Oh no, I have to.
Too bad, she's leaving.
Okay. Thanks.
Really?!
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Okay!
You wanna hug it out?
Thank God!
Do you have my credit card?
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Oh, I can't go.
It's true.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
No way!
Well that's pathetic!
Again true.
Oh hi!
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
Hey everyone!
Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
Oh yeah?
Hey.
I made you a surprise.
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Did you not understand the story?
Oh, ok.
What?
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
Is she gonna be all right?
Oh, yeah?
How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
I miss Rose.
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?
Hey, Pheebs!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Hey!
Mornin' Pheebs!
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
That's one?
There are seven?!
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
It's kind of an important one!
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
What? Why?
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
We're switching rooms again.
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Okay man.
Yes.
Thanks man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
You got it.
C'mon, Ross!
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
No, sir.
Nice to meet you Monica. Bing!
Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight.
I'm intrigued.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
I had one.
Hey.
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?
I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
Two it is. Ross, how about you?
Thank you!
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Chandler! You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being.
No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
I'll talk to them!
You bitch.
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
You have a third nipple?
Whip it out, whip it out.
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
You got me.
You-you do?
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Yeah. Right.
I love you!
It's an old key!
Oh my God it's old!
I love you!
Are you hugging the door right now.
Oh, hey.
Alright... I've got to go shower.
Hi.
Hi.
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
Oh, okay!
Oh my God!
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Morning!
Oh right.
They do?
Then, I don't get it.
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
I just wan't to...
Okay. Bye.
And there it is.
I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
Bye.
Bye.
Okay great.
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
Okay.
Dude-dude-dude!
What?!
Oh my God!
Oh, God.
You got screwed.
Oh my God!
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
Then what?
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
My first time with Carol was...
What?
Yes. Yes!
All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
What's this?
Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Oh, well...
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Yeeeeahhhh.
Well, I just...
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Excuse me?
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Really?
I so am.
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Okay, bye!
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Great. I'll see you later!
What the hell was that?!
What?
What is it?
Wha-
Wha-
I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Hey!
You done?
So what are you guys out doing today?
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
Yeah.
Oh, there's our stop.
You ready?
Hey!
Hi!
Yeah.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
You said...
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! .
We're baack!
You sure?
Sure you do.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
Uh-hmm.
I love you so much.
You win.
Yeah, I'm just mad!
Then keep running.
Well, what did you have?
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Hey, it's me.
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
Hello?
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
You know it?
You guys live around here too?
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
Look man!
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
I need juice! People need juice!!
People need juice!
Listen to me!!
What happened?!!
Are you all right?!
Yeah...
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Yeah, well...
Yeah baby!
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
We could get that Everest video though.
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
Hey Joe.
I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
Oh.

I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
That's ok.
Okay.
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
What's goin' on?
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
That's true!
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Yeah.
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
That's true!
Well, hello!
Yeah, I'll go get one.
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
Hey.
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah!
Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Why?
Let's go.
They've been quiet for a long time.
Maybe she killed him?
Is that your new walk?
No, I really have to pee.
Yes. Yes.
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
You?! And-and you?!
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
I think so.
Two hours, that lasted!
So did you break up with Joanna?
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
The volcano?
Excuse me?
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
What's up?
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
Oh all right.
Hey.
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
Yeah, coffeehouse.
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Oh, all right.
What are you doing?
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
Look I was going to tell you!
Is not.
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
It's your joke.
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Hi, oh hi.
Oh no-no-no!
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
We still have porn.
Hey.
Oh, yay...
Okay.
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Great...
Hi!
I want you out.
Yes please.
Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.
No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
Where did you hear it from before?
Why not?
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
What?!
It is?
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
That's fine.
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
No sir.
I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
There you go.
Hey!
What was that?
Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
Thanks man.
14?
No, 19.
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Maurice.
Yeah. Right.
You got me.
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Okay.
It's horrible.
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Excuse me?
Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Hey Pheebs!
Nope!
Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
Ohh! You made up!
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Yeah, all right.
I'm an assistant buyer!!
All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
Okay.
So, we're having fun, right?
Hey, Mon.
Hi.
Hey!
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Do I ever.
No, I am.
Okay.
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I do?
You want it?
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Why? I love that thing.
Oh no.
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Who's that?
Not bad.
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Pierce Brosnan?
No way!
Thank you. I'm from New York.
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
Hey Joe!
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Hey!
There you go.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Yep.
Had it.
Yeah, I've had it.
Had it.
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Oh! Yeah!
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
I am now!
Hey-hey!
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
Hey roomie!
Okay, bye!
You betcha!
Can I get a beer.
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Is it the Italian guy?
Um-mm, yeah right!
You think?!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
You're welcome.
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
I'm gonna try.
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
What?
Uh, Ross?
Okay. Okay.
Stop saying that. I hate that.
Are you still mad at us?
Yep.
Yeah, that's her.
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
Thank you.
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Yeah, all right.
Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
All right!!
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Yeah!!!
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
All right...
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
That's what it sounded like.
Hey!
Hey!
Good night.
Totally worth it!
That was one good minute!
Good night.
Men are such idiots.
He is?
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
Like what?
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
What-what-what is so funny?
I said, "Like what?"
I do like that.
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
I knew it!
What?!
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
Cool, girl roommate.
What a baby.
Thanks man.
I gotta go check something over here.
Total wuss!
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
Hey, kids.
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
Hey.
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Hey, sweetums.
Great.
Hi, honey.
Hello to the rest.
Hi!
Hey, yo.
Bye.
Tonight?
What's tonight?
It is our first official date. Our first date.
See ya.
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.
So how you two gettin' along?
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
Hi there.
Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
Hi.
That's that weird voice again.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Oh my God.
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
You mean this.
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
No, the quiet down thing!
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
Hi, Joe.
Hey.
Hey! Oh.
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
I know I am.
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
Who's doing shots?
Yeah.
Hey! You okay?
Okay.
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Ooh, something hurts!
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Not bad.
Okay, who wore those?
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Who's that?
Right here!
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Oh man!!
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
Oh no-no-no-no!
Why would he turn off the TV?
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
We don't know what could make this go away.
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Oh, aaaah!
He's got nothing!
Okay, I'm ready.
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
What are you supporting?
Oh, no-
Okay, it's in spasm.
Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going.
No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there.
What's going on?
My lighter's in there!
Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
F-hah.... flennin....
Oh.... my God.
That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
I mean, this is unbelievable.
Oh, ooh.
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?
Huh.
What?
Uh, hey!
Hi, guys!
Hi!
What's going on?
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
I, I know.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
I'm right here!
Y'know, all the women.
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
Why not?!
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
What is the thing?
You be cool.
Diverse.
Did anybody call for security?
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
By me?
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Oh, no!
No-no.
That's correct.
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Sure.
That's sweet.
No touch! No touch!
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
No, it's more like a good luck.
So uh, what did this woman look like?
Hey Phoebe!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Or an uncle...
Hi Pheebs!
Pheebs!
You-you do?
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
You got me.
Okay, absolutely!
I'll do it.
No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
All right.
You've got it.
Okay, one...two...
Come on!
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
So we are going on two?
All right!!
Look, Monica...
Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait!
Look!
This is not going to work.
You or me?
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
You guys are messin' with me, right?
What? Nothing.
Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
Yeah baby!
Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!
But, we pick again! We pick again!
Why?!
Oh, I don't know.
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
You mean with Casey.
Let's go!
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
You're so efficient. I love you!
No-no-no! We need something old!
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
Me too.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
Hey.
Hey.
There's the man.
I think they get it.
Ok.
He-he-eyy.
Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
Yeah, o-okay.
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
So...
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Uhh, no.
'Kay!
Can I ask you something?
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
No.
What is up?
Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
Hey man.
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
I love you too.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
Aw, it's soo unfair.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
Oh that's great!
Oh, it went amazingly well!
Great!
Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
Oh my God!
Ok, Phoebe.
You never know.
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
Such as?
Don't do it.
Oh!
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Well hello!
We'd love too.
Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
Where have you been?
The doctor.
Do I ever.
Hey, Mon.
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Chris says they're closing down the bar.
No way!
Hi, Pheebs!
Didn't think so.
Hey, Phoebe!
Hey, Pheebs!
Hey, Pheebs!
Not yet.
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Did you talk to him?
Then, no.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Why two?
Okay, on three. One....Two....
Why don't we just go on two.
Because it's faster.
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
No, I don't.
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
You love her.
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Hey, you guys!
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
I don't want to, I'm scared.
Hey!
So, what do you think?
The doctor.
Well hello!
Where have you been?
Is everything okay?
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
The sheep.
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
What?
Hey, what you do on your own time...
Where's my underwear?!
What's wrong?
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
Hey!
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
You don't have it.
No!
D'oh!! I've got it!
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
No I didn't!
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Yes, you did!
No I didn't!
You're kidding.
Oh, somebody will.
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Uh, Julie.
Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.
Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks.
Yeah?
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
Sounds great.
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
Okay.
Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Come in!
You mean like, music?
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
You look good.
I'm gonna put on some music.
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
You don't know?
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
What? You'll hi-ya?
I can't do that.
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
There he is!
I sure did.
Hang on buddy!
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Why?
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
What picture?
I do not hate Ross!
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Okay. All right.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Will you stop!
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Gin.
All finished!
I have no idea.
Done with the bookcase!
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Yeah, I guess.
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Hey guys.
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
Yeah, I understand.
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Not a one.
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
No plans, huh?
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Oh, right, right, shut up.
Hey, it's Janice.
Janice?
Oh.... my.... God.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
I could die.
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
That was you!
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
It's 6:00.
All right.
This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
Yeah, well...
Hi!
There you go!
That had to hurt!
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
You're definitely scaring here.
Would you like to call somebody?
Bob here.
What?
I got a little drunk...and naked.
What've you been up to?
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Hey, Lowell.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Hey, Chandler.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Hey, big...
No! There is.. there is noone else!
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Shhhh!
...spender.
Hey, gorgeous.
That's probably what they'll say.
I'd like that.
Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Hi Monica.
Huh.
Look at her.
He-he-he, how's it goin'?
Hey nice boobs.
Your pants!
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
So, rocks.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Hey, all right!
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Hey guys!
Hey!
Oh, the Olympics.
To Monica!
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
You look great!
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
Hey!
Oh, thanks.
You okay over there?
Ohh, yeah.
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
Yeah.
Sorry man.
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
What? Oh!
Here's your scone.
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
That's laughter.
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Love is the best medicine.
Why do you do it?
I don't know.
Are you Joey?
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Are you Chandler?
Huh. This is nice.
What?
Taste it.
I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
She is now.
Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
Oh good!
What are you saying?
I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
I got glasses!
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
Well, you-you've always had glasses.
No I didn't!
Hello, Janice.
You'll never get me, Joe!!!
No, thank you. Chandler!
What are you doing here?
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
That's the stuff!
Yes, I realise that.
Summer catalogue!
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
That was Joey!
No!
But she just came up here!
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Yeah, get out!
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
One more game?
Ok, that's me.
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Dennis.
Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Umm, yeah.
Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
'Scuse me.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
Marry me.
We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!
I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
No-no-no-no. Hey!
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Hey sweetie.
No reason.
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
Yeah, why?
Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?
Tribbiani.
Our baby.
I love you. And I know about the baby.
What baby?
We have a baby?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
I'm sorry man.
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
No, that means nothin to me.
Don't worry.
Ah, we'll all go. Come on.
Thanks you guys! Thank you.
God, I hope they kick his ass!
Honey, I'm sorry.
So, that's it?
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Hi, it's me.
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
Oh, my, god.
Janice? You called Janice?
What just happened?
What's with you?
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.
That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
Oh my God!!
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-
What do you think?
Yes, I am!
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Hey Rach.
Hi! Bye!
What, like a number?
Hey!
Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final.
Well, it's about time.
OK, stop.
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
Hey Rach.
I didn't know that.
Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
I never knew that either.
I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
The abridgment.
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
The what?
Oh, okay. The what?
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
Aww, man!
Yeah that's better than my way.
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Oh look! A letter from my mom.
So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Yes, Bunny?
What?
Peach pit.
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
-Peaches?
Yes, it is.
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
But it's available now! Isn't it?
Hey, let's go look at it!
Okay, let's go.
You are beautiful.
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Hi guys.
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Oh, I can't go.
Thank God!
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Uh, uh.
No, no, no.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Well?
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
What about him?
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Hi there!
Hey guys!
Hi!
Hi!!
Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
Joey! Joey!!
Why can't you tell her?
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
Yeah?
I thought your time ran out.
Oh-ho, yeah!
Hey.
You're a pathetic loser, right?
Sit!
Hi.
Say again?
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
He does?
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Feelings, such strong feelings.
I've found.
I know.
I know.
I've found....
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
Does for me.
Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
And lucky means, more cleavage?
Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
No, I'm not!
Check out the rack on this chick!
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Hello? Hello?
Where are you going?
I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
So how's Mindy?
Not really.
It's a sock bunny.
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Yes please.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Do you want a date Saturday?
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
He's a he?
Thank you Rachel.
Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Good luck Chandler.
Bye sweetie.
Bye hon.
Here I am.
Yeah, I knew.
Where's Chandler?
Wash your hands!!!
How did you...know?
Yeah! You?
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Are you still awake?
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Call me!
I did, but...
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?
It's my joke.
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
It's my joke.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Yeah, I remember.
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
I'll take that.
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
You want his yearbook?
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
I made a...
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
What is that?
Nothing!
What was tonight?
Okay.
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
You don't want to know what tonight was.
Okay. What was tonight?
What? What? What?
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
A pen.
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
What did you get her?
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
A woman's
Here in Chelsea.
Who's party is it?
What woman?!
Chelsea.
Me too!
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
I don't want things to change! Do you?
No!
What?! Ow!
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...
Beep!
Double it!
Not 700 exactly?
Yeah.
What?
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Go on.
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
And Milton Berle has a...
I'm not mad.
Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Really?!
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
It's up to you.
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
Oh, hi! How are you doing?
I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
I'm sorry too.
Could I be more sorry.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
I am sorry, Chandler.
Are you serious?
Just give us our apartment back!
Boy! I didn't see that coming!
Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
That's not funny.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
That's not funny at all!
Hey!
About what?
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
No! Ahhh!!!
I also said, "Yes!"
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
I don't believe this!
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
No! Shhh!
Huh.
Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
What you got over there? Tacos?
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
No, you should.
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
Now, don't argue with me...
Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
Oh the humanity.
Well okay!
A lot of other gas smells...
Meth-methane smells...
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
Well, what is it?
What?
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
What?!
Here we go.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Eww, I don't wanna do that.
Ok, have a good break-up.
Hey, Janice.
They do me?
I can't belive it.
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
I don't sound like that.
What is the thing?
Why not?!
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
What?
So what happened?
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Uh, yes.
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
Oh sweet Moses.
I know about Monica.
That's right! I'm not!
Then where the hell have you been?!
You know?!
What?
How little?!
Hello, Joanna......'s office.
I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
I can't believe it.
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it.
Anything larger back there?
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
Oh my god!
What?
Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Hey it's Joey!
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
Hey dude, it's me.
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
What?
He's open!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Pass it! Pass it!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
Yeah, you wish.
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
"You wish."
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Not once!
No, we only went out once.
You dated her!
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
Is it--?
Janice, you're--
Yes, I am.
Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
Congratulations.
I couldn't do it.
Hey.
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
You couldn't do it?!
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
Or Casey.
You mean with Casey.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
No-no, Kathy.
Could be Casey.
Good luck.
Here, I got five, I got five.
Thank you.
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Full house.
That is true.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Hello Rachel.
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
Get off.
Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
I will have one.
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
Neither will I.
Well, there you go.
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Hey Gar!
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
Hey Chandler.
Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah! Okay.
Hey Rach!
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
Oh!... Right!
How'd it go?
Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Santa? Really?
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Yes, is that okay?
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Yeah me too.
Hey.
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
I know. Yeah.
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
That's a hernia.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
That's a plane!
Okay! Okay!
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Totally.
So did Heldi show you the place?
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
I know.
Yeah. O-okay.
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
How about receiving?
No! No! No!
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
They're in my bag over there.
Get off!
Yeah. I really do.
Thanks, Chandler.
Hi.
Hi...May I help you?
What's it about?
So ah, whatcha watching?
Baywatch.
Lifeguards.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
Excuse me...
Mustached bastard...
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Good evening.
Ahh-hahaha!
Yeah, me either.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Maybe I could do it.
Hi!
Who was it?
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Uh, HELLO!!
You okay man?
Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Hi.
All right, I guess we should go.
No you can't.
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
She answered.
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
How many beeps?
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
There I am!
Yeah, for you!
Hey! There you are!
Are you okay?
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
Are you funny?
Uh, no not really. Why?
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Excuse me?
What are you guys doing?
See you later.
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Hi, honey.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
You remember Janice.
It was Max's stuff.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!
Vividly.
Hi.
That is amazing.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
Congratulations.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
There you are.
And?
And six others.
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Wow!
So was I.
Okay.
I was kidding.
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
But it's Ross.
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
Yeah, whoosh!
It's Ross.
All right.
Stop what?!
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
No!! You can't!!
There it is.
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
Ohh!!
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
There we go!
Okay, let's go.
Okay!
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Let's go quicker.
I was not flirting.
What?
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
You do? Why?
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
What?! Why did you do that?
A pharmacist.
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
No, I got him.
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
No, seriously.
Oh, seriously you want him?
Am not!
You're welcome.
Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
Who is that?!
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Hi guys!
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
Hey!
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
I'm not macho.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
I have no idea.
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
Which goes where?
Done with the bookcase!
All finished!
I have no name.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
So, you're just Bing?
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
Okay. Oh yes.
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
Hey!
Hey-hey!
Nice try.
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Wait, wait, wait!
Look, Monica...
No we didn't!
Hi!
You ate meat! You had sex!
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
I don't think so.
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
That'll work!
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Here just...take this.
Is it on?
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Hey!
What are you doing?
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Okay.
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
You pick one.
What about the birds?
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
I may have.
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Woo-hoo, stuud!
What's she look like?
What did you do?
Um-hmm, yeah.
See ya.
What 'cha doing?
Having a swim.
Okay, it's um...
Well, it still has to go, right?
Why?
Don't do it!
Don't do what?
Where's Monica?
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
Why not?
Stop that now!
All right, we'll start with...apples.
We'll be starting with apples.
Yes!
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
What a geek!
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
Oh, hi.
What a wank!
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
That was amazing.
That was amazing!
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
No, you're the best.
Come on in.
Phoebe.
Chandler.
I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
Sure.
Oh. Oh, God!
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
I KNOW!!!
Yeah we do!
Do you guys want these?
Yeah!
Ohh, well you got 'em.
All right!
No, no, no.
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Uh, uh.
About Ross!
What are we gonna do?
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
Oh! Oh!
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
So do I.
Me? No. You?
No, I want this to happen.
I'm gonna put on some music.
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
Fine with me.
Well then maybe you should take it.
Well then maybe I will.
Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
Who's drink can I freshen?
Yes, he is!
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
No he's not!
What?!
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
It's a four.
Here it is! Here it is!
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
I think so too.
Oh well, lost again. That's it! You and me, outside!
I'm marrying her.
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
We'll just see.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Here, here!
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
And a crappy New Year.
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Without me?!
Hey, what have you guys been up too?
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
Yeah.
Oh that is over!
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
He shot a bird!
That's terrible! I'm sorry!
Phoebe, are you okay?
Okay! Okay! Okay!
And the big one's for me!
Ooh, let's open them!
Hee hee!
Wait, we can't do this.
You've got it.
Okay, absolutely!
All right.
Cookie, now you can punch him!
What?!
He's a he?
Yes please.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Well, can I just...
Ooh, let me talk to him!
Oh-oh, my God!
Shh!! Wait, what?
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
I have my reasons.
Yes!
Why?
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
Here goes.
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
C'mon! C'mon!
...Yes?
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
Yes. Vividly.
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
She was kidding about that right?
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
I am pretending.
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Well then, do it better!
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
I can't believe this.
Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
You're a dork.
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
That's a pig.
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
No, look.
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Hey!
Sure you do.
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
You sure?
You're right, I know.
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday.
Okay.
I talked to Janice.
All right.
Hey uh, what's a matter?
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
Ummmmmmmm, no.
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Uh, the book?
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
What do you mean?
Monica's pregnant.
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
What? You'll hi-ya?
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Monica's wasted.
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
There you go!!
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
We use it!!
Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
Are you all right?
Okay.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
What do we got here?
Oh, okay, thanks.
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
You don't need to fill these silences.
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Okay, one question.
Okay, the old hug and roll.
Yep.
Shoot.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Give me it!
Hey!
Hi Monica.
It's gone.
Phoebe!
Again true.
It's true.
Well that's pathetic!
And this goes for all guys?
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
At this?!
How do you know?!
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Just go get some! Go!
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Bye, Pheebs!
Okay!
Ooh, uh...
Okay, bye!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Nothing, nothing.
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
What?
Rachel said everything was okay.
What, what are they talking about?
Sorry Phoebe.
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
I'm so sorry.
What am I gonna do?
Well is she...
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
I've never slept with someone for a part.
Sorry.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
I'm getting dressed.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Why?
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
...He's in.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
Good luck!
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
I see.
That is lucky.
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
You're a genius!
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
Now, there's two reasons.
Forget about her.
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Course there, they just call it food.
Well there you go.
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
You really like it?
Dude!
I have never known love like this.
Dude! How-how did you write this?
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
Well, I have some.
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
How? I don't have any money.
How much?
Well, close to...
Oh, that's Ross's.
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Who's this from?
Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Remembered what?
Do you wanna?
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
Really?!
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!
Hey.
Look at this!
Well?
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Oh! You have a window!
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Hello children!
Sorry.
Ahhhhhhhhhh...
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Okay.
Hello, children!
Oh yeah!
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
Hey!
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Of course!
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
You still want to move in together right?
Ross didn't scare you?
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Ooh, yum!
Actually, I don't like martinis.
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Hey.
Hey.
Where's Mary-Angela?
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
She's right in there.
Hey, Chandler!
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
How good is that?
See?
Hm-hmm.
Ohh yes.
So uh, which one is mine?
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one.
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Do we dare?
So, let's go.
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
I just saw Janice.
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
Honey, what's the matter?
Oh.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Ross is Batman!
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
Really?!
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
This is ridiculous.
Why not?
Because you sent away the dog!
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
What do you mean?
Uh, the book?
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
Whose is it?
All right! I found one that fits!
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Whose is it?
No, no, no!
Can we start over?
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
No, yeah, Ive done that.
What is with him?
Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
We never get smacked.
Okay, I'll do it!
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
Could I play?
Dude that is so sad.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
I just did them.
I kissed Kathy.
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
What?
Are you serious?
That was amazing!
Okay!
I forgot my paper.
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
That was amazing.
You wanna play?
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
It was the ring!
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Maybe it was the guy.
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
No! He blew us off!
Crazy bitch.
Man's got a point.
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Joey... we always know what you mean.
Out loud?
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
I was laughing.
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
So how are you doing?
Pirates again?
Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
Raymond Chandler.
So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Someone you didn't make up!
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
I can't help it!
How you doin'?
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Borrow money from me?
There he is!
Oh! Oh! The usher must be right! What, with all that training they go through! Get out!! Here! Hey man, you want the aisle?
No, I'm good.
There's our star!
So, so, what'd ya think?
Okay, I'll stop.
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
You're driving me crazy with that!
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Yeah, I know but...
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
Hey!
Actually, me too.
We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
I'm kinda beat.
Are you serious?!
Yeah.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Oh yeah man. Joey.
Hey. Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go.
I forgot my purse.
Oh.
Fun's over!
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
I guess I'm done.
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Uh-huh!
Morning, Ross.
All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!
I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
I'm getting married, to..day!!
Yeah you are!!
Nice save.
Yeah, okay.
Alright.
Mrs. Bing.
Mr. Geller.
Nice shooting!
You're shooting with Althea?!
Althea is correct.
We'll take Literature!!
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment. What name appears on the address label?
Our minister...
You did it! You got ordained?!
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Tell me what?
Just...please tell him.
Shut up!
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
I did, but...
Oh, no I don't.
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
Call me!
For camp!
Hmm.
She's leaving for three months.
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
Picking Rachel.
Yeah!
Do you know what's a bad idea?
That's right. Did you hear something?
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
Seven times!
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
In a foreign, romantic country...
Uhh, 9.
Hi!
Monica? What time is it?
But it's dark out.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.
No!!
Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
Well what is it? Is it a mole?
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Fine with me!
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
I don't know exactly.
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
When?
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Yeah. I really do.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
You really think so?
Thanks, Chandler.
Get off!
Hey! What's up?
Did you not understand the story?
Hey!
Ross!
Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
Because I'm cooler.
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Oh, how'd that happen?
No, seriously.
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
Right in there!
Really?!
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Hey!
Wow, you look...
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
But my clothes are-ohh!
No time for that!
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Okay. Good one.
What?
You know!
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
Great! Okay, here.
Okay, that's enough honey!
I don't know. Let me see the ring.
All right.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Okay, here we go.
Ross, I really don't think...
Lift!! And slide!
All right everyone, lift! And slide!!
Hey Joey, can I...
Dude! Dude!
What are you doing tonight?
Huh? Uh...
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Next time?
I love Vegas!
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Ooh, so close.
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Ohh, so?
Why?
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Who's Rick?
'We' would be me and Rick.
Who's Rick?
My husband.
Ooooohhh.
We're the Bings.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
Yeah you are!!
Morning, Ross.
I'm getting married, to..day!!
Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Do you think he knew I was here?
Bad London!
In a foreign, romantic country...
I blame London.
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Bad dream?
I'm not Jewish, so...
So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
I wasn't sleeping.
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
Me too!!
What happened?
Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
Me too.
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
Well, you're gonna.
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
No they didn't!
Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
Hey!
I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
Oh, that's mature.
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Oh yeah, come here.
Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Uh-huh.
All right, buddy!
All right.
All right!
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Oh come on!!
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
Okay, seriously, what do you think?
You look like a freak.
I'm sorry, who?
Hey.
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
But we don't know the neighbors.
Yes he did.
Joey Tribbiani.
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study. Uh, sir?
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Oh, no I don't.
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
I did, but...
I think that's gum.
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
I think they get it.
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
No problem. Hey Chandler
Ok.
There's the man.
Well, not at first.
No. No!
Hello, Rachel.
What is she doing here?
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Oh uh, when?
What?
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Big bullies!!
No! No!
Oh, come on!
Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!
Oh, hey!
Big dog?
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh...
Hey!
Hey!
Defend yourself.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
I'm a man.
Hmm.
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Say 200?
How about we play for more money, say 150?
150 dollars.
200 dollars.
You're doing it again.
Two fours.
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
What?
Okay.
8!:
You'll get one.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Oh yeah? When?
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
It came up.
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
So I nodded off a little.
Nono, just you.
You.
You have me!
Whaddyou mean?
Lose the other guys.
I'm not a dropper!
He's a dropper!
Oh yeah, that's right!
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
It's throwing and catching!
I know! I know!
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Well, it's getting late.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
So will I.
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
That dies with me.
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
Happy plane-aversary.
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
Aww! I love you!
Can I give you a present now?
Janice, you're--
Geez, look how fat she got.
Hey, it's everybody.
Yes, I am.
Is it--?
It's your timer.
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
That was a half an hour?
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
All right, then massage me up right nice!
Uh, what was that?
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
Yeah, I'm not in that.
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
Oh, here's a great one.
I know, but look at me all tan.
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
No thank you.
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
What's going on?
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
He's retiling my floor.
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
You mean scared.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
No, I mean happy.
Scared? Happy?
I can't sleep now.
Why?
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.
You want me to sing?
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
She was kidding.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Dude, I don't know.
Yeah.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
What check thing?
Thanks
Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
Really? Okay, so...
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
I think you're better than you think you are.
Know when to stop.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
All right, ready?
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
I think you're right.
One.
Two.
I don't want to say.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
Well, what is the other reason?
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
I'm goin' home.
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
What?
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
Joey... Switzerland?
How about Joey... Pepponi?
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Really stupid.
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Yeah. No. No...
So take care.
The food there was, was great.
Wasn't it?
You too.
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
No, you're the best.
That was amazing.
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
No, you're the best.
No, you're the best.
Well, I like danger.
Yeah.
Well, it's kinda dangerous.
Okay, you guys free tonight?
Yeah!!
Listen to me!!
Look man!
People need juice!
Juice, I need...
She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
We can't do this.
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
Come, come here.
No! Oyster?
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
You think I should?
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
I really do, yeah.
Okay.
You had to ask.
Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
Yeah.
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
Excuse me. Hi.
Wow! What a pleasure.
Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.
Yes?
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Monica said wedding.
What's the matter? You okay?
Yeah, it's just y'know...
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Oh yeah, totally!
I love you so much.
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Oh good.
Hello, Zelda.
Oh that's not true.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
London is stupid! Stupid!
Thank you, Joey.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
No-no, thank you.
All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
Then it's okay!
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
No.
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
No! Why does he have to go?
I didn't realize that.
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?
Yeah.
GET OUT NOW!!
...And boogie!
Get down!
Get down?
Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
...betrothed couple.
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Betrothed...
Hey!
Hey!
8. 8!
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Pick a number! That is your only job!
Thank you!
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Any contact?
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
She lent me an egg once.
You're in!
Atlantic City!
No thank you for... Thank you.
Okay, let's go!
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
BEND OVER?!!!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
Central Perk?
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
What's my last name?
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt.
Consider Casey.
Could be Casey.
No. No, Kathy.
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
Yes it is. See.
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Horn-swoggle.
F-hah.... flennin....
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
Oh.... my God.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
Then...who did?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
Uh-huh.
Too dry.
Okay!
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
No!
Very informative!
There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
Excellent!
Not at all inappropriate!
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Do we dare?
Ohh yes.
Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
We dare.
Aaahhhh. AAAAHHHHHH.
Well, I'm there too!
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
That's-that's not Phase Three.
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Why her mom?
Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
Well, how bout just her mom?
Cause I already invited her.
Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
What? What? Why?!
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
There are seven?!
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
Let me see that. Oh, yeah.
That's one?
Here in Chelsea.
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Where is this party?
Who's party is it?
A woman's
Yeah, I'm sorry man.
Hi.
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
I think it's necessary.
Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
Wooo!! Hoo!!
I think it's winning.
An egg?
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
I think it's insane.
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
And say nothing?
What are you gonna do Pheebs?
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Uh-huh, yeah that's right.
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
I don't want to look.
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Could you not look?
Hello?
Hey, were the hell have you been?!
Thank you, Ross.
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
All right.
Oh my good God.
But, you're not identical twins.
Damnit Carl!
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
And we're changing.
OK, let's do it. What?
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
C'mon give me five more. Five more.
No.
I KNEW IT!!!!
Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Gin.
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
My-Oh my God!
What?!
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
I know! They suck!!
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
You know the hotels?
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
In 1981 you were 13!
You said no right?
Right.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Huh?
You said no right?!
What? That's terrible!
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
No-no, we do it every year!
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
Okay, you are new!
Is there a puppy here?
You don't like puppies?
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
You don't like ice cream?
I'm off the list.
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Bye bye.
Okay.
All right. Bye bye.
Yes?
Whatcha doin'?
Damn Rollos!
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
Hey, you're back!
Hey.
Easy Lenny.
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
Oh, well no problem there.
So? I mean have you thought about it?
Okay. Here's the thing.
Easy tiger.
Man, didn't she like just get here?
Yeah!! Yeah!
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
So what are you going to do?
Ohh. Mmm.
Cage closed?
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Hi.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Still broken?
"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
No. Not anymore.
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Are you being British?!
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
I have some moves.
Okay!
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Yeah, let's just forget it.
Do you know why?
Well Monica just told me that they don't.
Yeah, they don't like you.
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
And then Tineals.
That almost hit me in the face.
All right, we have to pick captains.
Okay, so how do we decide that?
Well, why don't we just bunny up.
Did she call?
Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
What the heck is that?
No, sorry.
All right, maybe I should call her.
You mean the spitter?
Water it is.
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
Thank you, sir.
Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
What Richard thing?
What-what Richard thing?
Oh no.
Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Well, somebody should.
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Look uh, if we're gonna do this...
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
I'm still right here!
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
What?!
You're okay there?
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
I love it, when we share.
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
You understood that?
??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
Consider it done.
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Could be Casey.
Or Casey.
No-no, Kathy.
No. No, Kathy.
Consider Casey.
You can tell us.
Fine. All right, fine.
Yeah.
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
Ok, you can have it.
No.
Give it to me.
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
That was there when I got here.
I'm not moving out.
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Why, are you moving out?
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Yeah, I think it is!
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
Oh, okay.
So what did you do today?
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
Oh-I don't know.
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Men are here.
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
We make fire. Cook meat.
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Oh, yeah... yeah.
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .
Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
I'll be in in a minute.
You must stop!
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Shut up!
That only took me an hour.
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
He's got nothing!
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Hey, opposite, is opposite!
Okay, I'm ready.
Oh, aaaah!
What is going on?
Oh, I'm sorry.
There it is.
We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
But you found me!
Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Kill me. Kill me now.
What did you just do?
Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
I licked my arm, what?
It's breast milk.
Really? Okay. Great!
So, this isn't over?
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
We're in a relationship?
Let it go!!
No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
Hey!
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
...I'm, I'm okay.
What are you doing here?
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
Well, it is overdue.
What am I doing?
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
Yeah, it is the best.
That doesn't seem fair.
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
It's a great idea.
Yes.
Okay!
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
Is that a problem?
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
Well there you have it!
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Not really.
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
What are you supporting?
Oh, aaaah!
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
Duh!! Christmas!
Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
What are you talking...
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
No it is not!
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
What are you writing?
Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
But I just wa...
I just wan't to...
No, but you can't.
Uh uh.
Aren't you gonna...
You're in my seat.
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
What?
How is this your seat?
'Cause I was sitting there.
Not so much!
What?
Relax your hand!
Whoah!
Hey!
"Big guy?"
Nope.
No? What happened, big guy?
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
I got fired.
...I dunno.
Yeah, there you go!
Second date!
You don't know?!
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
American Express?
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so...
Bye, momi-moo.
Bye Dan!
Uh, bye Monica.
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
What is that?
Coffee house?
Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
You bet.
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
Condoms, dude!
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
What do you got there?
How come the writing is in Spanish?
Don't read my condoms!
Fancy guest.
Fancy.
Guest.
Two seconds...
Uhh, 11!
Good-bye muscles!!
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Or... Dick.
Oh.
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Hey.
Hey.
That-that's bad?
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Theyre twins!
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
Im sayin I see a difference.
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
Hey Duck, is Chick here?
So you ah, ready for our last practice?
Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.
Does it matter?!
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
When we were?
How young is young Ethan? Young?
He's... our age.
Okay, he's a senior in college.
College?
Okay, one more time.
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Perfect decibel.
That's what you got me?
Fine!
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
You made pottery?
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Hey! I made that for her!
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
It's a beautiful thing.
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
What's this?
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
It's happened to you?
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
Yeah! Once.
Well, what'd you do?
Can you hear that?
I am 26.
There you go.
Yeah?
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Where is Emily?
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
Man, didn't she like just get here?
What gay thing?
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
Okay, hating this.
Yeah, like in a cab...
Save it.
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
Aw, don't do that
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
Ok, thanks.
Hi, Just Janice.
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Hello, funny Valentine.
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
If you don't do it, I will.
Well, we don't want that.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
No that could kill her.
No so we're protecting her.
But we should take it.
Really?! You do that?
...and then it got canceled.
Well, I could cut it.
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
I'm coming already!!
I just feel so, uhh.....
All right!!
Jeez!
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
And there's daddy!
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
Hello darlings.
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
You're kidding right?
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
A four and a nine.
No. Why?
Well that's a full cup!
Yeah you can do it.
It might be kinda cool.
So I can do it?
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Yeah.
How do you do that?
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Wait here. Breathe.
It's like a gift.
We should always always break up together.
I didn't think I was!
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
Having a swim.
What did you do?
What 'cha doing?
What about the chick?
Chicks don't swim.
Okay. It's a chicken.
Hey!
I got you something! Open it! Open it!
It's cute, huh?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Hey, is Rachel here?
I think we've seen enough!
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
No.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Are you all right?!
OH MY GOD!!!
WHAT?!!
Yeah...
What happened?!!
What's your point?
Why?
Why?
PBS telethon.
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
You mean with Casey.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Or Casey.
No he didn't.
Thank you!
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
Did you hear that?
Wait!
You'd better run!
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
What about the birds?
That's patio furniture!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
You pick one.
What's in the bag?
Hey guys.
Hey.
Um, just some presents.
C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
Okay. What was tonight?
What was tonight?
You don't want to know what tonight was.
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
I'm not seeing Monica.
Hey.
Have you seen Monica?
What?
What?
Almost over man.
Yay!
Hey! Is the show still on?
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Why am I looking?
I hate this thing!
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Oh, hi Danny.
Games and stuff.
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
Oh-no, he's right.
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
You think?
Hi.
Hi!
Where have you been?
Help!
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Oh, just had a baby.
Mazel tov!
How did you...know?
Here I am.
Wash your hands!!!
Hey! What's she doing back here?
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
I love you so much.
You sure?
Uh-hmm.
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Oh yeah, totally!
Do we have to?
Wow!
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
No.
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
I am sorry, Ross.
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
I am sorry, Chandler.
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
This took you all day?!
How is that worse?!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
What?!! That's even worse!!
I don't know! But it's the same!
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
Sure I would!
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
I can't belive it.
What are you talking about?
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
They do me?
Is that a swing?
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Oh don't even ask!
Yuck!
And then he did.
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
Well, that went well.
It is okay, if I stay and watch?
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
I think so.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Ok, that's Eric.
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
Glad to be of help. Matches.
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
We said seven!
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
We said six!
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
"Benefits lapsed."
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
"Smoke away."
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
What?
4:00 A.M.
It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
So, can I get some candy?
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
Art lover!
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
What'd you say?
I said art lover.
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
I can't believe we live here!
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
People can hear you.
Dangerous Liaisons.
Big fat goalie.
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Weekend at Bernie's.
Diet soda.
Yes!
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Orange juice.
Emotional Knapsack?
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Yeah.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
FREE PORN!!!
You wanna see if we still have it?
Yeah.
Yeah!!
We have free porn here!!!
Funniest? Heckles?
He's even kind of cute.
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
That's what it says.
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
Knock, knock.
When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
Did you make brownies today?
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
Maureen Rosilla.
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
Mazel tov!
Where have you been?
Oh, just had a baby.
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
Much sense?!
From a bullet!
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
Mustached bastard...
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Excuse me...
Orange juice.
Diet soda.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Ha-ha!
Perfect decibel.
Okay, one more time.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
I know!!!
Hey!
Peter Parker.
Spiderman?
Hardy Boy.
Thank you.
What about you honey, who would be on your list?
Pierce Brosnan?
Who's that?
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Uh-huh.
Are you serious?
Probably because...
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
Really, bitchin'!
Oh my God! Play!
Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
Wow, it was so-wow!
Really?! I mean, really?!!
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
My wife's a lesbian.
Cool!!
Hi.
I can't believe you came back.
Scared? Happy?
You mean scared.
No, I mean happy.
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
Toootal chick-flick.
So good!
Suck-fest.
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
Whoa ho.
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
YEAH!!! YES!!!
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Oh my God.
I call Monica's room!
You can't just call Monica's room.
Well, what'd you do?
It's happened to you?
Yeah! Once.
I did it anyway.
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
Heads it is.
All right, call it in the air.
Heads.
Yes! Whew!
We have to assign heads to something.
You're our age!
I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
Okay.
So ah, we on for tomorrow?
Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
What are we gonna do?
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Yeah!
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
About Ross!
Oh, well, that's great!
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys...
Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Yeah! Yeah!
I can't believe you're getting married!
But we don't do that.
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Well, not anymore.
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
How drunk are you?
From a bullet!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Much sense?!
What does she do?
You're twins?
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
She's a waitress.
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
I know, I can do this.
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
Ooh, and I can do this.
We can't do that.
Well ah, ........y'know.
Okay, that hurt us.
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Both of us?
I hope he did!
That was pretty intense huh?
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too.
Oh, hello Rachel.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
How did you get in here?
Nope, not this time.
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Come on, quite yankin' me.
I'm not yanking you.
Come on, Rach.
A kiss? What are you talking about?
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
No, ten o'clock.
Ross, ten o'clock.
Is it? Feels like two.
What?
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
What'd you rent?
Die Hard still great!
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Die Hard 2.
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
How are you feeling?
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
I really wish that you wouldn't.
Yes, we were just...
A part of him did yes.
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
I'm already here.
Oh, you're-you're going?
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
Of course.
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
Hey, where you been?
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Score.
How do you know?!
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
At this?!
What we want honey.
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Hey, I know I what I want!
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Okay, okay, you got it!
Sorry!
Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Ah, there we go.
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
I think we proved our point.
You burn your mouth?
No-no-no-no, we're done.
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Nooo!
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
Oh, will you give me the thing.
Ohhh. Don't go.
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
I'm sorry.
No, I-I-I gotta go.
No. No! No! No!
Yeah, we are so sorry.
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
You're kinda stepping on the song.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Oh, hey guys!
Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!
Hey! Look who I found!
Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway...
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
Bodington's!
Thank you, buddy.
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
You could do that!
I don't sound like that.
They do me?
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Oh, oh Chandler...
Oh... Yeah, you do.
Yeah. No. No...
Really stupid.
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Well, close to...
Well, I have some.
How much?
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
The nerve huh?
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
Yeah!
Refill?
...Quality, right, great.
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
I'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Chandler!
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
What-why?
I'll talk to them!
Thank you!
No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
That's sweet, Joey.
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
That's very nice.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Man, this is...
Yeah?
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
What are you doing here?
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
Hi. Hi.
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
...I'm, I'm okay.
Oh that's too bad.
What happened to Janine?
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.
It was my racquet.
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
I was frustrated.
I was frustrated with you!
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
You knew about this?
What?
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
We're in a relationship?
Really? Okay. Great!
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
I'm afraid so.
Okay.
I broke up with her.
Hey.
So how was Joan?
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Come on, they were not that huge.
I'm not yanking you.
Nope, not this time.
Come on, quite yankin' me.
This is Janice.
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Yes! Well that-yes.
What are you guys doing here?
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Why else would we be here?
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Umm, this is nice.
Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
I know, it is isn't it?
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Great!! That's great!
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
She was a welder.
Flashdance.
Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl...
What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
Come on, tell me.
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
Me?! Why me?
So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Where ya going?
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet.
Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
So how are you doing?
Out loud?
Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Well believe it baby!
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
Well I-I-I'm not moving.
What?!
Okay. It's a racecar.
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
It's Monica's bed. What?
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Well, yeah actually.
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
So what'd you do?
How'd the callback go?
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
Good for you.
What? What can't you do?
Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
We can't do that.
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Uh, we might be leaving now.
We don't, really.
I'm gonna get coffee.
Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
I don't like your massages.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
See? It's no big deal.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
Sure, why not?
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
I am?
Oh my god! Youre amazing!
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
That's totally understandable.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
Don't worry about it.
So we can go out again?
Aww, thanks man.
What's this?
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Sure. What's up?
Hello.
Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
I think you smell great!
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
Absolutely!
Isn't this amazing?
Guess who we ran into today?!
Janice?!
How have you been?
Oh well, I'm divorced.
What are you guys doing?
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Oh Willie's still alive!
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
You see what I mean.
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
I used to have that bumper sticker.
Stopped for a Chunky.
Let it go, Ross.
And I'm cute too.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
That's okay.
And you're cute too.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Yes that was mine.
Hey!
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Hi! How are you?
Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?
Yeah!
Hello, Joanna......'s office.
I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
What is going on here?
Hiya.
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
We'll watch him.
Jacket now.
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
I don't think tho.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
You got your passport?
Oh! Got 'em right here, check!
It's all London, baby! Here we go.
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
Ohh!!
You mean they like you.
Stop making candy!
But they like it!
Maybe.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Oh, you get used to it.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Shall I carve?
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
It's nice that he has someone.
By all means.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
So.... I quit.
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
That's great!
Why?
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Let's go quicker.
There we go!
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Yeah!
Oh my God!
'Cause it's gross.
We can't accept this.
Why not?
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Really?!
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
Will you marry me?
Monica...
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Oh-no. No. No.
What a bad idea!
Jeez, what a baby.
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Yes, I realise that.
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
Summer catalogue!
That's the stuff!
How do ya do.
Hey.
And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
What's...
Umm, well, he's...
That's right! I'm not!
Ross!
Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
Then where the hell have you been?!
I know about Monica.
Check out the ring.
I know.
Where's all the tissues?!
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Hi.
They don't have those.
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...
It's not all juice!
Yes, you did.
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Hey! Happy birthday.
Hey.
Hey!
Thank you!
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
Well, I guess that's something.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
Okay.
Wish me luck.
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Good luck!
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Well, I did not know that.
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Ross, don't. Ross!
Okay, fine, fine. You don't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
We're kidding!
You don't want to believe me, I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny...
Whoa!!
Whoa, she's pretty.
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
I'm sorry, what?
Oh, what's the matter?
Hi.
Hey!
Well, you know that psychic I see?
Yeah?
Do I look fat?
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
Hey.
Noo.
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
No. No! No! No!
Ohhh. Don't go.
No, I-I-I gotta go.
Honey, honey, people are looking.
I don't care! I don't care!!
What is it doing here?
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Yes, yes eight.
Ready!
Come on eight.
Eight! Easy eight.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
Hey, mister tux!
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Hey!
Why aren't you guys dressed?
We have a half hour.
Monica and I are engaged.
Yeah I'll take that.
What's up?
Oh my God. Congratulations.
Thanks.
Are we in London?
Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
Oh, that is better.
What are you doing here? You can't be here!
I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.
We still have porn.
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Oh no-no-no!
Hey.
Hi!
I do not hate Ross!
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
What picture?
Alright, let's do this.
Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
Alright.
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Okay, that hurt us.
Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
Well ah, ........y'know.
Oh, so you're divorced?
My husband.
Ooooohhh.
No.
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
Oh my... God?
Oh my God!
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
So, what're you gonna do?
Could I borrow it?
We're not actors.
Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face and her chest I could really put something together.
Hi! Remember me?
Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap.
Screw the Knicks!
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
It's the Knicks!
Whoa!
I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Why am I looking?
Almost over man.
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Who's he huggin'?
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
That's Bill Clinton.
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
You said no right?!
You said no right?
Huh?
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Chicks don't swim.
Having a swim.
What about the chick?
Are you sure?
I don't know. Should we try it?
No I-I-I'm fine.
Yeah.
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Okay, fine, $300.
Monica.
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
300 dollars?!
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
So, what do you think?
I guess you don't.
Paolo made a pass at me.
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
I know!
Y'know what would work?
Thank you.
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Hmm?
Stop making candy!
Can I be that guy?
Chelsea.
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Okay, shoot.
No! You're the sweetest!
You are just the sweetest.
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
Okay ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.
It's a great class.
Can I get a beer.
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Got me.
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
You betcha!
Ross, ten o'clock.
God. I feel violated.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Is it? Feels like two.
No, ten o'clock.
Yeah, you're right about that.
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
No, it's too soon for you guys.
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
It's Clint! Clint!
See you later, Gene.
Bye, Gene.
What's up with Gene?
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Oh sweet Moses.
So what happened?
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh?
That's still in there?!
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Is this a service you're providing me?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Umm...
Wait up!
Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
Why?! What happened?!
Who are you talking too?
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
I'm so sorry.
So how'd it go?
...spender.
She's still asleep.
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
What are you talking about?
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
I can't belive it.
One more game?
Yeah, get out!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
Oh yeah!
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
We are bad people.
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
Hey, ready for dinner?
Oh, they're a hoot.
Chandler.
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
And who is your friend?
I'm-I'm Monica.
The one that doesn't.
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
Hi, how are ya?
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Why should I help you?!
What a sweet story.
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Here just...take this.
I don't think so.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
That's stealing!
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
It's a buffet man.
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
What's wrong with you?
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
What?!
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Bye! Thank God
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Dude, what'd you have?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Because we hate them.
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Why not?
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
We have heard you play.
That's what you should say.
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
What?
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
Hey, that was really good!
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Thanks! Let's keep going.
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
What time is it now?
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Uh, 10:30.
4:30.
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
The hot chicks?
...Come on! Why are we here?!
Okay, okay take a guess.
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Count of three?
Yep!
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
One!
Two!
Monica's a little drunk.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Hey, what's going on?
Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Awwwww...
No!! You can't!!
Stop what?!
I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
Look, they must be stopped!
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
So how's Mindy?
Hello? Hello?
Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
Brrrrrrr!
Relax your hand!
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
What?
Not so much!
Whoah!
So what are you gonna do?
The actress!
Thanks Rach.
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
Okay, keep saying it!
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Am I too late?!
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
No problem roomie.
I know.
Thank you.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure!
You okay over there?
You look great!
Oh, thanks.
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
That was so lame.
Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
This is not a sign!
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
It's an old key!
Then don't leave me!
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
What?
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
We actually missed it.
Why else would we be here?
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
This is insane!
I-I think we have too.
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
Okay. Bye.
Bye. Are you still out there?
No, there were two.
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
Including me?
Oh yeah.
I bet he can.
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
That's me! Come on!
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Okay to come in?
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Try telling my wife that.
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
All yours babe.
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
What?
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
You want some help.
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
No help required Chico.
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
Okay, hold on. Okay.
Pizza!
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?
Oh yes! Oh yes!
Oh yes!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
What, what, what?!
Bye-bye.
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
You really think that is what he meant?
You're kidding, no!
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
You're kidding!
Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So...
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
You wanna share it?
Aww.
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
Okay!!
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
Oh my God! Play!
All right! Bring it on, you...
Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...
Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.
Really, bitchin'!
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
I Gotcha!!
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
I will have one.
Neither will I.
No, no, it's just my tooth.
No, I'm alright, thanks.
Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold.
Do you want a refill?
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
Yeah, like in a cab...
What is that?
For the ride.
Save it.
Okay, hating this.
Hey! How'd it go?
Me too.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
You did the right thing.
You have done enough!
Yeah!
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
Oh, my, god!
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Helloo!!
Geez, look how fat she got.
Hey, it's everybody.
Like an eclipse.
What do we do? What do we do?
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Did you see Betty?
Surprise!
oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
Hang on buddy!
You guys. You suck too.
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
I sure did.
Oh, the mixed tape.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
You are just the sweetest.
How drunk are you?
But we don't do that.
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
That's the perfect amount!
Bored and bored!
Hey!
Oh, so, how are we doing?
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?
Noo!!
Y'know what, pretty good.
Uh, yeah.
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Yeah?
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
I can't believe you did this.
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
I know-
Chandler-
Me neither, y'know what-
Then, I don't get it.
What?
You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
They do?
That's what Monica said.
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
What?! Tonight?!
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Robert's coming out.
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
Know what I mean?
I was afraid of that.
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Yeah, I'll go get one.
Wow! Look at them run.
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
Well, hello!
Oopsey, missed it!
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
I got it!
Nice shot.
Mon, get out here!
Yeah!
Hey Mon.
Monica!
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
So I got ya something.
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
No, we're alright.
Plastic spoons. Great.
Lick away my man.
What are you doing tonight?
What do you got there?
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
Huh? Uh...
Dude! Dude!
Oh yeah? That's great!
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
Aahhuuhhh....
I thought it was $98.50.
Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
Well, I'm off to Carol's.

Thank you.
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
Are you hugging the door right now.
No.
Hey!
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Not fun anymore?
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
Please! I made this game what it is.
I'm still hungry!
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
Yeah, I'll sit down.
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
It's good to see you
You're table's ready sir.
Why can't you tell her?
What happened?
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-
Joey! Joey!!
We're worried about you.
I don't feel like talkin.
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
And some of us really have to pee.
Sorry Joey
There's a Mr. Bing!
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
Ohh!
But we should take it.
Well, we don't want that.
No so we're protecting her.
But we should move quick.
Why?
You don't like that show?
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
Y-, y-, you like that show?
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Plus, you look cool.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
Well, I just called Joshua...
Oh, how did it go?
Fine, let's do it.
What? Shut up! We're winning!
You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
Oh, I have cards!
Oh.
'S'why I'm dancing...
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Don't you have to pee?
Mindy.
Hey, you.
All right I'll have one.
Neither will I.
No, no, it's just my tooth.
So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
Yep, pretty much.
Oh my God!!
So you two are really serious?!
You-you're gonna get married?! I mean... We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
Totally worth it!
Let us keep the apartment and...
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
That was one good minute!
Good night.
Oh, this is not that bad.
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
You can totally, totally live on this.
Hey, he's not crying.
They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
Yes! There's still pie.
I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Okay, anything for you sir?
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Iced tea.
Did I not just tell him?
Yes, you did.
Oh fresh air!
Okay.
Okay.
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
First of the month.
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Right! And when is that due?
And that's every month?
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Hey, man. What's up?
Hey!
Hey.
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
No, Amish boy.
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
Can't we just use a pen?
Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
What, like a number?
Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Hey!
Hi! Bye!
Welcome home man.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
A little foos?
Absolutely.
Stop it. Stop it!
Let's see what else he'll do!
How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
Hi, this is Richard.
H-He's in China!
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.
The country.
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
So, this isn't over?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Really? Okay. Great!
Its Phoebe! Hi!
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
How do you figure that?
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
It still doesn't work.
The key's stuck in the lock.
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
I'm not finished.
Oh.
That's-that's my nubbin.
Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
What's that?
What's a nubbin?
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
So, what are you gonna do?
Ohhhh!
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
Me?! Why me?
I'm free! I'm free!
Where's Chandler?
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
That oughta do it.
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
In the game room!
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Oh, good job Joe.
So we are going on two?
All right!!
Wow, it's big!
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
He will, Joe.
Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
I'm so worried about him, y'know?
Honestly? Me too.
What?
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
Really?
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Okay. I'll be right there.
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
What does it say?!
What time?
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
Could I be more sorry.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Why is that so funny?
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
Yeah right.
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
We can't accept this.
This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
Why not?
'Cause it's gross.
That's... That's was...
Oh, Chandler.
Hi Chandler!
Oh my God!
That's Fergie baby!!
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Where's Mary-Angela?
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Well, what did the police say?
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
...The second guy.
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Which one?
Well, call me if you change your mind.
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Well, we are great guys.
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
I think it's great you guys are doing this.
You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
He has a gun!
All right, I can't wait!
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
No thanks, Josephine.
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Ohh, hi, Kim.
No thanks, Mom!
Interesting.
Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
What-what Richard thing?
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
Oh no.
What Richard thing?
Well it's very unsettling.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Then why are you smoking?
....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
Okay, that's enough honey!
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
I don't know. Let me see the ring.
Great! Okay, here.
Is that a real thing?
Hey!
Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
I just wan't to...
They do?
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
No, but you can't.
But I just wa...
I made that joke up.
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
What?
Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
We can talk about that.
Ok.
I hear ya.
Well, then...Let's.
I, I just never think of money as an issue.
What about the time difference?
The country.
No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
From here to the airport?
Yes! You're never gonna make it!
Um, is it sugarless?
Huh.
Would you like some gum?
Sorry, it's not.
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
You okay there man?
Me too! Me too! Me too!
Just stop it! Come on!
Yeah, I got too excited!
All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
A face ass?
Yeah!
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
A chin dimple!
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
Nice work my friend.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.
Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Alright, here's ten.
: What do you need, what do you need?
Fifteen.
Here, I got five, I got five.
Thank you.
Couldn't be more out.
Oh, I am very in.
Chandler?
Me too. Rachel.
Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?
No you know I don't mind.
Love....
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
I know.
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
Yeah, no, me neither.
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
I wanna quit the gym.
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
You wanna quit?
You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
I wanna quit the gym.
Stop making candy!
Y'know what would work?
Hmm?
But they like it!
You mean they like you.
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Y'know what...
No.
No.
May I help you?
Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
Is anyone else starting to really like him?
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Are you okay?
What-what are you doing?
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Oh, what's at 8:00?
I'll see you at 8:00.
Okay.
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
See? Here we go.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
Yay!
Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!
Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
What gave me away?
Hey!
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
Okay, I gotta go to work.
I'll do it!
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Yes. Right where?
I am so jealous.
You guys are really right...there aren't you?
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
That's the perfect amount!
How drunk are you?
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Okay!
Y'know what's weird?
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Chandler?
No!
You gotta do it, man.
The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
No.
Well this is just sad!
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
That is not a problem.
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
Oh, I love that guy!
What am I doing?
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Aww, I love you so...
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
What is wrong with you?!!!
What?!
Rachel lost Marcel.
Hi.
Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
Oh no, how?
He- he pooped in my shoe.
Oh, okay. Here you go.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Hey, where's the chicken?
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Another hard 8.
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Have you seen Joey?
No, that is what the game is.
Which you just gave up really quickly.
What's the matter?
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
I can't believe she's married.
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
Well at least we know she's a woman.
Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh .
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
It's a sock bunny.
Yeah!
Okay.
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Not really.
Okay, then get the lobster!
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
I know!!
Hey!
Hi.
Yeah! You wanna come?
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
Yeah!
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
You know, you think I would.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Do you have a point?
What's up with the simian?
It's just a fur ball.
And twenty-five it is.
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
You gave him cookies?
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
I'm not Jewish, so...
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
What?
So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
Bad dream?
And you're okay with that?
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
Your cappucino sir.
Why the voice.
Hard to say.
Thank you.
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
I'm over here big guy.
Arghhhhhh!!
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
You did look like an idiot.
I spelled out boobies.
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
You didn't just break up.
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
Hey, it's been like three weeks!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
All right, bye-bye now!
You got it!
All right!
Bye!
Bye you guys!
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
All right. Very good.
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
No.
Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
Ohh, get these things out of me!
Hi, Paul, is it?
Morning, Paul.
Hello, Paul.
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Stop!
Thank you! Thank you!
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
Oh, look! Look! Look!
Surprise!!
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
I mean, I was sitting there.
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
What do you mean, your seat?
But, you got up!
But, I never left the room!
She's not gonna say no.
I'm not gonna mess it up.
If she says no, can I have the ring?
If!
Hey!
Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!
What's wah-pah?
That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
That's what I did. Wah-pah!
Coffee in a fight!
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
I thought you could use the help.
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Sure! Why?
Hey, this is so unfair!
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
It's worse than the thumb!
Oh, why is it unfair?
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Hi! How'd it go?
Oh yeah?
Hey.
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
So, you busy Thursday?
Ni-hi-ice!
Thanks!
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
For three years?
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
This is not going to work.
Look, Monica...
Look!
I bet this will work!
You are so great! I love you!
Hi Joey's sisters!
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
Hey!
Hey. What are we drinkin' over here.
Well this one's for you.
Hey.
How come you have two?
Get out.
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Yeah, check out the ring.
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Oh my God!!
So you two are really serious?!
Well yeah, but then...
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
Depends on what you mean by we.
So it did go well.
Yeah, did I fool ya?
Totally!
Oh, it went amazingly well!
Great!
I think I should get the chair!
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
How do you figure?
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
You mind if I...
Hi.
Hi.
No, please.
So uh, what are you in for?
That's a low one!
Okay.
Okay. Four.
Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't.
What make you think I can?!
Ahh, third base.
Monica, what are you talking about?
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
What equity investments?
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
Yeah, let's just forget it.
I have some moves.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
What if I turn out the lights?
Okay!
And to you too, Helen.
But were fine.
Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch.
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Oh, okay. Send her in.
It happened in London.
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
How?! When?!
IN LONDON!!!
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Oh, what the hell is that?
I am, I'm ignoring you.
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
You mean like, music?
Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Come in!
That was pretty 007.
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
When I got married you slept with my sister.
Hey.
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
Look, are you gonna be ok?
I do.
That's who.
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
That's not Ross!
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Hey, you're not Kip!
Why would I be mad?
Okay.
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Hey, I've been honing!
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
What was with the dishes?
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
I'm not arguing with that.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
When'd you meet her?
Really? Right across the street?
Yeah!
Two days ago.
Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
Ah that's a cantelope.
Absolutely.
What happened to the foosball?
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
He paid a lot of money for it.
I'm the ruptured spleen.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
What?!
Why would you do that?
Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
We have heard you play.
Because we hate them.
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
We're the Bings.
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
What is that?
And a date with a man!
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Oh, I think I have the cash.
I've got five bucks says you can't.
Get out your checkbook, mister.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
Um-mm, yeah right!
You betcha!
Is it the Italian guy?
He's so cute.
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
And your friend Phoebe?
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
See ya.
So how you two gettin' along?
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
There's another carton right over there.
All right, let me in.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
That's right baby.
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
What?
That's patio furniture!
Yeah, well...
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
What about the birds?
Oh yeah man. Joey.
Okay.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Hey. Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Forget it, that's off.
Yeah.
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Why?!
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Me? No. You?
Sure.
So, here we are. Nervous?
No, I want this to happen.
So do I.
Rachel, wait, wait.
I'm sorry!
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Can I just say one thing?
Uhh, no-no thanks.
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
Unfortunately that is correct.
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque?
Viva Las Gaygas!
Yes!!
All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. The Lightning Round!
In a bad way?
She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
Your sister Ursula.
The woman who cuts my hair!
Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
Oh, really.
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Ohh, that's a good one.
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?
Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
They have the best stuff in there.
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Oh, do you not want to?
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Really?
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
No reason, except...she...told...me.
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Well, I'm going to kill you.
Uh, if you say so sir.
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Why?
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
You're meeting Richard?
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
You hear that? We're the guys.
Hi, oh hi.
Is not.
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
She's one of us now.
No, inside good, outside bad.
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.
Hi you guys.
Hey.
See you later Mon.
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
What does it look like? I'm going home.
Because that would be crazy?
Oh great, food with hair on it.
No, not the used wax.
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
Do you know what just happened?
Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
What?! What are you doing?!
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
So, what're you gonna do?
Oh my... God?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Joey's a sex addict.
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Thank you!
What?!! No I'm not!!
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Yes, but for the last time.
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Okay fine, now Ross...
Oh, but-but I can't do it.
Because it's too delicious.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Why, why not?
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
So what does this mean?
And?
Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
Stick to your side!
I can give it a shot.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Hey, come on now!
All right, what are we havin'?
Well, thank you for lunch.
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
We'll see.
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Yay!!
Let's do it! Ross?
Lose the other guys.
Nono, just you.
Whaddyou mean?
...Like, ...all of them?
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Oh, seriously you want him?
No, I got him.
No, seriously.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, I don't know, a million?
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
I'm fine.
Oh uh, o, OK.
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
Oh that's me, I gotta go.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
Happy New Year!
Yeah!
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year, Pheebs!
I also said, "Yes!"
Yes.
Dude you said, "No!"
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
No! Ahhh!!!
What's up with the simian?
Do you have a point?
You know, you think I would.
It's just a fur ball.
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
Wait, we can't do this.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Hee hee!
Why?
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
So are we...friends again?
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
No problem.
Yeah.
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
Do you want me to call?
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
I will.
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
What is your job?
Can we start over?
No, no... how come you are working here?
Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
No, no, no!
That's what I did. Wah-pah!
Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
You can't do anything!
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Oh, okay, time's up!
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
All right, I got 48.
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
'Cause I was sitting there.
You're in my seat.
How is this your seat?
But then you left.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
I can't believe you came back.
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
Hi.
Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Rachel! Rachel!
Well, this is much better.
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
So, here's somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
He cut off his ear.
Phoebe knows about us!
Joey!
Yeah?
Well I didn't tell them!
Them?! Who's them?
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
My God! What did you order?!
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
So what are you going to do?
Easy tiger.
I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
What?
Hey! How's the boat?!
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Ahoy!
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Nope, not under here!
Okay!
Emily?!
You didn't find her?
No, I've looked everywhere!
Bullies, big bullies.
You burn your mouth?
Cannot feel my tounge.
Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
You are really frightening me.
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
Hello, Chandler Bing.
So what, we just sit?
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
OK, let's do it. What?
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
And we're changing.
Hey, you feelin' better?
Oh, she's goin' somewhere.
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
So, do you have any other possibilities?
Does anybody know me?!
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
You're not a lefty?
What's wrong Phoebe?
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
They'll never understand!
All right.
No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
What happened? What happened?!
Umm, well, he's...
He's doin' some thinkin'!
You kissed my girlfriend!
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
All right, rock on.
We'll be there.
Great. I'll ah, see ya then.

He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'
Well, I feel like a snack!
Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
Joey, no means no!
That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
Hey!
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Who are those people?
Aww, look at the little thing.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Got me.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
I can check that for ya.
What?
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Okay, so he's out of here.
YES!!
Uh fellas,
Um-hmm.
Hey!
Ooh, you almost had it.
Ok, this could be tough.
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
No no, you're fine, you're fine.
Hello
What's the matter honey?
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
Oww!
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
It starts?
An old cookie?
No one got me an engagement present.
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
I'm going to the bathroom now.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
Meet me in the bathroom.
C'mon.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Oh, great. This is just...
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Okay, what do you guys think?
Chandler!!
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
Dude!
I have never known love like this.
It doesn't scare me!
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
You probably want us to move in together?
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Staying out of the way.
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
What is your job?
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
There were only twelve.
So, uh, how was he?
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.
Eh.
Eh?
Cool, girl roommate.
I knew it!
I don't care, I'm not going anywhere.
Well?
Nope, not knocked up yet.
Oh yeah, that looks good.
Ahhh.
Okay.
You guys make a very attractive couple.
Yeah, we look great together.
Work on your music?
Oh, the guys are here.
this summer?
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.
Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Okay, one thing at a time.
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Ohh.
Ahhh!
Are you gonna play?
What is the matter with you?
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
Oh my God! Joey!
Ugh!
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
Totally crazy stupid.
What we did last night was....
Stupid.
What were we thinking?
I'm coming over tonight though, right?
It's me. I'm the other guy.
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Who?
What?
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
We have good news, look whose back!
Hi!
That's right, she came back all by herself.
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Again, it's not that he...
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Okay, good luck with that.
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Hey!
Hi!
How could it not matter?!
What?! Why did you do that?
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
I would love to do it together!
They're gonna do it together.
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
No-no-Really?!
So- you can tell?
Really.
Yeah.
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
It's throwing and catching!
I'm not a dropper!
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
All right.
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Batman has the Batmobile!
Batman has a utility belt!
007 has a fancy car!
007 gets all the ladies.
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
I can't believe I ruined this.
Well where... Where did she go?
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
I am so sorry man.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
He took my essence!
Where's my underwear?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
I would love to!
Oh good!
Oh good.
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
Hello! Little ones.
Oh God.
Oh, you're such a cheater!
Hey!
Hey!
Did she freak out?
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Well, she saw the ring.
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Right.
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
Hi.
Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.
With extra pulp?
No!
I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Yeah!!
No!
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
So you like it?
Woah, hey, yo.
Hey you.
Hey you.
So, uh, how was your day?
Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
Hey! What are you guys doing?
That is so unfair!
Not really, I got to drag him around too!
Hey.
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
Now get on out of here, you!
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
It's an old key!
This is not a sign!
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
Oh my God it's old!
I love you!
Actually, I don't like martinis.
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Ooh, yum!
Your tax dollars?
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Yeah, okay.
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Let's have Monica decide.
It's my joke.
Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I see where you're goin'!
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
What's up with the greed Joe?
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
Do we pay for this?
Hey!
Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
I wanna quit the bank!
Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. Would you come over here please?
Hi, I'm Karen.
Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set.
Which smells delicious!
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
That's my pie!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
What?
What are you doing out there?
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
Oh, yeah, I do.
I am, uh, I am...
Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
Lick away my man.
So I got ya something.
Plastic spoons. Great.
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
What?
We already knew that!
Hey!
Hey!
I'm having a son. Um...
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Well, Joey's my best friend.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
I'm not your best friend?
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Ten dollars an hour for what?
Oh, this is soo bad.
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
I am!
Joey!!!
No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
Let me try it on!
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
Hey there you are!
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Oh no, no, no, no.
Well, can you dance at all?
Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
What, what is that?
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
You wanna hug it out?
Okay. Thanks.
Okay!
Yeah!
Yay!
Look, maybe we should go?
No?
That's what I said.
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
Great!
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
So what are you gonna do?
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
Feminist issue. That's where I went!
She is gonna hate me.
Always illegal Joe.
Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight.
Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
Aah, y'killing me!
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Nice shoes, huh?
Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
So, I guess this is over.
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Yeah, it did.
What?
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
Three.
That's kinda nice.
Yeah.
You wanna see if we still have it?
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
It's a buffet man.
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Sure! What's up?
Monica and I almost got married last night.
So what was it for anyway?
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
I wanna say a disease.
Hey!
It's the Miracle Wax.
She laughed at you?
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
It certainly is a miracle.
Hi you guys.
Well where did she go?
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Okay, she was here, but she left.
Well she said she had to think things over.
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Hey man, what's up?
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Oh, yeah, good idea.
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
Y'know I think you can take her.
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Me too!
Okay!
Really?! You?
Yeah.
Oh you knew that. Good!
Richard!
What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Can I just say one thing?
Rachel, wait, wait.
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
What? What?!
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
We're very happy for you.
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
What's the matter?!
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
Yes, he is!
What?!
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Yep, I'm in a tree.
It's gotta be the first one.
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Did he call? Did Mark call?
No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
Am I naked again?!
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
You slept with the stripper?
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
Of course!!
Hi, guys.
So, are we going in there?
Okay.
My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart!
I am!!
You're look for laughable...
Wait, wait, wait.
It's me.
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
Hi.
Erica.
All right! Let's do it!
Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Woo-hoo!!
Yeah, cheerie-o!
God that is good TV.
So what happens next?
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
Phoebs, play with meeee.
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Because, I'm too afraid.
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
I'm so sorry you're sick.
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Ohh!
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
I can't remember which sister.
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
What is the worse part?
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
Whoa! Don't know about that.
You're there!
You are ready to make a commitment!
What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Alright, so what's it about?
There's another carton right over there.
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Well I like both eggs equally.
Well, either that or uh...
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Joey!!
Yeah?
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry...
What?
I'm not Jewish, so...
Okay, come here! Come here.
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Sure! Okay, you go first.
Okay!
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Okay, on three. One....Two....
She wasn't a hooker.
Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
Why don't we just go on two.
Why two?
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
What are you doing?!
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
What the hell are doing?!!
Hmmm, that's very cool.
Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
No, no, no. No-no-no.
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
Shhhh!
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
He's Greek Orthodox.
Who is this?
I am Father Kalebasous.
As are you...
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Okay, listen Robert...
Hey, don't we have to...
Umm, I think you're really, really great...
Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
And last but not least.
And, a lemon lime.
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
Yeah, well, lucky for you.
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
You didn't even take off your pants.
What?
I don't know.
Could you want her more?
...little playthings with yarn?
What?
Who?
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Ben! Ben! Ben!
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Where's your baby?
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Bye, Pheebs!
Okay, bye!
Ohh!
Nice luggage.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy.
Hello!
Excuse me.
Your pants!
Water! Water! Water!
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
Not 700 exactly?
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Uh, wow, 700.
Yeah.
Double it!
Can I use your phone?
What?!
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
They put you in jail?
What?
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
The little jail between the doors!
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
My lighter's in there!
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
What's going on?
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
So--You got in voluntarily?!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
BEND OVER?!!!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
BEND OVER?!!!
Excellent hole, Joe.
I've got canned goods.
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Ow!! Ow!!!
I said art lover.
Art lover!
What'd you say?
Is that supposed to be an insult?
I don't know, I'm very tired.
I don't know, I'm very tired.
I said art lover.
Is that supposed to be an insult?
So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
That sounds great.
Oh, are we playing this?!
Yeah, whatever.
It's your turn.
Hey.
Hey! How'd the audition go?
What?! What-what is it?!
I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
I can't believe we're living here!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
I can't believe we live here!
Oh, she's goin' somewhere.
Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
Because she's your lobster.
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .
Hey, you feelin' better?
I'll cancel the sodas.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
What if we have to pee?
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
Isn't she cute? No!
Hi!
I'm the student.
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Oh, we're not together.
I'll give up my ticket.
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
Me too.
Okay that's so generous!
What, what's what you mean?
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
Really? Male nurses?
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Yeah, I was bummed too.
So they're going on dates? When?
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Heh, what d'ya say?
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
And that doesn't scare you?
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Ross, you need some help?
From you? Yes, please!
Hi, honey! I'm home!
When do you think we lost her?
Probably around gonorrhea.
Don't come in here!
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Do I still call you Ross?
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
Nope.
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
You know...Oh My God.
Hey.
What's up?
What happened to your teeth.
I whitened them.
Isn't that Ross's money?
Yeah.
You wanna eat? My treat!
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
I don't know.
I can't smell your sandwich?
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Did I say you could smell it?!
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
It's Clint. It's Clint!
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Umm, Gene.
See you later, Gene.
Bye, Gene.
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Yeah, you do.
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Hello, Joanna......'s office.
Yeah!
Hi! How are you?
I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
How little?!
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!
Okay, well, we won that one.
Okay, the last thing...
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
I got it! Scotch... tape.
Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
No, I'm Mary-Theresa.
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
Let me see the earrings.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Oh, honey, the earrings...
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
No, really you're gonna freeze.
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Oh, don't worry about it.
No, I'm not.
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
Joey you broke my chair!!
What? Wh-hey!
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Your chair?!
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Oh no! No! No! No!
What's going on?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Look!
You guys wanna eat here?
Yeah!
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
Yeah! As long as we're here!
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Green. To the green.
That's not a state Joe.
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
Nooo!!
You mean a three pointer?
Hey! How'd the ah, basketball go?
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
Happy birthday, pal!
You got waaaay too much free time.
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
We love you, man.
Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
It's not charity, Joe...
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
Can I uh see something?
There we go. All better.
There's my little boy.
Cool.
He hates me. My nephew hates me.
Oh o-, OK man.
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.
Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault.
I can't believe we're doing this.
I'm going to the bathroom now.
C'mon.
Alright mister, let's see those panties.
Alrighty.
Phoebs, play with meeee.
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
God that is good TV.
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
But we don't know the neighbors.
I'm sorry, who?
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
At a fake game!!
It's not a real game! I made it up!
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
What are you guys talking about?
Yeah, swing music is so out.
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
What?! Why did you do that?
You do? Why?
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
How could it not matter?!
Well the duck can swim.
There we go little fella.
What about the duck?
Oh, jeez.
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
Let them win one.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
You're not even giving them a chance!
I can't believe we live here!
What?! What-what is it?!
Did you see the size of the closets?!
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Don't read my condoms!
Condoms, dude!
How come the writing is in Spanish?
Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
Who are you saying "check" too?
No, not us... Us!
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
Hey, Rach, can I get...
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.
Did you talk to him?
Not yet.
You have to really wanna see it.
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
How is that the silver lining?
Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
You just thought of that in there?
Okay.
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
He's at a dinner party.
Because, because I've got Ben.
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
You burn your mouth?
Ah, there we go.
I think we proved our point.
Cannot feel my tounge.
Bullies, big bullies.
This took you all day?!
I am sorry, Ross.
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Oh yeah! With who?
You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Yeah.
Ring dammit, ring!
Oh my.
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Thanks.
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Could've been a peach.
-Peaches?
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
It's gotta be the first one.
Y'know which one was she again?
Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Why? What happened to him?
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
I don't care! I don't care!!
No. No! No! No!
Honey, honey, people are looking.
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
You can't leave! I have your shoe!
I-kea! This is comfortable.
Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
This place is amazing.
God, that is the nicest kitchen.
Sounds like a date to me.
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
No he didn't.
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
You really didn't have to. Wow.
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
No, I ah, I didn't do them.
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
Bing! You got those numbers for me?
Oh, you forgot?
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Now, there's two reasons.
You're a genius!
Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
Hey.
Hey!
Oh, will you give me the thing.
I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
Hi, Max!
Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
You don't even have a car!
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
And?
Oh, what a crappy night!
So...
Just us.
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Or 45.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Put Joey on the phone.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
I have no idea what you just said.
What's up man?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Tell it again. Seriously.
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
I did! I absolutely did!
There's sooo much you don't know.
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
You idiot!!
I'm sure you're right, but why?
Okay, who wore those?
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Not bad.
Well, I have a call in about that.
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
'Kay.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
She has a real name.
Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
Nana?
Althea!
Althea?! What are you doing?!
Boys? We're going in.
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
I just... can't do it.
.....Hi.
Wow. That is not a happy hi.
I'll catch you guys later.
Okay, great.
So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
Hey!
Hey!
You, you are gonna love this.
Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
Isn't Ben in this?
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
Oh, yeah!
That commercial always makes me so sad.
No, no, you don't have to see.
Chandler's wearing panties.
What? Let me see.
Hi Tushie.
Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
I'll take her back tomorrow.
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
Hey!
Uh, if you say so sir.
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Well, I'm going to kill you.
Ok, this could be tough.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
Ooh, you almost had it.
Phoebe is, making people.
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
I know. Ross is getting married.
Everybody's doing stuff!
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
...And what did you bring?
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
I know, this is a great apartment.
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
Can you believe this place?
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Oh, great!
That was unbelievable!
Okay, see? I told you!
And that's how you bought it?
When did you go to a sperm bank?
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Not if I kiss you first.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Ooh.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
You're shooting with Althea?!
Althea?! What are you doing?!
I took a shot.
Althea is correct.
Nice shooting!
How about Joey... Pepponi?
Nooo...
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Joey... Switzerland?
Your boyfriend is so cool.
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
So'd you guys have fun?
Really?
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Oh, oh, c'mon in.
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
Thanks.
I'm Tilly.
Oh.
But you're still my friend?
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
Not for the next few minutes.
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
OK, Phoebs, your turn.
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Uh-huh.
It's okay, I got a plan.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
We're gonna find love!
Definitely!
Y'know, you'd think I would've.
You're kidding.
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
...Flame Boy.
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now.
Hey!
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
London baby!!
Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.
And the bunny got away.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Sorry.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
I am, I'm ignoring you.
Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
Come on! Do something!
Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
Oh, what the hell is that?
Take off your shirt!
Oh, somebody's feeling better.
Stick out your tongue.
Oh my!!
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
No, no, no, no, no!
Set....hike!
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!
Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
You are playing American football?
Well, we could count again.
Daddy.
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
I can't believe this is happening.
You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
Should we call the spitter?
Yeah!
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Hey Rachel!
Hi!
What did you guys just do?!
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
Okay.
What happened?
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
The British are coming?
And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
Hey you guys, guess what?
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Ohh.
That, that's what's stupid.
Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Down at the docks again?
Oh, right, right, shut up.
Not a one.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
It's exactly like it sounds.
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Ohh-oh, chilling!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Borrow money from me?
I can't help it!
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Beam me up Jesus.
What?
What does the sign say?
No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
So that's the girl you like.
Hi!
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
Yeah.
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
That's a good call. Right.
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
No. No. I don't think so.
No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
What's that?
Takin' that with you, huh?
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
It's really not that big!
Oh, yeah.
You comin'?
Well maybe he was nervous.
I know.
Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
It's OK, it's fine.
What am I gonna do, huh?
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
Hey.
Hey.
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
All right, then massage me up right nice!
It's so good, isn't it?
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Man, I am so beat.
Why?
Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.
Oh yeah.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
Are you guys sure about this?
Definitely!
All right.
All right!
So uh, what are you in for?
You mind if I...
No, please.
I talk in my sleep.
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
I'm not gonna mess it up.
Yeah.
You're gonna mess it up let me do it.
If she says no, can I have the ring?
She's not gonna say no.
Okay, we owe you a present.
Really?!
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Two! I've been engaged twice!
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
To pay for the gym.
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Hey.
Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
So really, what'd ya have?
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Do you know anything about women?
Hey Joe what's up?
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Hey you guys.
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
I can see why that's hard to resist.
I said, "Like what?"
Like what?
What-what-what is so funny?
Now that's a thinker.
Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
Okay.
The reason he just said.
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Why should I help you?!
What do you need?
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
Ok, you can not do this to me.
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
The man's got a point.
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
That's true.
Oh, hi!
Hi!
Oh, you must stop shooping.
That's closer.
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
Way to be cool, man.
Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
What's he talking about?
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
Oh! It's on! It's on!
Hey!
Oh my God!
There we go little fella.
What about the duck?
I'm not getting into this again!
Well you did pull his hair.
He took my snack!
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
Dude that is so sad.
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Could I play?
Is that your new walk?
Maybe she killed him?
Let's go.
No, I really have to pee.
Can I see the comics?
Oh, the tears are real.
Pretty cool, huh?
You're fake laughing too, right?
You look beautiful this evening.
Show me the badge again.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Really?! You promise?
Okay. I love you so much.
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Don't play with his things.
You told on us?
Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
I know.
Alright, let's take this outside.
What-what 'cha doin'?
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
Checking to see if it's even.
'Kay.
So, is Janine around?
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Sure, neighbor come on in.
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Oh, good. Rog is here.
And Rog.
C'mon up.
What's the matter with Rog?
Yeah.
What about that circled one?
Not even on page 7?
Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
But it's available now! Isn't it?
She's just doing her job!
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
You sick bastards!
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
He thought you said gonad.
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
What?
Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
Oh, Larry.
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Oh, okay, time's up!
All right, I got 48.
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Is anybody else scared?
Hang up, hang up.
'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
There we go little fella.
Oh my God!
Oh! It's on! It's on!
What about the duck?
Well the duck can swim.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Uh, good.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
I want you to say that you like her!
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Look, what do you want me to say?
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Is there a puppy here?
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
You don't like puppies?
Okay, you are new!
I can't believe it! We're here!
It's Le Poo.
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
This is going in your book?
Why would the little girl creep you out?
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
What?! Excuse me!
I paid for those tickets!
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Oh yeah!
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
Well, thanks again for lunch.
It was, wasn't it?
The food there was, was great.
What stupid thing did you do?
What's goin' on?
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
Bon giorno tutti!
Ewww!
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Yes have you seen any?
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
A monkey.
No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Oh, how well you know me...
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
How'd you pay for them?
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Okay, I gotta go to work.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Okay.
Nope.
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
What if Joey were president?
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
How do you know that? How?
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
So, did you do it?
Uh-oh, it was bad?
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Then...who did?
Uh-huh.

But I think we should tell her.
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Good! That's good!
You wanna quit?
I wanna quit the gym.
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Nice to meet you too.
So, are you ready to go?
It was a car backfire!
Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
My God, Joey!
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Yeah, I didn't know that.
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
Well, this is much better.
So, here's somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
No one got me an engagement present.
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
That was there when I got here.
Ok, you can have it.
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
We've got to do something!
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
What?! What is it?!
Sounds like a fun party.
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
Our next cocktail party?
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Your liking it, huh?
I'll just throw them out.
These little women. Wow!
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
Why haven't you told them?!
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Man, I gotta get a kid.
Yeah.
You have a play date with a stripper?!
Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
Sure, is she married?
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
All you had to do was buy the card!
Althea?! What are you doing?!
She has a real name.
Althea!
I took a shot.
You're shooting with Althea?!
Oh they didn't want to come!
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
Where were your parents?
Oh Chandler!
Poor thing!
Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Ah, poke a nose, mmm
So, did I hear Poconos?
Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Ah, finally an explanation.
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Joey!
Can I finish my story?!
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Do you want me to pick you?!
See, I would never snap at you like that.
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
Your own boat?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
What?
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
What are you guys doing together?
We're baack!
Hey!
Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
Really.
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
And why not?!
You're-you're what?!
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
Pretty good! I told her.
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Well, howdya feel?
Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
You have to pick your moments.
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
Did I miss it, did I miss it?
She's not even here yet.
You're naked in this picture!
Hey.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
I know.
Ross?
This, this actually is a...
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
Hey!
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
Oh, that was my work laugh.
What?
That noise you just made?
Really? Your work laugh?
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
Who the hell is Carl?!
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Eh!
Hey!
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
Eh..., I don't, I don't know.
Gimme the this!
Let go!
What?
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
Can you people not see me?!
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Yeah. Sure.
So, will you talk to him?
I don't know Rach.
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Unbelievable
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
And was the curse lifted?
Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake.
Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
No not Candy Lady.
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Candy Lady?
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
That's what they'll call us.
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
You have dinosaur checks?
So, we gettin' a fish?
Bye-bye.
Bye.
You had sex with her didn't you?
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
Die Hard still great!
Huh, good luck!
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
What'd you rent?
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Dawson?!
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
What are you in love with her or something?
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
Who are you going out with?
How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Oh, is this the bug lady?
Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
Oh that's great! Good for you.
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
Chandler, is that...
Hey-hey listen...
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
GET OUT NOW!!
I didn't realize that.
Yeah.
Ok, you really want me out?
Yes please.
Oh come on you big faker!
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Not now, I'm sick!
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
That's not specific to girls.
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
Hey! How'd the audition go?
Oh, are we playing this?!
Hey.
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
You are so great! I love you!
This is not going to work.
I bet this will work!
What?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
I got it! Scotch... tape.
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!
No-no, not for like another two weeks.
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
How's your room Rach?
Oh, how bad is it?
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Isn't that mine?
I thought your time ran out.
Joey! Joey!!
Yeah?
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
God, I love these fingers...
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
Thank you.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
Man, she is really gullible.
I'll get back to my new job.
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
Here you go.
Thanks!
You're definitely scaring here.
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
There you go!
Would you like to call somebody?
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
No, no, this is the first time.
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
Ohhhh!
Joey! You didn't even know her!
Y'know that wasn't part of it?
Okay.
Ow!
I know!
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
So ah, whatcha watching?
What? I'm just said.
No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
Baywatch.
What's it about?
Hey, big guy, game time.
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
Hey, be right there.
There's a game?
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Chandler.
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
All right, I'll pick that one.
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
Ohhh!
Okay, here is the phone bill.
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Ahhh.
Oh my God!!
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
Stay out of my freezer!
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
She said she'd call me.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Ohh!
Oh God.
Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
Thanks.
So, I guess this is it.
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
Well, I've got a girl in here.
No time for that!
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
So whaddya got there Monica?
How do you know exactly what she's going through?
She told us.
Just some stuff for the party.
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
Whoa, snowing out there?
Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
No.
Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
I've got canned goods.
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Ennnh.
Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh, so that's what this is for.
Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.
Ooh, this is it, 74.
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
Yeah.
Oh, we could do this all day.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
Do you not see it?
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
....................Yeah.
Hey.
I'm not breaking up with her!
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
God, look what I found in the drain.
What?!
I'm afraid I might just be.
It means we're holding hands.
Are you the cutest?
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Well, you're amazing.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
What've you been up to?
I got a little drunk...and naked.
Bob here.
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
Glass, sand, whatever.
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
What?!
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Should we do something?
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Yes that was a nice place!
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Yeah!
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Well, I, I should go in there.
Why not?
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
Why not?
But, I never left the room!
I mean, I was sitting there.
But, you got up!
But, you left the chair area.
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
Did you not understand the story?
Oh yeah?
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Hey!
Hey! What's up?
What the hell is going on?!
Open up! Open up! Open up!
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
We took our apartment back!!
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
You're a little high maintenance.
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Ahhh! You are on my list.
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
I'm gettin' my chair back!
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Noo! Angels.
What? Wh-hey!
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Uh, could you leave me one?
They're in my bag over there.
Ah.
For just you?
Yeah.
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
Hey, where's his thing?
Chandler's a girl!
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Okay, keep saying it!
And, a lemon lime.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
You got me a cola drink?
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
And last but not least.
Well that's a full cup!
You're kidding right?
No. Why?
Damn! I am good at Cups!
I'm not talking to her!
It is so good to see you!
That's right, she came back all by herself.
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
They're still just friends, right?
Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
And I will see you tomorrow!
That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Are you intrigued?
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Oh.
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Okay.
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Yes! You're never gonna make it!
What about the time difference?
From here to the airport?
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
I-I-I don't know.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
How do you feel?
Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Really?! How much?!
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
Two hours, that lasted!
Oh.
No he doesn't!
So did you break up with Joanna?
I think so.
Uh, yes, yes it is.
Ahhhh.
Uh, is your name Chandler?
Chandler Bing?
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
She's there?!
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Ross, take me off speakerphone.
Well, those were seals, man.
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
Yeah.
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
And this- is my reward!
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
No! No! Not, Paris.
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
When?
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
Oh! Yeah!
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
...everyone, this is Chandler!
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
So you're really okay with this?
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
What? What? Why?!
Alright, we're gettin' closer.
How far'd ya get?
Mailbox.
Uh-huh.
Phoebs, what's goin' on?
There you go! There you are!
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
I-Ohh!
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
This is Patrick.
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
New York.
I'm not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?
Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
In...in two weeks.
What are you guys doing out here?
What code?
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Me! On my computer.
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
Well you sure used a large font.
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Well, you-you know what I meant.
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
So what job did you get Joe?
Love your condoms my man.
Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
Hi!
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Not once did we do that.
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Hi.
Hey!
I'm sure you're right, but why?
I did! I absolutely did!
You idiot!!
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
You can't just call Monica's room.
YEAH!!! YES!!!
I call Monica's room!
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Yeah.
Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Well, so why not go knock?
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Well, like father, like son.
Thanks. I think you got it!
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Well, what did the police say?
What's wrong buddy?
Someone at work ate my sandwich!
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Oh, is that against the rules?
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
No, but it is frowned upon.
I see.
No, did he hug you?!
No. How are ya Paul?
Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Where's my seat belt?
OK. Brake left, gas right?
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
Hey!
What... did you get me there?
What?
What?
I got you...these.
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Thanks again.
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
No, inside good, outside bad.
Okay, so when do you want to go?
Rent?
Yes! Rent!
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Here we go, here we go.
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
All right, I'm going. I'm going.
Rossy, Rossy.
She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
What?
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
"Happy Birthday Peehe."
I hope it's okay.
Oh...
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
Mm! Night Gar'!
Um-hmm.
Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
So did you read your evaluation yet?
No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
OH MY GOD!!!
Isn't he an architect now?
Yeah, they still wear underwear.
WHAT?!!
Are you all right?!
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Okay.
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
WHAT IS IT?!
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
Yeah! Right!
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
I-I-I don't know.
He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
I'm gonna put on some music.
No, I want this to happen.
So do I.
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
You look good.
He started mine first!
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
Whoa! Big octopus.
Dude, don't do that too me!
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
And then Joey remembered something.
I was in too much pain.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
You're turning into a women.
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Op, op, I'm convinced!
No!
Oh, just do it!!
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Huh.
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
It's textbook.
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Can I sleep on your couch?
What?
Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
Rachel?
No, actually Laurie's a boy.
Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Hey!
She was not good. Not good.
She was...
Awful! Horrible!
She was nothing compared to you.
She, she was different.
You hear that? We're the guys.
Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
We're the guys.
With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Whoa.
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
Hey! How'd the interview go?
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
Okay.
Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
I call Godfather!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
I'm not even... I'm not even...
I can't believe you're not picking me.
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Yes! Shame about you man.
Youre not gonna lose him.
Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Yeah. Okay.
Oh no, you'll have to come.
No!
So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
I can't believe the guys missed this.
That was amazing!
Excellent, that was excellent.
What guys? Oh, yeah.
Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
Well then why can't I see it?
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
There are seven?! That's one?
Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
It's kind of an important one!
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
I have not been sick in over three years!
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
Could there be more Kims?
Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
With such a sad history.
Who's out there?
It's me! Good morning!
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
All right!
Hey, do we do this too much?
Yeah.
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
Paid your phone bill?
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Sure.
Not so much.
Hey.
Our guy smells incredible.
Our guy has great hair.
My guy has great teeth!
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Hey.
But then later that night...
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Oh.
Yeah baby!
Hey!
No freakshow, she's fictional.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Really?
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
Thank you.
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
Hey.
Huh.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
That's still in there?!
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Yeah, but this is
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Well, you're gonna.
Quick! What time is it?!
You have no trouble telling time now right?
No!
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Die Hard!!!!!!
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Well, John McLane had plans!
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Might wanna try Joseph.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
You know, I think I might just.
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
Bye. Are you still out there?
I-I think we have too.
Okay. Bye.
No.
Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
Stop talkin' to your men.
Hey, save us some pizza.
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
Yes! And the table is mine.
Congratulations.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Thank you.
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Ooh, let me talk to him!
They got a breakfast buffet.
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
Oh-oh, my God!
Well, can I just...
Do you have my credit card?
Joey!
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
Thank God!
That new mountain bike?
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
No.
No.
Well what did you send?
Oh my God, introduce us!
Oh my God, Jill!
Oh my God, Rachel!
This is Chandler.
Hi!
Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
Hey.
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
Yes, I realise that.
Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
How can you not know which one?
I mean that's unbelievable.
Well it's not Sean Penn.
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
We don't need to remedy that.
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
Oh yeah, it'll be fun.
What was that?
Well, only if you order stuff.
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Hello! One marriage please!
Please, please take him too.
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!
Yep, we wanna get married!
Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.
Oh, okay. Send her in.
And to you too, Helen.
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Hi.
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
Oh, okay. Send her in.
Hi.
You wanted to see me?
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Joey was in a porno movie.
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
Huuh.
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
No. How are ya Paul?
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
Rachel?
Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
No, did he hug you?!
That was pretty intense huh?
Okay.
Come on.
Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
I hope he did!
I didn't know you had another level.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
I know! Neither did I!
Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Janice is gonna go away now.
Rach, come see who's out here!
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
I'll be right back.
Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Wow! Look at them run.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Yeah, I'll go get one.
Why is your family Ross?!
Yes!!
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Huh! Where is the dog?!
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Ohio!! Thank you!
What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Yeah that dog left!
You left a shoe here?!
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
I don't know... um, Grease?
Sure...
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
No....
Rent?
What is the matter with you ?!?
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Ohh, I love birds.
What?
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
It's throwing and catching!
All right.
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Oh my-Oh good God!
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
What gay thing?
How do Monica and Phoebe know?
You don't have it.
I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.
Go on.
I know, but just let me say it.
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Oh my God!
Oh my God, Richard.
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
You totally screwed him over.
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
What?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
They got a breakfast buffet.
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
It's 9:30 in the morning!
Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
Ooh, let me talk to him!
But I love swing music!
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
You know?!
What?
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
You don't know?
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
Really?
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
I thought you could use the help.
Coffee in a fight!
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
B-bye!
Bye-bye.
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
We're not gonna lose to girls.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Hey! It's 42-21!
This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
The hot chicks?
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
All right, call it in the air.
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
You got a better idea?
Heads.
Heads it is.
You did look like an idiot.
I'm over here big guy.
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Yeah that's the same.
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Already?!
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
What? It's, it's just a phase.
Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
When did that happen to you?!
...so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera!
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Can I give you a present now?
Happy plane-aversary.
Aww! I love you!
Okay!
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
Your work makes me sad.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
Okay, let's play my game now.
What about things that are already gold?
Ahh, his work is done.
Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
So you didn't mean any of that?!
What?!
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
No you robot!!
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
You call that delicious?
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Ooh.
What?
There's no back to this couch!
Hey!
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Wow! Just like in the pros.
Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
Huddle up.
All right, huddle up, right over here.
I did pay for half of it.
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
Oh my God, I'm late.
Okay.
Don't go.
But are you sure you can do this?
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Thank you.
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Well then maybe you should take it.
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Well that's how I feel.
Well then maybe I will.
Fine with me.
Well, it still has to go, right?
Really?
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Why?
Okay, it's um...
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
Who?
The what?
The abridgment.
No, we only went out once.
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
You dated her!
Not once!
Well, that makes me feel so good.
Eh?
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Bumpy?
God!! What am I gonna do?!
I know, I remember that!
I remember you did.
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Why are you screaming and hugging?
What make you think I can?!
Okay. Okay. Ace!
Because we won our apartment back!
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
Yeah?
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Not if you're gonna be like this!
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Hey!
Hey!
: I thought we had them!
You got me.
: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Wow umm, calm down.
Later!
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
Why are so mad at him?
Wow, he looks so normal.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
He's even kind of cute.
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Oh, it's perfect!
How about you?
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
We are bad people.
Kill me. Kill me now.
But you found me!
Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Well is she...
Sorry.
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
Yeah! All right! You go first.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah?
Okay, okay, I'll go first.
Okay.
All right buddy, way to go!
That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
Yes!!
Dude, what are you doing?
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
I got the time to get to know Julie.
Well, that could take a while.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
I got time.
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
You're Lewis Posin.
Who?
No! No! No! I can't do that!
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
Why not?!
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
7:15. Watch doesn't work.
One.
One.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
Look. Look, I wasn't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
Joey, I saw you push him!
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
You pushed him!
Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
Yes, and that's why we're here.
Let's do this alright.
Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
Your last roommate's kidney?
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
Who is it?
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I think I'm gonna cry!
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
I know.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
That's cool.
But, we'll stay here with you.
So uhh, how's the palace?
Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom.
Hey.
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Lets not do that any more.
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Yeah.
Hey guys! Hey!
Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
And the Knicks rule all.
I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Huh.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
All right, maybe I should call her.
Did she call?
No, sorry.
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
The one time they're not home.
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Let's get out of here.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
Okay, the old hug and roll.
Yeah.
Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Yep.
Okay, one question.
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
Oh, so you're divorced?
No.
No, I'm still married.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Hey, what's goin' on?
What?
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Kinda. They're really big.
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
What?
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
I know. I hate that!
Dude!
Okay, but now see you're crying!
I don't like your massages.
See? It's no big deal.
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
What?
How about those three pointers?
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh...
Amazing!
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Please tell me you got the message!
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
Hey!
What message?
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
See, I told you they don't swim.
I don't know. Should we try it?
Sure.
Wait. Give him a minute.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
Do either of you have the keys?
No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
The oven is on.
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
I'd love it if you would do it.
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
Really? I can do it?
Hey!
But those are the words! Those exact words!
Who said anything about Christmas?
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Hi.
Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
Hey!
How'd it go?
Oh good!
She is now.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
No.
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
There you go.
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
God?
It was you, pal.
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Ok, well, this was very special.
Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Hi, Monica.
Rach, come see who's out here!
Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Well, did-did you correct him?
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
The man is showing brain.
No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
What?!
Are you sure? Hold on. I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
Coffee.
It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
I'm sorry man.
Oh, well thank you in advance.
Okay.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
They're in my bag over there.
No! No! No!
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
Ah.
Uh, could you leave me one?
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
You're on!
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
Huh.
I got you a present!
I know, but you have to open it today!
Okay.
As crazy as soccer?
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
You mean you didn't get it from this?
What we did last night was....
Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.
Stupid.
Totally crazy stupid.
...and then it got canceled.
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
Oh, it looks great!
Well, I could cut it.
Really?! You do that?
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
Well...I'd better get going.
Could you not look?
I don't want to look.
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
What?
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
A pen.
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Why not?
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
And I think Ross is generous too.
Me too.
Okay that's so generous!
Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
Great.
Guys guys, check this out.
He-he-he, how's it goin'?
Hey nice boobs.
Excellent.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
He should take the sack?
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Ok, you win.
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
I do NOT want this unit!!
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
Fine!
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Hey!
Okay.
...Take off their hats!
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
No way. No way did you do this.
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Thanks for being born.
And I just want a million dollars!
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Rachel?!
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Our next cocktail party?
There is no alley behind Macy's.
So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
You mean you didn't get it from this?
As crazy as soccer?
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
So what job did you get Joe?
Well, you-you know what I meant.
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Yes that would be lovely.
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Really?
Yes!
My friend's name is Joey.
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.
So what are you guys going to do?
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
Man, didn't she like just get here?
Where is Emily?
Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
Yeah!! Yeah!
Easy tiger.
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Yeah, you didn't get one.
Yeah!
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
So uh, which one is mine?
I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
Uh-huh.
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one.
Ohh yes.
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Where in Cuba?
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
I'm a little busy here Paul.
Yeah?

Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
Fears and Pet Peeves.
Tails!
It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.
What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?
Animals dressed as humans.
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Uh, hey!
What's going on?
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
Yeah that's better than my way.
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
I know, but just let me say it.
Oh my God, Richard.
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
Monica! Chandler!
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
Yes. Right where?
In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
And the sex?
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
I love you. And I know about the baby.
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
What baby?
Our baby.
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Step away from the duck.
Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next.
Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
Ooh, sorry little Mr. Chic-A-Dee, sorry you went doody in my hand! Well, I guess we're not going out anymore. Whaa!!!
Joey!
Why don't you open with a joke?
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
No, no he went for a walk.
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Hey, is Chandler here?
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
Hi!
Oh no, you see, actually it is.
It is?
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
Oh, no I don't.
So you really OK about all this?
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Hi guys.
I didn't know it was a big secret.
What!
Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
You have a third nipple?
How did you? How? How?
So, I hear you're single now...
Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much.
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
Hey!
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
What?!
Wherever! I've got like 20!
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
Sure! Where are the seats?
So, will I like any of these guys?
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Too bad, she's leaving.
Don't go.
Okay. Oh no, I have to.
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Joey's not going.
I didn't finish my five pages.
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
I don't care, she slept with me.
What do you mean?
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Oh, what a crappy night!
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
So, do we have the best friends or what?
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Its still there!
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Hey, what did your agent say?
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
What, forget it!
More so than anything else.
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
Was I talking to her about gas?
I-I-I found it interesting.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
What?!
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
Here we go! Here we go!
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
Hey!
Hey!
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...
But, we'll stay here with you.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
That's cool.
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Now you do that, you're on TV.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can't do it!
Hey!
Hey!
How is that ever going to happen?!
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
I know why!
Y'know, I've had dates like this.
Get your hands out of there! No!
Let me see! Show them!
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
Uh-oh, tunnel.
What?!
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
You promised you would break up with her!
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
No no no!
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
What?!! That's even worse!!
How is that worse?!
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
Fine!
You give me back my Walkman!
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
Okay everyone, think thick.
Good-bye! Good luck!
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
I'm never gonna find love again.
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Yep, yep...You?
Well...I'd better get going.
Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Here it is! Here it is!
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
All right!
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
It's a four.
Hey Mon, how's it going?
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
Hi!
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
Really? Right across the street?
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Yeah!
When'd you meet her?
I don't know. Should we try it?
Chicks don't swim.
Are you sure?
Sure.
See, I told you they don't swim.
No one was around to hear that?
Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
So what'd he say?
Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
Oh my God, how did you do that?
So, how many have you sold so far?
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
He's taking off her coat!
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
Oh, this is just terrible.
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
How long have we been home?
Did you know he was in there?
No.
About a half an hour.
Lovely!
What in God's name is that?!
Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Okay!
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Well it's not flexed right now!
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
This bicep?
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Well you did pull his hair.
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
He took my snack!
I'm not getting into this again!
Our guy has great hair.
Our guy's a great dancer!
My guy is well read.
My guy has great teeth!
Our guy smells incredible.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Ohh. Mmm.
Hi.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Settle what?
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
What do we do? What do we do?
Wellll?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
Like an eclipse.
...little playthings with yarn?
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
What?
Could you want her more?
Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Okay, sure.
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
It's called the cherry.
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
Hey.
You mean that?
Yeah? How'd it go?
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
You want me to wear your panties?
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
Could ya?
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
Bob here.
Oh, hi.
Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.
So, uh, how was he?
Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
Oh, good.
Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
Okay.
Okay. Four.
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Uh, yes.
So what happened?
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
What? That's terrible!
No-no, we do it every year!
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
You look cute in bubbles.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
I've had a very long, hard day.
Just a little bit of sugar.
So how do you kids like your coffee?
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
Umm, where's my purse?
Shoot! We're out of soda.
Really?!
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
That's me.
I'm him.
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Yes, every single one of them.
Yeah.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
What's up?
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
What do we use to split it?
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
We're notwe're not saying anything.
OK.
Shut up!
What?
Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
I'm sorry..
I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Well, I've got a girl in here.
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
And this- is my reward!
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Ohhh! Put it out!
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Do we have to make the entire thing?
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
Oh, yeah.
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
It doesn't say that. Does it?
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Ah!
This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
Okay.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
I'm fine.
All right.
Wait here. Breathe.
How do you do that?
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Then what is it?
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
You are a frightening, frightening man.
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
Uh-huh.
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
Joey, why is your cable out?
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, it's in there.
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
No! No! No! I was so careful!
Really?
Yeah she said something about crumbies.
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
This is for the fourth grade.
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.
What, what's what you mean?
For an emergency just like this.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
I swear you said you had the keys.
That's easy, baggage claim.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
No, no, no, you say that proudly.
Yeah.
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
How do you know so much about this?
Yes! Santa's coming!
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
I don't know.
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
What?
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
I am pretending.
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!
Oh no! An asteroid!
Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
It's like this, me, no jokes.
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Wow! What's that like?
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Then all your stuff would be here.
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
'Kay!
Bye.
No-no, she really is sick!
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Oh! Pathetic!
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
What's goin' on?
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Really?!
Would you please get some rest!
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
I'm fine.
"Happy birthday to you!"
The food there was, was great.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
It was, wasn't it?
Wasn't it?
So take care.
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Ross's parents are my parents!
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Well this is just sad!
You wanna see if we still have it?
Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
Yeah.
Yeah.
FREE PORN!!!
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
Hi.
Chandler!
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
You don't need to fill these silences.
Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
No, that's all right.
No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man.
No, you should.
Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Nooo!
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
Look out kids, he's coming!
I'm gonna get back to retraining.
All right, see you guys.
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
'We' would be me and Rick.
Who's Rick?
And, we're done with the yogurt.
Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
Sorry.
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
Oo! When's her birthday?!
Because the kids need new shoes.
Monica's making jam.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
This will just be my batch.
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Hey Pheebs?
Oh hi!
Ohh, uh-huh so much!
Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
Y'know, I don't see that happening?
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
Hello?
It's Phoebe.
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Hate that guy!
Night, you guys.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Nooo!
And it works both ways.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Have you ever been with a woman?
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Well that sounds fun too.
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
So there is no good time to ask that question.
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
No, never done that either.
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
That's right.
What's up Joey?
Believe me, sometimes that happens.
Oh Mom!
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
Really?
I found a dried up seashores.
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
Sweety, what are you talking about?
Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!
Well, where's the logic in that?!
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
Happy plane-aversary.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
I remember when we first got engaged.
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
What?
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
And now you're giving me the message!
Hey!
So uh, Emily called last night...
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
God, Susan is so fun!
Weird world. Your kids?
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
I figure my character has kids.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
I'm Monica.
Okay.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
What?!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Oh and you know what I want!
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
Morning.
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
I hope she throws up on you.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
So...
Just us.
Yeah let's head off to work.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
We should go.
Thank you.
Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
Hello! Hello!
Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.
Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Oh.
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
It's hard for some people!
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Hey!!!
This is the New York Times.
No, I really have to pee.
Can I see the comics?
Okay, may I see the comics?
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
I'm not yanking you.
This is Janice.
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
I'm not breaking up with her!
Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
Hi!
Well?!
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
Well what is it?!
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
So, what did you guys think?
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
Ohhhh...
That's nice.
So, you feel like a dad yet?
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
No, why?
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
I'm sorry but...nothing.
What?
Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
Yeah, cheerie-o!
London baby!
London baby!!
Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
So?!
So?
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Well I like both eggs equally.
Alright, so what's it about?
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Yes, include more people in this.
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
He just said, "No strippers."
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Yeah.
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Okay, here we go...
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
Yeah, they're mine.
Why are they here?
I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
You need to give him money.
Give him money? It was a joke!
We don't have to come up with this now.
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Totally!
Oh good.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Yeah.
All right, let's show them how it's done.
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
Are you okay?
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
Last time I do that, I promise.
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Who was that?
Turns out he is kinda funny.
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
Okay! See you later!
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
Basically we just feel that he's...
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
I dunno, there's just something about...
We hate that guy.
Yeah. Hate him.
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
But we can go, right?
Yes.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Condoms?
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
Oh my God! My dog died!
We have free porn here!!!
FREE PORN!!!
Yeah!!
Hey!
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
All right.
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
Are you okay?
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
I bet he can.
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
You got a job?
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
Oh, how well you know me...
I was not and oh God, shh!
What's going on?
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
You really think that is what he meant?
What, what, what?!
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Done.
Not even on page 7?
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
What about that circled one?
I used to have that bumper sticker.
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
You see what I mean.
Stopped for a Chunky.
No, we'd just like to close them.
Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
No-no.
Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. Would you come over here please?
Hi, I'm Karen.
You still can't stand her can you?
Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
Then what is it?
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Okay.
Turn! Turn!
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
Yeah.
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
When did I try to give you money?
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
Look, are you gonna be ok?
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
What?
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Hmm? Oh, yeah.
Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Nooo, four.
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Okay, I gotta go to work.
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
I know, I still am one of these.
Thanks.
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Ross, can I?
The head, the head. You gotta...
You mean like for award shows?
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
Some of them.
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
What's up with the simian?
It's just a fur ball.
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Here's your lemonade.
I didn't order lemonade.
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
I got the job!
That's great! Hey! Excellent!
All right, I'm nine years old.
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Oh, I hate this story.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
More coffee over here, please!
Well, he made a move on me.
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
Well, what happened?
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
That was like 5 years ago.
Yuck!
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Yeah you got 5 years left!
Joey...
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
It's cute, huh?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
Oh, well no problem there.
You look beautiful. Is this new?
Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
I love you sweetheart.
Not now.
Okay.
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
I miss you too!!!!
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
This is it! This is my category.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
A two and a five.
Really?!
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Okay.
In a foreign, romantic country...
Seven times!
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
I blame London.
Bad London!
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
Susan Sarandon.
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
I'm coming over tonight though, right?
Totally crazy stupid.
What were we thinking?
Oh yeah. Definitely.
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
And for you?
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Anything else?
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
You're building a post office?
Yeah!
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
You really like it?
Dude! How-how did you write this?
You can't do that!
If he goes first he can!
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
Nighty-nite.
Not a dad.
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
Are you actually saying these words?
What?
Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
They got a phone in there, right?
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Okay, fine.
Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Hey.
Hey.
Why, nobody good?
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
Where did you hear it from before?
I want you out.
No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
I heard that.
Your sister Joan is crazy.
How did you get in here?
If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
Yeah.
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
Oh, it's like a skit.
So, basically just a Chinese guy.
Hi Monica.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
You can't leave! I have your shoe!
I don't care! I don't care!!
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
Good-bye Chandler Bing.
Rachel has those in burgendy.
But we're not ready to tell yet!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
See now it feels like Christmas!
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
Oh, here.
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Something else I might have said?
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
It means we're holding hands.
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
What does she mean by HH?
Are you the cutest?
I'm afraid I might just be.
All right! I found one that fits!
And?
I've had better.
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
Whose is it?
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Okay, see? I told you!
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
They're brother and sister!!!
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
You don't think I get up when you get up?
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
Ohhh, here it comes.
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
You think?!
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
I can't believe that didn't work!
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
We were playing poker, alright...
Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Thank you.
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
And now I've picked it up again.
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
Yeah, so?
Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Well I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh! I'm getting all misty here! You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
You okay?
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life... It's raining men!
Hallelujah!
No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
Ask me what?
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Excuse me?
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Where were you?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
Oh, which museum?
No, answer his.
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
I'm not laughing.
You told her!
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Yes because uh, you look so young.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
You thought I was Rachel?
And because you're both, you know, white women.
Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Yeah?
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dead.
Hey.
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.
What's this?
Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, make that three.
Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
Robert's coming out.
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
What?
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
Oh, howd she take it?
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
What did you guys just do?!
What happened?
What?! Noooo...
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
OK, so now we draw cards.
But you could teach us.
No.
So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
Oh, good for you!
That's very funny. We done now?
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
I'm a man.
Defend yourself.
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
'Cause that's just your taste.
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
I got something for her. It's a book!
Where?
Our place, the hall! I...
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
No, why?
Then free as a bird. What's up?
Batman has a utility belt!
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
007 has a fancy car!
Batman has the Batmobile!
OK, this one right here is from me.
OK, I'm guessing this is from...
Well, thank you, Melanie.
OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!
This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
My friend's name is Joey.
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
The nerve huh?
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Done.
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
Career counselor?
I don't!
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
No, no, no.
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
It's a great idea.
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
What, what are you laughing at?
Are you serious?
We are there!
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
Hello? Hi.
Needs some clothes altered?
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
You do know that Wham broke up?
We don't make enough fun of you already?
Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
What?
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
Oh, really?
Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
I don't get this! She was horrible!
Why do you care so much anyway?
I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
What did you say?
Hi!
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
What?!
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
You got a better idea?
All right, call it in the air.
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
She has to know that your not ready.
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Really?
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Wow!
Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
Then don't leave me!
You're it! Now run and hide!
No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
What's goin' on?
It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
All right! Bring it on, you...
No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay.
Okay, guys.
Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm...
Oh my God! Play!
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
I can't believe this Chandler!
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
I remember when we first got engaged.
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
No, the little girl creeps me out.
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
You said the baby.
Why would the baby creep me out?
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Okay. See?
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
Okay, Chandler, come on!
Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Hey, I can handle it! All right?
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
What did you say?
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
What?
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
Why not?
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
Kick save and... denied.
Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
Man you are incredible.
Then I got all needy and clingy.
Uff.
That is never good.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
She said she'd call me.
Well that would help the pride thing.
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Hey!
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Finally!
What are we gonna do?
Chandler?
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
All right, I'll see you guys.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Oh! Oop!
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
Knick fan?
Might wanna open with the snowman.
Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
So, how'd it go?
Hey, how's the first day goin'?
Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Hey.
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Well there you go.
We are switching back, right now!
We took our apartment back!!
I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
What?!
I thought you knew that.
Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
What are you talking about?
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
You understood that?
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
Ok.
What did you do when they found out?
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
And protected them from a tornado?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
Oh my God.
I know, the babies are asleep.
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
Thank you.
But are you sure you can do this?
Are you hugging the door right now.
I love you!
I love you!
No.
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
I'm sure you're right, but why?
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
I know! I know!
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy.
Yeah he was wasn't he.
Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Hello, children!
Hey!
Really?!
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Santa? Really?
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Oh! Oh, God!
What is this?!
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
And this- is my reward!
The key's stuck in the lock.
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
What are you doing?
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
It still doesn't work.
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
OK.
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
Last time I do that, I promise.
Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
You are so cute.
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
Feelings, such strong feelings.
Say again?
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
F-hah.... flennin....
How do you not fall down more?
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
Well where... Where did she go?
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
I can't believe I ruined this.
What about things that are already gold?
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
Ahh, his work is done.
Okay, let's play my game now.
Where are they? Where are they?
Hey, Joey.
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Work people? Nobody told me.
Where are you going?
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Gooood morning!!
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Where you can make out with your assistant.
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
Oh.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I think it is!
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Hello Skidmark.
It's pretty clear.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
No, no, you don't have to see.
Hi Tushie.
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
Where's your baby?
Ben! Ben! Ben!
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
Does it matter?!
Could we be more white trash?
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
How desperate am I?
Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
So we both finished our vows.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
Oh that's so sweet.
Oh!
Hey!
You think we're ready for something like that?
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Yeah
Why not?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Ya know, the man's got a point.
No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
What is that sparkly thing?
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Wait! What about Joey?
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
No, no, no. No-no-no.
What are the odds? What are the odds?
Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Yay! Emily!
Okay, that-that's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
The one that doesn't.
Love what you've done with the place.
Ross?
Hey roomies!
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
You guys ready fore the movies?
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Man! They cannot get enough!
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
Just do it.
Hey!
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Fine with me!
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Yes that was mine.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Ow!
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
You built a fort didn't ya?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Kinda.
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Nope.
That's because I'm in front of them.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
More importantly, was I any good?
Exellent dream score.
Why, why, why would you dream that?
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
That is true.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
It might be kinda cool.
So I can do it?
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
Really?
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Why not?
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Ross came in forth and cried!
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Oh my God!
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
...Come on! Why are we here?!
Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
Would you like some pancakes?
Okay, okay take a guess.
The hot chicks?
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
They put you in jail?
The little jail between the doors!
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
So, uh, how often can you do it?
It did at first, but not anymore.
Chandler?
As much as he needs.
Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
And because you're both, you know, white women.
Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
Come on! I really need your help!
No-no-no-no-no!
Alright, now try taking a puff.
Hey!
Hey!
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Hi!
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Umm, cups.
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Why, exactly?
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
So, this isn't over?
And Milton Berle has a...
Go on.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Ohh, not compared to you.
Well?
I can see why that's hard to resist.
Hey Joe what's up?
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
I like her so much!
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Is she great or what?
So? Huh? What do you think?
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
My folks.
I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
What?!
Should I tell her I ordered tea?
Oh, God bless us, everyone.
Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
No.
Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
Who is it?
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Alright, what have we learned so far?
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
SURPRISE!!!
What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
There's another carton right over there.
Oh, I couldn't be happier.
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Alright, so what's it about?
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
Hi!
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
What?!
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
Good luck!
Come on, let me see that smile.
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
I don't wanna.
Please?
So you don't think I have a, a quality?
So- you can tell?
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
He is?
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
Not a dad.
So are you ok?
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
I don't know exactly.
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
Done?
Yep!
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
It's not charity, Joe...
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Uh, yeah.
What's the second part of your plan?
Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
My Saturn dealership.
Hello?
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
What... did you get me there?
I got you...these.
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
That's great.
Had the money in the wrong hand.
Okay.
How did it go?
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
No.
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
I love you.
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Excuse me. Hi.
Yes?
What do you mean, your seat?
I mean, I was sitting there.
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
What's wrong?
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Oh man!!
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
What?!
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
Yes!!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
Horrible!
No-no-no, the kiss was good.
Okay!
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
How do you know so much about this?
I don't know.
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Mustached bastard...
Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
What time is it now?
4:30.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Yes. Vividly.
Hey, there he is! There he is!
You're not on TV.
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
Hello New York!
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
I never stop thinking about it.
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Your... excuse me?
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
Uh-huh.
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
Oh, I ordered mine first.
Give it to me.
No.
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Okay!
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Wh-wh-why?!
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
Why to save your dignity my man.
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Hey guys.
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Ohh, yeah.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
YES!!!!!!!!
Okay!!!!!
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Bonjour, monsieur.
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
To Put the Camera Away!!!
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
Really? To what?
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
Stick a fork what?
Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Woooo hoooo!!!
Why, what happened?
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
What? What?
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Hey, Pheebs.
Hey.
OK, so at this point, the dealer...
OOooooo!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
I told you I should not wear this color.
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
Thanks! So are you.
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Hi.
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
So I really never get to win anymore?
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
Yes!
How much did ever really win before?
Pheebs!
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
Joey, you don't have too!
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
See ya tomorrow!
Tomorrow!
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Okay!
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
All right? What's going on?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
What?!
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?
I didn't realize that.
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
God!! What am I gonna do?!
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
Because you do.
Yeah, I know.
Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?
Oh yeah. See you guys.
Oh.... my... God.
It's not that bad.
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Oh man!
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
Why don't you just go out with her!
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
What's an identical hand twin?
What?
My identical hand twin!
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
Okey-doke.
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
No way!
Yeah! They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it!
Thanks. You ready to go?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Dude, I don't know.
She was kidding.
Yes, it is, at Office Max.
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
What did you get her?
A pen.
You got it. You got Nevada twice.
All right.
I want my turkey now!
I know.
Yeah.
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
She's just doing her job!
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
Alright.
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Really?!
Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Hey, my Father's house does that!
And, and!
Ahhhh!!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game!
Cool! I'll catch up!
Huh?
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
You're not even giving them a chance!
Let them win one.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
They have racquets don't they?!
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
It isn't?
No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
Depends on what you mean by we.
Well yeah, but then...
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
Oh great, food with hair on it.
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
We could eat the wax! It's organic.
No, not the used wax.
Because that would be crazy?
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
Uhh, no-no thanks.
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
I'll be right back. What was that?
What?
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Do we need a cake?
Yeah, whoosh!
But it's Ross.
We have to assign heads to something.
Heads it is.
Yes! Whew!
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
What's going on?
There is not one hair on that head.
Don't be too long.
Okey-dokey!
Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
No way.
I'm not answering that.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Me going out with Richard's son.
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Is he okay in there?
He's fine!
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
What?! You're going out with her again!
Going out with who?
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Yeah, that's a big step.
I know...
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Hi.
Hey!
Estelle said I didn't get it.
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Oh God, yeah.
Okay!
No-no
Air hole! Air hole!!
Okay.
Now, we'll see.
Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
I would really love it if could do both.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
All right, I...I have to ask.
What?
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
I'm afraid I might just be.
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
It could be like a big giant guy.
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Chandler-
Me neither, y'know what-
What are you mad at me for?!
Chandler-
Well Monica just told me that they don't.
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Yes, of course they like you!
Yeah, they don't like you.
Do you know why?
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
I am.
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
I can't believe she can out run you man!
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Hi!
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Okay.
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
That was Joey!
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Really?
That's right my friend. It's time for...
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
Baywatch!!
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
I think it's the dying cat parade.
His new girlfriend!
What is that?
It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
Oh my God!
I can't believe she cracked your code!
Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Could you get us a couple of beers?
Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
What's this.
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Really.
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
You mean there's more than one of us.
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
You're gonna what?
No actually, I was just going for colorful.
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
Is that supposed to be funny?
What's with this guy?
What's with you?
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Shhh.
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yeah?
Ohh, absolutely.
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
So, what do you think we should do?
I know I love you!
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
You meant sex, right?
Do you have a sec?
I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
But if we win, we get your apartment.
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Dah!!
Oooooh!
Deal!
So they're going on dates? When?
Really? Male nurses?
Yeah, I was bummed too.
I think Saturday-.
What's with him?
Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
What?
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
You are so cute.
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Thanks.
There y'go.
Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Kinda. They're really big.
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
I'm gonna call after you!
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Run, Joey! Run for your life!
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Hey! I got great news!
What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
No.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Why not?
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
OK, stop.
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Glove salesman!
Good one! Yeah.
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
Hey, what's up?
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
So uh, what did this woman look like?
That's sweet.
No, it's more like a good luck.
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
But are you sure you can do this?
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Hiya!
Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
Who cares? I repel women.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
And while we're on the subject of news..
Look, look, I have elbows!
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Well, this is just as boring in England.
Okay, how do you feel now?
Well, I like you less!
Hey.
Hey.
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
After what I did? Can you blame her?
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Oh, now I have to go!!
What?
Okay.
You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Okay, one question.
Shoot.
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
You're so pretty.
We are. He's meeting us here.
Okay, may I see the comics?
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Really?
Hey, buddy.
Hi.
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Lose the other guys.
...Like, ...all of them?
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
Nope.
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
I'm hurt.
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
Come on, tell me.
All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
So uhh, how's the palace?
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
It'll be a short one.
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Not unless different means the same.
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
He took my joke, he took it.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Why would the baby creep me out?
No, the little girl creeps me out.
You said the baby.
Why would the little girl creep you out?
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
No, only because that's the graduation song.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Well, what-what 'cha got there?
Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking...
Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
No!
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh...
Ohh, I'm sorry.
What?! Anything! Anything!
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
That's what you say at the end of a date.
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
So uh, what are you in for?
I talk in my sleep.
So why don't you give me your number?
Okay, ready?
Dying people say the craziest things.
Uh-huh, yeah.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Hey!
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
Oh, So you can move them!
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh...
No-no-Really?!
Of course!
Ohh, I'm sorry.
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
My mom will.
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Well, so what're you gonna do?
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
OK, hi again.
Hi Phoebe.
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
But, I never left the room!
But, you left the chair area.
WHOAA!!
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
See, that's why we don't let her play.
Ok, just one more point.
Score! Now can we go?
Is everything all right?
Um-hmm.
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
You bug me.
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Oh, please...
Bona sera.
He's really picky about his patients.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
Losers walk!
Yeah, losers talk!
Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! You wanna go shotgun?
Yeah!
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Well then why can't I see it?
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
But my apartment!
But the mess!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
We?
Well I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh! I'm getting all misty here! You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
You okay?
Well sensitive is important, pick him.
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Yeah.
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
Thanks.
Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
There's no dog in here.
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
What is it doing here?
You gotta let me slam the door!
What are you mad at me for?!
Chandler-
Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
Joey-
Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
Call her! Call her now!
Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Hi Chandler!
Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
What?
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong.
I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
Ready?
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Sure! What's up?
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Taste it.
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
Hey!
Hey, mister tux!
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
That-that is a good trick.
Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Howdy.
Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
Hey!
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
No! No! No!
I am proud of all my friends today.
Oh my god.
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
Your mom was arrested?
...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
You take your time.
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
And your friend Phoebe?
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
Hey!
Alright, now try taking a puff.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
Ohhhh!
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Hm-mmm.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those...
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
He's open!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
'Scuse me.
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
What's goin' on?
Oh.
Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Hi!
Hey!
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Umm, she kissed me.
What?! You kissed!
Shhhh!!!
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
That might work!
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
What's the matter Ross?
Those were like the best seats ever.
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
It was.
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Really?!
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
Yeah, I gotta go.
Hey.
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
Thank you.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Shhh.
...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
Guess who's back in show business.
Hey.
Hey.
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
The young hot ball and chain.
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Old?
That's much better.
Op! We gotta go!
Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
Well, what happened to your jam plan?
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about me having a baby.
You got a Cheeto on your face man.
Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.
Hi.
Hey.
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
Yeah.
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
No, it came out to an even twenty.
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Well, it just seems that...
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
Noo!
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
What?
Two fours.
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
Sure I would!
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Borrow money from me?
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
I had a donut.
Hi!
That guy's going home with a note!
No. No, that's- that's okay.
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Could you speak up please?
You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Hey! I got great news!
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
Hey!
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
What equity investments?
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Okay to come in?
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
What?!
I'm the ruptured spleen.
'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Wow!
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Why did you look at me when you said that?
Guys, we bought the tickets.
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Well, I guess now we can't go.
What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
No, the quiet down thing!
You mean this.
Hell is filled with people like you.
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
Brrrrrrr!
He's back! The peeper's back!
Get down!
But you found the keys to his clothes?
And thank you for your time.
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
What is up?
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Could I be more sorry.
I wish I had smoked for my career...
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
That's so gross!
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
No, our guy is just a floating head.
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
Have you seen your guy's body?
Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
You're not supposed to look!
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Oh! Okay! Phew!
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
...Quality, right, great.
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
You guys.
Is this a service you're providing me?
That's still in there?!
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
Ahh!
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
We don't know what could make this go away.
All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
Oh no-no-no-no!
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
And no one touches the air around the TV!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
We could climb Mt. Everest!
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
And is this in case the house sneezes?
Not one that can pee on the roof.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
I don't want a ghost.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Yes, but for the last time.
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Joey, no means no!
Hey!
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon .
Get away from me I said no!
Because you're the only one that can be fair.
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Why do I have to decide?
Yeah.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
Why?!
I don't know!
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
No they didn't!
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
Yes?
How did you--?
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
What did you do when they found out?
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
Ginger.
Don't you have to use the bathroom?
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
We should always always break up together.
How do you do that?
It's like a gift.
Oh, I'd like that.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
No?
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
Yeah, sure.
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
Do not speak ill of the dead.
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
I might've said that. Why is that funny?
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Did you break up with her?
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Uhhhaahh.
Pecan sandy, just made em.
Uh, sure, why not.
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Okay. I love you so much.
What about your breath?!
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
Here you go. You can wear this.
Thanks!
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Nice try.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
Pffhah.
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
I think I need a drink.
Yeah!
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
Here we go! Here we go!
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Well, I'm very glad you're here.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
Mm-mmm.
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Was it like a sneeze only better?
Hey.
Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
What was it?
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
Huh?!
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking.
Chandler.
She's not here and please come in.
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
I came over here to tell you guys.
I gotta go.
Okay.
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Yeah
You think we're ready for something like that?
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
I think that's gum.
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
How long you been waitin' to say that?
Oh yeah.
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.
Okay.
I do. I do. I do.
Really?
Hello Joey.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Oh, that is so sick.
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
What is it?
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
What? What? What? What is it?
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
No-no, she really is sick!
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
Yeah.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
Are you sure this time?
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
Ohhh, man!!
What is that?
What in the name of hell?
Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
They make you take an oath?
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
You put your fist through the wall?
Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
You have to go to London!
Give him money? It was a joke!
Is this because of the burrito thing?
You need to give him money.
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
Yeah, I guess.
Hey guys.
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
It's my joke.
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
If you're planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and...
Nope.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
This almost never happens!
Now she's passed.
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
And I'm cute too.
And you're cute too.
Okay.
Bye.
Who jumps at loud noises!
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
Wow! I could've died tonight.
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Bye hon.
Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed...
Yeah.
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
They won't take you to the vet.
Chandler.
Joey.
It may not be a bed of roses.
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
Joe?
Yeah!
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
When'd you meet her?
Two days ago.
Oh yeah?
Hey.
I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
I know.
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
My Giant? I love that movie!
You really think this is okay?
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
I think maybe, yeah.
He loves you.
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Okay.
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
I do not hate Ross!
...And then he burst into flames.
Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
What are you doing here?
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Who? Is that your sister?
What does it look like? I'm going home.
See you later Mon.
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
No. No, thank you!
Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
Well, I do.
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
What are you guys doing?
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
What are you doing?
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
Did you hear that?
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Yeah!
Hey!
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
I know. I hate that!
Dude!
She's gone.
What?
And that's the only colour that comes in.
Oh, hi Chloe.
I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Oh!
You got waaaay too much free time.
Thanks.
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
Happy birthday, pal!
Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Hey what are you guys looking at?
Yeah, come to papa.
I know!
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
What?
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Oh, howd she take it?
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Well...
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
It's not a real game! I made it up!
Exactly.
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
At a fake game!!
To the left, to the left- aww!
Green. To the green.
I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
Ohhh... I'm fine.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
What?
What?
This was your idea?
What were you thinking?
You can be the best man when I get married.
Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
I'll never get to be a best man!
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
What?
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Excuse me?
Well, I just...
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
Yeah?
Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
Fat?!
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
It is starting to get dark out there.
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
I'm crying here!!
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Yeah?
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Would you give me one minute!! Please.
There are naked ladies there too.
Yeah.
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
I love you.
Hi Pheebs.
Hi!
Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
What?
Nuh-uh! They're maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. See, these names are good, and these names are bad. Ohh.
Hey!
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
What are you doing?
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
Oh, this is soo bad.
Joey!!!
What's goin' on?
You're it! Now run and hide!
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
You kissed him?!
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Thanks Chandler.
Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Why not?!
I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
Hey.
Hey! Any good mail?
And you're our age. You're our age.
Oh-oh, okay, okay! If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. You have a pleasant evening.
So, you're like a zillionaire?
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
What like Pete Dakota?
OK. Brake left, gas right?
OK.
Alright, here, you have to hold this.
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
Where's my seat belt?
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Fifteen minutes.
Okay.
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Noo! Nothing!
I think you're right.
All right, ready?
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
So you might say, it's a magic ring.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Okay!
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
It went under the table.
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
That's fine!
I know.
Mon?
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
Too bad, she's leaving.
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
It's not Rick.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Yeah, any messages for room 226?
You okay there, slugger?
If it helps, I could slide over.
No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Where are you going?
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Come on, it's fun!
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Yeah!
Okay. My word! Those are snug.
You're building a post office?
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
Much sense?!
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Alright, somebody.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Need a new table.
You think?
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
I said name one!
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Oh come on you big faker!
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Okay, if you really wanna have sex...
Okay!
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!
A couple of days.
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's...
Beefsteak Charlie's?
Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Nah, I got it.
Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!
Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
Hi Joey's sisters!
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Only here.
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Okay!
They have that on the napkins at the club.
Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
You have no trouble telling time now right?
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
No!
Quick! What time is it?!
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
You still can't stand her can you?
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Well, I guess that's something.
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Good. What made you change your mind?
How did that happen?!!
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
Yeah, I think it is!
So what did you do today?
Oh, it looks great!
...and then it got canceled.
Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
Ok.
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
Ah, there we go.
I think we proved our point.
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
Yeah.
And she's not crazy?
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
I sort've already asked Chandler.
What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
I am proud of all my friends today.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Were you're parents happy, or something?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
I know! I can't wait!
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
It took two people to break up this relationship!!
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Why haven't you told them?!
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
Ding!
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
No, we are. I'm sad.
Okay.
No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?
Oh, ooh.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
You're turning into a women.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
But, I put some honey in it.
She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
But I think we should tell her.
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
I wasn't escaping.
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
You look good.
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Really?
Oh, do you not want to?
Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Hey, the fight's starting!
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
What?
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
No.
Seriously?
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Uh, uh.
Well?
Hey.
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
I've got five bucks says you can't.
Umm?
I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
Get out your checkbook, mister.
Oh, I think I have the cash.
Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
People can hear you.
I know!!
Yeah.
Hi!
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Hello.
Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
That's what it sounded like.
All right...
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Come on! Chandler!
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Your company has a fine foods division?
Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
No! No, the robots just work for them.
So, how many have you sold so far?
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Oh God!
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Oh my God, how did you do that?
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Okay! Okay! Okay!
N-No running in the chapel!
Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!
So, what do you thing the good news is?
I love you, love you.
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
Oh my.
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
I told you I should not wear this color.
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
That's right.
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
Can I give you a present now?
Okay!
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
...The second guy.
Well, call me if you change your mind.
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Hey!
Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
Ow!
How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Yes!
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
Hey.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Not me.
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Oh, good for you!
Congratulations!
OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do...
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
Does it matter?!
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Yes!
So I really never get to win anymore?
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Fine! Get out!
Get out!!
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
That's it?
Yeah, it was really hard.
Ok, you weren't there.
Comin' through. Move, move.
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! You wanna go shotgun?
Yeah, losers talk!
No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
Yeah!
Hike!
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
Sure, do whatever you want.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
That-that's bad?
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Oo, toes!! Well, for some people.
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
First of the month.
And that's every month?
Ahhh.
Okay, here is the phone bill.
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Hey!
Hey!
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
What?
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Well, they're not mine!
Yeah, they're mine.
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Oh. Uh, I'm on.
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
What?
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Hey!
All right, here's the ring.
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
I say push her down the stairs.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
Nooo.
Oh. What do you do?
Yeah, I actually don't know...
Good, so do I
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
What are you talking about?
That's not possible!
Ow!
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
Good one.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Hey, guys!
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
How could it not matter?!
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
Hey, Lizzie.
Hey, Weird Girl.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Ow!
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
Why? Why can't you go to him?
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Yeah, okay. Alright.
Woooo! Yeah!
Phoebe, you're on.
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
Hey guys!
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
No, look.
That's a pig.
All right, then massage me up right nice!
It's your timer.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
It's so good, isn't it?
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Really?
Of course!
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
Come on, tell me.
You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
Congratulations.
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Oh damn, I hate that.
Oh, don't worry about it.
No, really you're gonna freeze.
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Oh, fine! Take his side!
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Arghh!!
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
We will give you $10.
Are you interested in this ring?!
Okay, I can let it go at eight.
We stand firm at $10.
That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
What just happened?
I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.
No.
No?
Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
Do you have any tissues?
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Why? What happened to him?
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
Oooh that may be a New World's record
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
What? That's impossible.
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
Monica! Chandler!
Hey, it's good to see you!
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
Hey!
Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
It's 4:30.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
What's going on?
He's retiling my floor.
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
He started mine first!
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Hey!
How ya doin'?
Pretty much, yeah.
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
You're not supposed to look!
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
I know.
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
He finally asked you out?
Yes!
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
So, I guess this is over.
What?
Why, exactly?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
Nooo!!
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Open it up, let me see.
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
Ooh, God it looks bad.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
Really?
Yeah!
Of course!
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Okay.
So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Yes!
I know!
All right, let's show them how it's done.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Yeah.
Okay.
Ow!
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Fine by me; hope she wins.
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
Hey!
Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
Morning.
Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
It came up.
Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Thank you.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Ok, that's enough.
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
All right!
How did you know?
In the park?
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Then free as a bird. What's up?
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
No, why?
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
What?
Eeaagh!
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Your fly is open, Geller.
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Yeah. Um... I'm out.
Can I check out what she did to my room?
So, is Janine around?
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
Okay.
And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Nina.
Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
Bodington's!
Bodington's! Woohoo!
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
Hey!
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
Beam me up Jesus.
No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
Oh!
Please!
Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
Come on, seriously.
Ross they're really, really, really white.
Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
How much longer?
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Ohh!
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
Crap.
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
High-five, the babies are coming!
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Its Phoebe! Hi!
Hi. Okay, will that be all?
Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now Im here.
No, no... how come you are working here?
You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
What?!
I'm Marjorie.
Hi.
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
Hi.
I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
We have got to wash that!
Yeah!
You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Whoa. That was really good.
Thanks, any suggestions?
Well, I-I might've said supergay.
You totally screwed him over.
Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
Hey!
Janice.
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
Hello.
And who is this little cutie pie?
You wanna smell him?
I assume we're talking about the baby now.
Course there, they just call it food.
Forget about her.
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
Ready?
My folks.
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
Easy.
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
What are you talking about? Keep it!
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Your sister Joan is crazy.
Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Come on Ben.
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Santa!
Hey!
Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place.
Yeah, coffeehouse.
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
How rude.
Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
I thought you meant in life.
Break.
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
Nooo!
Yeah, okay.
Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
Hey.
So uh, what are you guys doing?
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
Again I must go back to, how?
How?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Oh, well great.
Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
That's right my friend. It's time for...
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
No he, he moved out and I moved in.
I know I would.
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Where the hell have you been?!
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
What?!
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
Alright, well, be good, I love you.
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
Then be supportive like a guy.
Hi.
Hi!
Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
Ross, what're you doing.
I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?
To get my coat.
No no no.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Gooood morning!!
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Open up! Open up! Open up!
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
I KNOW!!!
We'll discuss it, in the morning!
What the hell is going on?!
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
A couple of days.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
I know.
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
Yeah.
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Which is bad, because?
Your... excuse me?
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Okay.
Okay, here we go. Ready?
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Yeah, I can do that.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Hmm.
OH...MY...GAWD!!
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
Yeah, I'm good.
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
Robert's coming out.
What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
What?!
The man is showing brain.
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
Well....
Goodnight.
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
No!
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Then all your stuff would be here.
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
Here, look, alright, does this help?
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.

Alright!
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
I'm so sorry!
Sorry!
She sent the chicken back again?!
She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
At least as long as I have the pants.
I know!
How long do you want the cuffs?
I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
How is she?
Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Yeah, why not. So I told her.
Yeah? How'd it go?
Well, howdya feel?
Pretty good! I told her.
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Morning.
Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
Good morning.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Monica's wasted.
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Yep.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Yeah, right.
I'm good.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Maybe she never got your message.
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Then all your stuff would be here.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
Chandler, why are you doing this?
Chandler.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?
What's it about?
Lifeguards.
Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Wow! Look at them run.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Okay, you're on.
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Monica!
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Okay!
Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Yeah.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Might wanna try Joseph.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Can I help you?
Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
What?
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
You're so bad!
I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
Yeah, so?
And now I've picked it up again.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
I did pay for half of it.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
Oh.
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Okay.
Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Nina.
Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
I can't believe that didn't work!
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Hey!
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Me.
Why would I have to sleep with you?
Hey.
Morning.
Ok so, can I have my hat back?
We're ok.
Alright.
No.
Huh.
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Seven hundred bucks!
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
What? He's cute!
Is Brian...?
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
What?!
Unagi. I'm always aware.
What's up?
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
OK, Phoebs. But what about you?
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...
Yes. Vividly.
She was kidding about that right?
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
Remembered what?
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
I'll have whatever Christine is having.
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Oh my God.
You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
What?
Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
All right!! Fine! Fine.
Arrrghh!!
You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
But we have to!
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too.
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
No.
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
I can't believe it! We're here!
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Come here. Okay, be right back.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Well, where's the logic in that?!
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
That's right!
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
Great, you can cover Chandler.
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
How might you be wrong?
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
That's no problem.
What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Yeah right.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
You cook naked?
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
What's the matter?
Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Yes, include more people in this.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
What'd you rent?
Die Hard 2.
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Joey, we just saw it!
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
I'm sorry, who's this?
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
No, there's no dog here?
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
People do stupid things when they're upset.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
Hi!
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Thank you so much.
How hot is this?!
Yeah, me too.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Like?
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh...
Big dog?
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
You gotta take the canoe!
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Yeah, why not?
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
You are a frightening, frightening man.
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
It's not that bad.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
How many beeps?
She answered.
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
Forget about it.
How you doin there squirmy?
So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
I have nothing to do with casting.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Oh umm, not go.
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Come on!
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
We're switching rooms.
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
So, Spock actually hugs his father?
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
Hey, do you guys have... ...hi.
Hi.
Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
What check thing?
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
That's Bill Clinton.
Who's he huggin'?
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
It's a beautiful thing.
What's this?
Which goes where?
I have no idea.
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Oh Joey!
That's right!
Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!
Oh no!
So there is no good time to ask that question.
Have you ever been with a woman?
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
How much did I love The King and I?
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Chandler!
Me too! Me too! Me too!
Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
What's going on?
I slept with Monica.
Oh no!
You slept with my sister?
I'm still on London time, does that count?
Okay.
Bye.
That counts!
Oh, good!
Tell me it's "you and me" we.
Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Uh, we might be leaving now.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Ok, you can not do this to me.
: What do you need, what do you need?
: Joey, I'm a little shy.
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
Fifteen.
Alright, here's ten.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Can I get you something from the bar?
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
What the hell are doing?!!
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Dude! He's right there!
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Noooo.
Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.
Hello.
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Noo!! Okay!!
Okay!
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Here, here!
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
Oooh!
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
You could?
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
Sure! Okay, you go first.
Okay, come here! Come here.
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Well I'm sorry.
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
Do you realize you get louder each week?
Diane Keeton.
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
You don't like ice cream?
It's too cold.
It hurts my teeth.
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
I love that idea!
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Aww.
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
You have done enough!
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Oop, your cake is ready!
Oop!
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
Hey!
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
I love you!
Bonjour, monsieur.
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
You kissed her.
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
I came over here to tell you guys.
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Come on.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Thanks, man, big help.
I wasn't- I mean, I-
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
They're gonna call her Chandler.
Works on you.
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
Is this a service you're providing me?
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Uh-huh.
So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Thank you. Uh...
Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
I don't want you taking that thing.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Really?
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
You got married again.
Yes.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Wow! If only more people knew.
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Oh.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Joey, speed it up!
I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Why?
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...
Wow! That is a bad audition.
Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
Right this is staging.
And the moment of joy is upon us.
The bll is drrbing!
In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Stick a fork what?
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
NO!!!
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Hey, Lowell.
Hey, Chandler.
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Hi.
Hey!
Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
What?!
Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
I'm the ruptured spleen.
Why would you do that?
Really?
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
What?!
Are you serious?
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Really?!
That's-that's not Phase Three.
Well, I'm there too!
Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Here you go.
Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Yeah, she's...
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
... And where's this money coming from?
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
What kind of research?
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
I tried! They won't take her back.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Hey!
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Ross, we can handle this.
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Oh, do you not want to?
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
She's bluffing!
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Your tax dollars?
Yeah, okay.
Did I say you could smell it?!
I can't smell your sandwich?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
That guy, he burns me up.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
...Dinah?
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Baywatch!!
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Okay.
...says $30 Father; same as in town.
Really?
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
There's an image.
Would anybody like more coffee?
I'm just serving it.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
No.
Ready?
Yeah.
Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
And?
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Actually, I did!
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Are you serious?
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
You think?
Hi, honey.
What? Why, why would...
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
No no no.
Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Call it even?
Okay.
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
She's not Rachel.
Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
Put it on.
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
Phoe-be!!
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
Do you know why?
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
My scones.
'My scones.'
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Did not.
Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
Fan out! Fan out!
Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this.
OH YES!!!!!
Strip Happy Days Game?
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
It was, it was her voice.
Hola! Hello. Hello?
Okay. That was her right?
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
Weren't you nine?!
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Him? Him, Ross?
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Well, I, umm...
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
You're dying?!
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
Okay, that's enough honey!
Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
What's you point man?
Hey.
Hey.
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Or! You can just, y'know...
What the hell are you doing?
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
You tired Chandler?
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
So?
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Oh my!!
Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Hi!
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
Bye.
She's dating. She's dating.
What do you mean?
Do you not see it?
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Sure!
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Hey, opposite, is opposite!
He's got nothing!
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Oh and you know what I want!
I do not have baby fever!
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Thank you!
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Oh uh, when?
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
Oh.
Hey!
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
I'm not moving out.
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Aw, I know all about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
I'm not finished.
Oh.
Hey!
Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Oh, well I'm uh...
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
With a K.
Oh-oh-hey!
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Who?
Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.
No, forget it.
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
Yeah.
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
Okay.
Did I, uh, did I miss something?
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Actually, uh, we're both the father.
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Ok.
Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
Well, hello!
Hey.
Help yourself.
You okay?
We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Is he alright?
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
So, you feel like a dad yet?
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
It's him, not it!
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
You think?!
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
No, wait Phoebe.
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Okay.
Yeah?
It's nice.
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
Sure I would!
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Can you hear that?
Yeah?
Oh. Uh, I'm on.
Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
That's right!
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Now get on out of here, you!
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
Oh, I can't watch this.
Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
I gotta get one, too.
What are you guys doing?
Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Hm-hmm.
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
Hey! Hi!
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
Okay... ..whose turn is it?
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Of course! It's her favorite.
More of Grandma's teramisu.
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Are you alright?
My God, you're choking! That better?
Perfection?

Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Who gave you that hickey?
That would be the work of a Blowfish.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
How did you know about that?!
Were you the ones called the cops?!
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Well, yeah actually.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
That's me! Come on!
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
Hi Chandler.
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
So.... I quit.
Why?
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
Hey pal.
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Okay.
Okay.
Hmph.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
But my clothes are-ohh!
Wow, you look...
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
That's-that's my nubbin.
What's a nubbin?
You have three nipples?
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
Batman has the Batmobile!
007 gets all the ladies.
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
Actually, I don't like martinis.
We came over as soon as we saw.
Hey.
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
How could you not tell us?
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Hi, honey! I'm home!
Don't come in here!
No! We only mess around at his place!
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Fine with me.
Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
Which do I like?
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
Then don't leave me!
What?
No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
Oh? Hello you.
Eh?
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
Yeah.
It's a pretty cool tux.
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Look, it was a job all right?
I will not take this abuse.
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Hey sweetie.
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Let's never speak of this.
You got it.
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.
Why?
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Alright open your eyes.
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
Congratulations!
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Okay, fine, $300.
300 dollars?!
Urghh!!
What are you guys woofing about?
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
Nice shoes, huh?
Aah, y'killing me!
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
Monica.
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
What?!
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
Ahhhh!
You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
Okay, well g'night.
Good night.
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
And wait, I've got something for you.
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
The one time they're not home.
OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
She's comin'.
It's me.
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
Why would he turn off the TV?
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Yes he did.
Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?
What?!
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
Let me try it on!
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Okay.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
What, like there's a rule or something?
It's, uh, it's Paul.
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
A little what?
Hello Tilly.
Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.
Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Oh, Chantal!
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh...
Really?!
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Joe?
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
Yeah!! I call that London style.
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
What happened?
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
I'm not getting into this again!
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
No!
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
Yes, of course they like you!
Well Monica just told me that they don't.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Really? Okay, so...
Know when to stop.
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Right!
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Oh-ho, and mine!
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
Yeah, I don't know.
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Oh, good.
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
Hello.
It's Erica.
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
I am so sorry.
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
Hi.
Hi.
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
We're hanging out.
What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
I'm sorry honey.
Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
So, should I call him back?
Noo! NO!
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
Yeah.
Alright.
Oh good.
Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother.
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
Oh yes! Oh yes!
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
What do we use to split it?
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
Well, I think we all learned something.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
Y'know what that means?
That you're actually 50?
But those are the words! Those exact words!
I'd love it if you would do it.
Hey!
Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
Hey!
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Good idea! Yes!
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
You ready?
Yeah.
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Let me see the earrings.
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
You sure?
Uh-huh!
Thanks daddy.
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Buddy?
My fish, Buddy.
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
Bad dream?
I wasn't sleeping.
The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
So, did you pick one yet?
Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Hello, Janice.
What are you doing here?
Are you being British?!
No. Not anymore.
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Are you naked in there?
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
No, no, this is the first time.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
I'm fine, thanks.
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Okay.
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Come here, I want to show you something!
Okay!
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
It must take you forever to find your keys.
Hmm? Oh, yeah.
Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Aah!
Hey!
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Oh yeah? That's great!
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
He's kind of intense huh?
A little what?
Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Well, so what does he do?
Your company has a fine foods division?
It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
Really?
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
Drums?
No! Drums!
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
Ahoy!
Hey! How's the boat?!
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
I can do that for the kids.
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
Okay. Have a benefit.
Hey!
Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
Absolutely, yeah!
Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
No you know I don't mind.
I know.
I know.
Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
I'm just serving it.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Ahh, miss? More coffee?
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Your sister Ursula.
Oh, really.
Rifts. Yeah, I know.
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
Ohh! You made up!
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Ohh, get a room.
We have one.
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
No, just give me another minute.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
People are trying to sleep in here!
Open it up, let me see.
Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Really, y'think so? I don't..
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Joey!
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
Are you naked in there?
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
You were gonna propose?
No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
I know.
You gave my father a lap dance!
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!
C'MON!
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
Hey.
Hey.
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
That's what you should say.
What?
Really? I can do it?
I'd love it if you would do it.
I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
It's Ross.
All right.
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
You know, I think I might just.
Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
Mon?
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Great!
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
I love you.
Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Okay.
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
And also, my birthday.
To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
Oh yeah.
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
We never get smacked.
Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
Is all this true?
Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Did not.
Okay, I freaked out a little.
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Ross, how could you let this happen?
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
What?
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Some girl ate Monica.
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Oh, you look so great.
Ahh, so do you, beautiful.
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Yeah, you wish.
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
The one that doesn't.
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Okay.
Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Aqui est.
A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
Mira, Mira, el viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop!
Ewww!
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
As crazy as soccer?
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Okay!
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
What?
Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Yes, but you are dead inside.
All right well, I'd better take that back.
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
Think it'll work?
You can not do this.
Do what, do what?
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Ohhh! Put it out!
Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
Hey!
What's wrong Mon?
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Our baby.
We have a baby?
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Then...who did?
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
Thanks.
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Okay!
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
It went under the table.
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
Joey was in a porno movie.
Huuh.
You were in a porno?
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up either!
Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
What do I do now?
Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
Okay.
Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
You mean like a doctor?
Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
Ha!
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
We're not alone.
Is that the fire alarm?
Cool.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
You got a problem with that?
Hey, how'd the interview go?
It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Hmm.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
How?
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Really?!
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it.
The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
I got it.
Go! Go! Go!
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
Oh, my, god.
Janice? You called Janice?
You remember Janice, right?
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
What are you saying I should do?
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
Because I'm cooler.
No, seriously.
Hey you guys! What's happening?
Oh my God!
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
Oh.
Well, I'm from California.
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
Oh, I embarrass you?
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Yeah, I think she looks good.
Ohh, thank you.
Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
Total wuss!
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
What do you got there?
Condoms, dude!
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Again I must go back to, how?
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
What 'cha doing?
Oh!!
No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Santa? Really?
Yes, is that okay?
No.
Then it's okay!
And no one touches the air around the TV!
We don't know what could make this go away.
Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
But, we'll stay here with you.
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Marcel?
Marcel?!
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
No way!
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Got me.
Can I get a beer.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Or 45.
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Well, it's getting late.
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
Hey!
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
Yes.
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
You want it?
Oh no.
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Hey, I've been married 3 times
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Chandler!
You work with robots!!
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
My friend's name is Joey.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Hey!
Hey!
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Yeah, baby!
What are you doing?
No thanks. I'm 29.
Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
Oooh that may be a New World's record
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
Done! With time a-to-spare.
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Yes.
Guys, you got your hair cut.
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
Oh, okay.
Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
You mean there's more than one of us.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Hey!
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
What?
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Well, you-you know what I meant.
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
Yes!!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
So, you busy Thursday?
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Hey! Hi!
Hi!
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
You bought a boat?
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
Of course, yeah!
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Okay, come here! Come here.
Okay!
Okay.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Can I help you?
Or not, whatever.
This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
All right, what's going on there?
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Of course!
Ross didn't scare you?
Come here, I want to show you something!
Okay!
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
Of course not.
No.
Hey, hey Rach!
Oh, hi!
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Fight's over!
Bing! You got those numbers for me?
No, I ah, I didn't do them.
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
Is something wrong?
Okay.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
Here you go.
At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
Chandler!!
Okay. Oh, no!
What, what's it, what's going on?
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
It's so good, isn't it?
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Good-bye muscles!!
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
Oh, here's a great one.
Yeah, I'm not in that.
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too.
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
But we have to!
Well then, you should look with us.
Why?
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
Okay. All right.
Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
What happened?
She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
I think it's winning.
I think it's insane.
Think it'll work?
No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
I don't think mine likes me either.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
A wandering?
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
What?
What?!
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Yeah baby! No baby!
Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Aww, honey I'm sorry.
God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Yeah?
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
Hi Monica.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
Ohhh, yeah!
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Hey guys!
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Yeah!
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Makes me wanna puke!
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
Oh man, this is hilarious.
Chandler!!
Okay, what do you guys think?
Dude!
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
All right!
What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything...
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
Hi. She said yes.
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
Yeah.
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
No! I did!
Of course! It's her favorite.
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
Well, I have a call in about that.
Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
How little?!
A couple of hours, I feel awful.
I can't!!
Why not?!
All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
What, he doesn't like Josh?
No, I don't.
Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
Yeah?
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
I never stop thinking about it.
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Why not?
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Hey!
Hey!
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Ohh!
Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
What can we do for you?
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
That's right!
Yeah! We are!
We're the Cobras!
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Come in!
Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
So is Joey around?
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
That's one?
It's kind of an important one!
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
I know, this is a great apartment.
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Hey.
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Why?!
On account of my rage.
He gave me a pill for it.
A pill?
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
No, I'm not!
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Not really.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.
All right.
What are you doing?
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Look at this!
Oh! You have a window!
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Two.
Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Put it back exactly where you found it?
'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
She's bluffing!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Hi!
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
What gay thing?
Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
Hi.
Hey!
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
What are you reading?
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Honey that sounds like fun.
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
Really?
Ehh.
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
What?!! What?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Who cares? I repel women.
What?!
What?!
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
Yeah?
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Aww, I love you so...
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Hey!
Hey!
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Your make-up!
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
Oh.
No, I really did forget my purse.
Horrible!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
So the going for help went well?
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
Then why are you smoking?
Well it's very unsettling.
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
You're welcome.
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
Yeah, I got that.
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
Yeah, she was my best teacher.
Ohhh.
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Do you mind telling us what it is?
Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Hey!
Hey!
Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Yeah.
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
Hey Chandler.
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Yes. Yes. Just here and there .
Yeah, swing music is so out.
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
How might you be wrong?
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
How do you know?!
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Get out!
What took you so long?
Oh, good.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
No.
Noooo!!
Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Yeah, I know but...
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
Like, when you're cooking a steak.
Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
What?!
Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
Oh, I see.
They break your heart, don't they?
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Okay. What was tonight?
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
Amazingly, that makes sense.
Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
I can't believe he didn't come!
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Well, we could do that!
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Really?!
A four and a nine.
You're kidding right?
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Well, that went well.
I think so.
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?
Ok, that's so nice.
Hey, Mom? Having fun?
Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
Okay.
Well, that went well. Yeah.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Chandler?
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I...
Hello.
Stop callin'!!
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
Thank you!
Joey's a sex addict.
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Oh, great!
No.
All right. Very good.
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
It's not my first time.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Of course.
Oh, you're-you're going?
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
What? What? Why?!
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
Fumble!
What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
One second.
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
No, I'm-I'm serious!
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
I did not!
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Hey! How'd the interview go?
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
Rachel has a new doll.
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Why?
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
Who needs a lease when it's family!
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Hey.
Hey! Any good mail?
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
"Benefits lapsed."
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
Man you are incredible.
Well, we had a table in college.
Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Can I use your phone?
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Maybe she never got your message.
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
What did you do on yours?
I went to Egypt with my dad.
Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" All right? I mean she's taken my class!
And slept with the professor.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
I am so attracted to him right now.
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
Well, Joey's my best friend.
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
Uh, yes, yes it is.
Chandler Bing?
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
Hey.
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
It's your birthday!
Hey.
Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
They do!
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
Hey-hey, what's going on?
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Thanks.
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Why don't you just call her?
Do you?
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Hhhiiii.
What's the matter with you?
Noo.
You're kiddin'.
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
What's the matter with Rog?
Yeah.
What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Bye.
Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
It is???
No.
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
How ya feelin'?
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Yeah.
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Right, I'll see you guys later...
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah...
Why don't you just take it with you?
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Yeah.
Woooo hoooo!!!
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
What if they don't?
You think I need a new walk?
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
Hey!
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
What?!
What's wrong with you?
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
Of course not.
No.
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
All right.
A two and a five.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
Eight! Easy eight.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
Sophie sit!!
No! God, would you just calm down!
Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
I warned you...
Who is being loud?
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
What?
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
'Kay.
Looks good.
Hey dude, it's me.
Hey it's Joey!
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
Long!
I can't believe you let them win!
I was frustrated.
It was my racquet.
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
We have to assign heads to something.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
Hey.
Oh, hi.
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
I like her.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Look at you. All jealous.
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Op, I like credit cards!
Well, so what does he do?
Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
Thanks.
Yeah.
Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Bye!
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Actually, I did!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Oh my god.
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
Oh, honey.
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Oh yeah! I know.
Can you hear anything?
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
Man, I am so beat.
Oh yeah.
Yeah alright.
Hey you're in our seats.
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Pick a number! That is your only job!
8. 8!
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
You mean like for award shows?
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Hey.
Hey!
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Instead of...?
That's right.
All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Come on. I'll let you lead.
Ok.
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
Well, Mon, I was married.
Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?
May I help you?
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.
I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.
Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Noo!
Chandler!!
Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
That was a half an hour?
It's your timer.
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
To Monica!
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
So will I.
Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Just do it.
Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
What does it look like? I'm going home.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Not any more.
Really?!
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Hey! How's it goin'?
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Could you want her more?
Who?
Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!
Hi! How are you?
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
I was shrieking... like a Marine.
I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
Don't do it!
Don't do what?
What?
Are you crazy?
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
I did not!
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
I wish I had smoked for my career...
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
It's not like we don't know how to party!!
Yeah! All right? Let's go!
Yeah!!!
All right!!
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
All right, what about the third guy?
Can you blame him?
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
I see where you're goin'!
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
That saves us a conversation.
Me too, we should get goin'.
No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
What?
The sheep.
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Hey!
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
Yeah.
He hates to lose.
You're not a lefty?
Does anybody know me?!
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Yeah.
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Really?
No.
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
Huh?
You didn't even take off your pants.
Yeah, well, lucky for you.
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
Oh, no thanks.
Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
I know, Monica told me.
Yeah. Sure.
Can you people not see me?!
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
Love....
No you know I don't mind.
Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Those two only had each other!
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
You mean the spitter?
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
All right, what about the third guy?
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Okay!
Wow! You are really fast!
We're gonna see each other naked.
Yep!
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Yeah?
What's up?
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay.
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Why haven't you told them?!
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you.
Hey you guys!
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
Kiss me!
Oh, Chandler, sorry.
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
Hey guys! What's...
Ahhh.
Yeah, right.
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
Damnit!! Did you move?!
Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Let me try it on!
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
What?
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
Well, let me see.
Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing.
Joey, some people don't like that.
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
Is that a problem?
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Still doing the screening thing?
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
That's a good one!
Hey, Joe.
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Are you mocking me?
Hey, what's up?
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
Hey.
Come on!!
I just got off the phone with my sister.
Ah, which, which one?
There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
No, women are welcome to play.
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Oh, yeah, right.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Oh my good God.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Oh, the mixed tape.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
No, answer his.
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
Fifty-six!
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
How come we have one extra place setting?
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
I'm gonna try.
You're welcome.
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Okay. Will you marry me?
Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?
8,600.
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Where do you work?
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
Why?
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
You're driving me crazy with that!
Okay, I'll stop.
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
No!!
So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Uh, yeah.
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
Well, I'm from California.
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
I'll have coffee.
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Really? I've heard better.
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
You're a little high maintenance.
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
I have no name.
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.
Oh, I think I have the cash.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Hmm.
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Hey guys.
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
What?
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Did you call the cops?
Nope. We took her to lunch.
What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
OK.
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Last time I do that, I promise.
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
What? What? What?!
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
Oh!... Right!
Hey Rach!
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
What?
All yours babe.
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
I bet he can.
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Ohh! My God! Barry!!
You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
Oh, we could do this all day.
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
You hug me!
All right!
Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
Okay, there.
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
And there you go!
Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
Wherever! I've got like 20!
So, will I like any of these guys?
Chandler!
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Okay.
Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's...
Relaxi-Taxi!
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Foot rubs for a month!
Freedom!
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
What was that?
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Hi! Hey!
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
But you're still my friend?
Not for the next few minutes.
Nope.
Do I still call you Ross?
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Wow.
So Joey, you okay?
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
Ohh!!
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
Tell it again. Seriously.
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
Right this is staging.
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
Whose is it?
I don't want to say.
Diane Keeton.
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
That is so sweet!
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Okay, you guys free tonight?
Yeah!!
Hey!
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Can you really do that?
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
Who cares? He works in a museum!
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
Thanks.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
You knew about this?
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Thanks, man, big help.
Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Phoebe's a porn star!
What?!!
Oh my God!
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
What is going on with you?
Nothing!
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
Gay!
That can't be your father.
What?
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
Well? Isn't that amazing?
What are we supposed to be seeing here?
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
Then don't do that, alright?
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
Where in Cuba?
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
What's the big deal?
Where are you going?
How about you guys?
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
Turns out he is kinda funny.
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
Woah.
Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?
Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
Oh man!!
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
I know.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
I'll never get to be a best man!
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Alright, well, be good, I love you.
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Really stupid.
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
You really didn't know?
Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
Like what?
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
You got ink on your lip.
Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh....
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Oh, well I'm uh...
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Yeah, you do!
Come on!
Good one.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
Were you're parents happy, or something?
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
Your cappucino sir.
Thank you.
Absolutely.
How come it's not mixing with the water?
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Crap.
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
Hey, hey, they're runnin'
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
All right then.
The game is over, we eat now?
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
Pheebs, I have to ask you...
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
She is so great! I miss her.
What does she mean by 'involved'?
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
So what are you gonna do?
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
Okay.
That's a duck.
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
No, forget it.
All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.
All right.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Awesome!
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
Thank you! Thank you!
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
What did, what did he say?
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
Pop it in.
I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
See, I told you they don't swim.
Wait. Give him a minute.
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Check this out. Can I have this?
How can you not believe in evolution?
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Really?
So-so you would've just lied?
Yes!!
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Okay.
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.
Are you OK?
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Rach, these are for you.
Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
What?!
Gunther, I quit.
....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
I spelled out boobies.
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
That's 'cause you have it.
That's a good point.
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
Yeah me too.
I know. Yeah.
No, we're alright.
So I got ya something.
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Umm, Gene.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
Ok, who ordered what?
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Oh god.
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Really?! Really?!
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Hey, Sophie!
Hey, Rach!
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Well, you're gonna.
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Well, I said it loud.
It is okay, if I stay and watch?
Well, that went well.
I think so.
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Uh, Ross.
What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Hey, that was really good!
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Oh, hey guys!
Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
Then get over yourself! Grow up!
You grow up.
No! I did!
Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Oh God.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
Where's your baby?
Ben! Ben! Ben!
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
Hey everyone!
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
Poor thing!
So that story doesn't make you cry?
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
Excuse me.
Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
No.
Hey!
Hey.
OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
What is with your nose?
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Oh.
Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
The country?
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
What am I sitting on?
Ew-eww!! Undies!
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
That's a duck.
Oh, it was, nah, well....
What thing? What thing?
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Ahh, miss? More coffee?
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Hey.
Hey.
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
What?!
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
No!
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Okay!
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
It's not that bad.
So, you're just Bing?
I have no name.
What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
Oh, my.
What?
Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
You're right!
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Congratulations.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
I-I know. Well if something comes up...
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Okay!
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Well, can I just...
Shh!! Wait, what?
Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
Ohh.
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
Who cares? He works in a museum!
Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
Guess who's back in show business.
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
Oh, no.
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
I hate when Ross is right!
He is right, isn't he?
You think?
Oh-no, he's right.
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
No, no, no, that's Dina.
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
...in you, my endless love. My endless love.
I've found.
I've found....
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Really?!
Do you wanna?
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Yes.
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Over here!
I almost caught that one!
Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
Wait, what am I gonna do?
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
Actually, me too.
Oh damn, I hate that.
Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
That's great.
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
That's it?
Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Oh my God.
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
In...in two weeks.
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
We?
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
Hello!
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Okay!
Uh-hmm.
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Kiss her! Kiss her!
I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
Well, there you go.
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Merry Christmas!!
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
So?
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Yeah! You?
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Yes, they can stay with us.
Well uh, do either of you smoke?
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
Hey Rach!
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
What's the big deal?
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
Hey.
Hey!
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
dammit!
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
Oh, sorry we didn't know.
Hey, we were sitting there.
Is that supposed to be funny?
No actually, I was just going for colorful.
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.
What?
I made that joke up.
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Oh, no-
Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Chandler what do you say?
Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh...
How about those three pointers?
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
I might've said that. Why is that funny?
Hi!
Hey!
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Over my dead body!
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
Oh my God, you look so good!
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.
Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
Where are you from?
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Do you know what just happened?
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
Monica?
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
What's an identical hand twin?
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
How?
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
And she's back in the game.
Hello Skidmark.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Nothing!
So what are you gonna do?
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
Do we need a cake?
Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Booo!!
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
Her answer machine?
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
How?
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Hi! How'd it go?
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
What?!
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Okay.
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Yeah, I understand.
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
Hi, it's me.
Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
What?
They were in his office.
I'm telling you man, I saw it.
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...
Hey!
What?
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Yeah!
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Doug!!
Hmm.
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
We're rehearsing a Greek play.
That's very funny. We done now?
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
Pretty nice?
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?
Sure.
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
That's why you broke up with me?
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
Really?! I won!
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Did not.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
It's not Rick.
No, it's-it's Andrew.
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
But I already gave them back to you!
No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
Sure, I-I-I...
Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
No. No. I don't think so.
Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
The cushions are the essence of the chair!
That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
I was tired!
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
God, Susan is so fun!
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
No, but I'm gonna!
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
Hey, that was really good!
Thanks! Let's keep going.
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
"Smoke away."
Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
You know, I think I was sixteen.
Please, just a little bit off the back.
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
How many?
Nine.
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Ross!
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Here's your scone.
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
That's not specific to girls.
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
What, uh... what juggling thing?
No.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
I'm not a nice guy.
Alright boys, let's eat.
You still on that?
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
So?
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
What've you been up to?
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
I know.
I'm back.
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Noooooooo!!
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
I couldn't do it.
You couldn't do it?!
What?! You're going out with her again!
Going out with who?
You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Theyre twins!
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
Yeah.
Lets not do that any more.
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Probably because...
You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
No, really you're gonna freeze.
No, I'm not.
Some day, maybe.
Funny book?
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
Ha!
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
What's going on?
My lighter's in there!
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
What?!
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
I got it! Scotch... tape.
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Aww, man!
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Yeah! Right!
WHAT IS IT?!
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .
Wow, he must like you the best.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
No problem. Hey Chandler
I think they get it.
Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Ahh!
What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
I wish all guys could be like him.
I know.
He doesn't have anyone.
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Waaay too special.
I am famished. What do I want...
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Shut up!! It just got interesting!
What did you just say?
Are you serious?!
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Hi!
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Okay.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
All right!
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
: That book got me through some tough times.
There is a little child inside this man!
Who's this from?
Oh, that's Ross's.
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
The second sister dies?!
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
That's correct.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Do we pay for this?
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
Hi. She said yes.
How do I look?
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
No, that's not exactly what I was..
So what do you want?
You.
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Yes, it was!
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Dude! Dude!
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
What?! Tonight?!
That's what Monica said.
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
Phoebe!
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
Hey!
You look great!
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
No. No!
So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh.
It was my first time.
With Carol? Oh.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
You don't like that show?
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
Oh o-, OK man.
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
Oh, what the hell is that?
It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
I got it! Here we go.
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Well that would help the pride thing.
Hey!
Okay.
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
So, that's it?
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
I think maybe, yeah.
He loves you.
Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
Huh?!
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Could we be more white trash?
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
In the park?
Just those two!
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
And she's supposed to buy this?!
Joey, bravo!
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
I am definitely gonna watch that!
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Huh, wanna bet?
How about we play for more money, say 150?
150 dollars.
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
It's like two miles!
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!


C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
And you never knew she was a lesbian...
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Dude! How come you took off?
Is something wrong?
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
They're all tourists.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems.
Hey, mind if I use the phone?
Oh, I...
Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Yeah, but you didn't.
Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
You, you are gonna love this.
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's "smelly cat, smel-ly cat".
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Hey!
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
That would be great.
Okay!
I know!
Bye!!!
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Really?!
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Which guy?
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
Come on.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
But Mon, you have to get our money!
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
Hey guys.
Hey.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
Oh.... my.... God.
Hey, it's Janice.
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
What's wrong with you?
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
That's a hernia.
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Yeah.
How many kids were we gonna have?
What else did you think about?
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
You guys don't think I look 19?
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
What's a Movement class?
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
I'm getting dressed.
Why?
Wait. I wanna show you something.
What is it?
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Well, the duck...
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Well that was umm...Okay.
It wasn't the best.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Well, the lighting was okay.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
Okay.
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
Oh please!
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
I don't know.
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
There are seven?!
Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.
Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
You have Knicks tickets?
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
No, no, this is the first time.
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Well, let me see.
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
What?!
So you were right?
Chandler!
Chandler, what did she say?
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
Are you serious?
Does Joey know?
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Yes. Yes!
One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
Good! That's good!
Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
How are you?
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
I-Ohh!
There you go! There you are!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Hey!
Hey!
No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Yeah!
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Okay.
All right.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Yeah.
So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
Oh, is he hungry already?
I guess so.
I gotta get one, too.
What are you guys doing?
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
I know. Thanks.
Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
Yeah.
Okay, for next time, what do you say?
I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
Well, I feel like a snack!
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
What?!
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Well then why can't I see it?
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Really?
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Where is this party?
Here in Chelsea.
Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
Umm, I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
Oh!
I am so jealous.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Not if I kiss you first.
Ooh.
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!
It'll be great for next weekend.
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Petrie.
Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
Ross?
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
No, did he hug you?!
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Hey Chandler?
Yeah?
All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Look, we are not gonna...
Dah!!
But if we win, we get your apartment.
No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Yeah, but don't you think....
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
It's Joey's birthday.
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Oh-oh-hey!
Wow! You are really good at this.
I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now.
Hey!
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Oh, you get used to it.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Oh.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Let us keep the apartment and...
As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh, I don't know.
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Oh.
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
So, let's go.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
Come on you guys, one more time.
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
It's raining men!
Amen!
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Who?
Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Monica, you don't know that.
Well, who's voice was that?
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Great, I'll see you then.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Do you always have to bring him here?
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Hi.
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Ah, yeah!
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
No, ten o'clock.
What?
Oh. Hel-lo!
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
That's too hard. Too hard!
All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Oh umm, not go.
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Thank you.
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Hey!
Hey.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Off to see young Ethan?
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Uh yeah, right here.
Thank you, Happy Holidays.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Okay.
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
No! That's-that's my arm!
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Okay!
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Joey! You didn't even know her!
Ah whatever!
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Well there you go.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
Weird world. Your kids?
Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me.
Heh, what d'ya say?
I don't know. It's a bracelet.
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
No I didn't!
You love me!
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
What am I sitting on?
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
That's right baby.
All right, let me in.
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
No! I balanced my checkbook.
I can't believe he didn't come!
So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
My God Monica!!
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
Ooh! So close.
Hey everybody!
No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
What? Nothing.
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
Well what is it? Let me see.
Hey, someone order a coat?
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
Hey!
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Yeah, that's what I said.
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
I can't believe this!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Rifts. Yeah, I know.
Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
Not from where I was standin.
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
Do I still call you Ross?
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
No problem.
So are we...friends again?
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Good luck, honey!
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Men are here.
We make fire. Cook meat.
Ewww!
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Oh.
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Chandler.
I will.
Do you want me to call?
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Horn-swoggle.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
Hi, Pheebs!
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
Gas? Wow! Intense.
Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
Yeah.
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Well, I like it. Here you go.
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Well, yeah actually.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
We are! Help us!
Help!
Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Hi honey, how did it go?
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
So what happened?
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
What?!
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
At least I care about his feelings!
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Sure!
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
And now you want that money back.
Exactly.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Come on, they were not that huge.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Hey!
I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
No, I'm alright, thanks.
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.
I'm Gail.
Chandler.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Nope.
Yep, yep...You?
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
Uh-huh.
Well no, but um.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
Ohh! I did not get that.
Yeah, it's good.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
Oh, really?
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Hey.
Hey.
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
It's Joey's birthday.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
You mean they like you.
Maybe.
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
That's very funny!
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Really?
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Whoa!
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
I call it!!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Hi, Julie!
No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
Hey.
Hey! So, did you quit?
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
And that's funny, why?
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
8. 8!
Thank you!
Yay!!
8!
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Uh-huh.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Eww!
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Nooo!
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
You did the right thing.
I don't like this anymore.
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
Why? What you'd do?
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
C'mon hurry, hurry.
Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.
OK.
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
What's the matter?
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
Really.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Tah-daaah!
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Needs some clothes altered?
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
You didn't find her?
No, I've looked everywhere!
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
That's great!
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Awwwww...
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Hey!
Hi Pheebs!
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
She will be after tonight.
Yeah.
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Hi.
Hello.
I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
A big idiot.
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
Hi.
Hi.
Yes?
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
I don't what your talking about.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
You will like it!
No I won't.
Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
Huh?
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
He is so amazing.
Oh, I know. Look at him.
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
That's great!
Excellent!
That is so good! Do it again!
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
There y'go, kids.
You seen Sandy?
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
Looks good, uh?
Yeah.
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Why? I love that thing.
Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.
Y-, y-, you like that show?
You don't like that show?
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
Yeah.
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Hey!
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you.
Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.
Huh, wanna bet?
Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far...
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Hey!
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Anybody gonna eat that?
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
I know, I can do this.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Between you and...
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Hey!
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Is Joey here?
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy.
What is it?
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
I-never borrowed your Walkman.
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Does it hurt?
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
Op, op, I'm convinced!
Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
All right!
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
So are we...friends again?
Yeah.
What 'cha doing Mon?
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
Okay that does sound like fun.
The second sister dies?!
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
What-what's so funny?
Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Okay.
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Yeah.
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Okay.
She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Stop what?!
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
What?
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Why not?
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
Really?!
Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
I found a dried up seashores.
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Yay!
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Still?!
Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Two.
Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Noo! Nothing!
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
I'm gonna call after you!
Woooo!!!
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
That's him.
Phoebe?
Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Bakersfield!
No-no I heard! I'm just sorry.
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
What?
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
What?
I have no idea what you just said.
Put Joey on the phone.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Wow.
Still doing the screening thing?
I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Oh, good job Joe.
Wow, it's big!
Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Noo! Angels.
I'm gettin' my chair back!
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Joey, why is your cable out?
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
When did I try to give you money?
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
Okay.
Really?
I know! I know.
Okay.
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
This is Patrick.
Hi.
Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
Yeah?
It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
Well, thanks again for lunch.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.
Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
Well, there you go.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
And why not?!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
No reason, except...she...told...me.
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
Hey, Mon, what is this?
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
Hey, you got me, put it in.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
Awww!
Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
What?!
What?!
Why does anyone have to be naked?
Why is Ross naked?
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
Why not?!
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
Yeah, what?
What?
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
I got glasses!
That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
...I'm, I'm okay.
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
You got it.
Okay.
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Here just...take this.
That's stealing!
Ohh.
Okay, one thing at a time.
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Consider Casey.
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Hey!
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Tony?
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Come on.
It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
So...Thank you.
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Weird world. Your kids?
I figure my character has kids.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Do you even know who Kip is?
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Oh, that poor bastard.
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
That's so gross!
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
I think you smell great!
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Now, have you told anyone else?
You told me.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Oh, we could do this all day.
Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
OK.
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
This is for the fourth grade.
Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Put Joey on the phone.
What's up man?
Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Drum roll.
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
You're definitely scaring here.
Would you like to call somebody?
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Screw the Knicks!
Whoa!
Huh.
And the Knicks rule all.
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Oop, your cake is ready!
Oop!
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
Who the hell are you?!
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
You're-you're what?!
I love you too Chandler.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Wafer thin ice!
Hey, I'm back!
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
What are you doing?
Waiting for candy.
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
We want candy! We want candy now!
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
'Tonight' tonight?
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Absolutely!
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
Like finding money with naked people on it!
Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
Oh, here.
See now it feels like Christmas!
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Yes!
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Not now, I'm sick!
Oh come on you big faker!
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
But, I love you.
And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
Hey you guys, guess what?
All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Just be yourself. But, not too much.
Wish me luck.
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
You promised you would break up with her!
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
Yeah, well...
We could get that Everest video though.
And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Oh, well...
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Next time?
Ooh, so close.
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Well, thanks.
Well, you know.
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
I'll talk to her.
I hate actors.
Excuse me.
Ahhhh.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Let me see the earrings.
Oh, honey, the earrings...
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
And ya know what, now I've got closure.
Try the bottom one.
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Oh, that's funny!
I want a baby.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Oooo-ooh!
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Come on look guys, don't fight.
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Hi!
Hey, you're back too!
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Why is that so funny?
You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Double it!
What?
Really?
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
More importantly, was I any good?
Well, you were pretty damn good.
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
I love it, when we share.
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
So where you gettin' it?
I think on my shoulder.
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
This, this actually is a...
Hey!
Oh, yeah.
Do we have to make the entire thing?
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
Alright.
Hi.
Hi.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Tell him.
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Why?
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Well, we certainly are alone.
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Right.
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Mon, get out here!
Monica!
Why do I have to decide?
Because you're the only one that can be fair.
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
Another hard 8.
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Something wrong?
No. Nothing.
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
What about things that are already gold?
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Chandler?
Hi. Hi.
What are you doing here?
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
What?
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Give him money? It was a joke!
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Two!
Three!
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Eh!
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Yeah.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
What, what's what you mean?
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Nice car!
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Is that a real thing?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
What's up?
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
I can't smell your sandwich?
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Okay.
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Big night!
This is so cool!
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Okay, he's a senior in college.
College?
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
What?
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Hey, man. What's up?
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
How is it you?
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
What are you doing?
No, only because that's the graduation song.
Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Okay!
No, but that's bad!
What?!
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Okay, this one I like!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
Um-hmm.
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
What?!
Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
Chandler, is that...
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Why?
Why would you kill his fish?
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
How was your first day?
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Hey!
Why?!
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
...Quality, right, great.
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
What? He's cute!
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Hey.
What's the matter?
Oh Willie's still alive!
What are you guys doing?
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Uh-huh.
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
You got it.
Okay, see ya later.
Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
He just said, "No strippers."
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
How about those three pointers?
Amazing!
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
See you later.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
Oh no!
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Well yeah, but then...
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Your messages have been erased.
Noooooooo!
No. But that reminds me, sign this.
What is it?
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
What-what Richard thing?
This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
No, I'm Mary-Theresa.
I am!
Oh, this is soo bad.
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
WHOAA!!
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
But we're not ready to tell yet!
Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
So what are you guys out doing today?
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
Ohhhh man
Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
No, but I'm gonna!
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
For three years?
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
"Smoke away."
What?
Relax your hand!
His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
That is correct.
The Irish gig guy?!
Gentlemen, you're pick.
It's All Relative.
Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Well all right, one thing happened?
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
That would be nice.
Pardon?
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Right.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
I'm not macho.
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Yeah?
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Really.
What, uh... what juggling thing?
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
And we don't work hard?
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
And you feel like we hold you back.
Yes.
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Who?
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
I don't think tho.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
Hat, milk, got it.
Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Dude! I am trying to sleep!
I know. Ross is getting married.
Phoebe is, making people.
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
What about when I started dating Chandler?
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Here, I brought you some flowers.
Thanks!
Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?
Yeah, welcome.
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
Hello?
Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
That's the rule.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Umm, cups.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
Rach, did you check the machine?
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
All right! You can have the chair.
Really!
See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me.
Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Why not?
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
Hi.
Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Yeah, I'll sit down.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
Really?
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
I'll go with you.
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Isn't there a national football league.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Ohhh.
What's wrong with the twentieth?
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler.
I'm Margha.
I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
Hello, Chandler.
Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.
So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Oh!
Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh boy me too!
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Hey Rach?
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Are you serious?!
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Maybe it was the guy.
It was the ring!
See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
I got a gig!
Yay!!
Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!
What's the part?
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
Are you travelling with a child?
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Shall I carve?
By all means.
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Is this guy great or what?
Yeah, yeah he is.
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
I know.
You're a really good kisser.
Hm-hmm!
Okay!
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
What's up?
You do?
Yeah.
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Oh my God!
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
Dude!
Sorry!
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
Well, I'm from California.
Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
I'll have coffee.
Yeah, me too.
I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
She?
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Excuse me?
Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
So what are you gonna do?
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
Pheebs!
Hey!
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
She-she died Jill.
Chandler!
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Carol?
Sure.
Uh, does it hurt?
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
Nine.
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
I am?
Sure, why not?
Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
Why, what happened?
What is the worse part?
I can't remember which sister.
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Rachel! That was a library card!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
No.
No.
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
No! No! No! I can't do that!
Why not?!
What's wrong with being the Bings?
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
That's the rule.
How'd you get to that?
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
One ticket to Yemen?
I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
It so does not!!!
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
No?
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Do we have to?
No.
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
Really?! You do that?
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
You have really great hair.
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
So this is your office?
What the hell are you doing?!
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Stop it!
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Yeah?
Geez! Are you ready?
Whoa! You had sex today?
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
'My scones.'
Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Did not.
I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Let them win one.
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
No. Not anymore.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
I want you to say that you like her!
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
How could you have told her?
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Thanks!
Yeah right.
Why is that so funny?
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Ohh-oh, chilling!
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Alimony.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
How is that worse?!
I don't know! But it's the same!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
So take care.
You too.
Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Sophie's desk.
All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
How do you not fall down more?
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Well at least we know she's a woman.
I can't believe she's married.
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
All right.
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
God, your hair sure is different!
So uh, where's Monica?
She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
I'm intrigued.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Since when are you into swing music?
Chandler.
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
True story!
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
Yeah me too.
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Why don't you open with a joke?
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
Okay!
Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Morning. We ready to go?
It was a really beautiful service.
It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Okay.
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Why would you kill his fish?
Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
Yeah.
Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
I know. It's just such reckless spending.
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
That's me.
Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Oh, mine's December...
Yeah, whatever.
Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
I could die.
Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
What is this?
It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
Oh, no thanks.
Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
Good luck!
Out!
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.

Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Dude! He's right there!
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Can I finish my story?!
Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Oh, ohhhhh.
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Alright open your eyes.
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
Hello New York!
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
Hi Chandler.
Hey!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
We didn't ruin it!
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
Glove salesman!
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got.
What?
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Not once did we do that.
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Do you realize you get louder each week?
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Waaa-aaah.
What?
Yeah, so.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Let me see that! Oh man!
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
I made a...
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Ok, you win.
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
Uh huh. Why is that?
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
I sure did.
Why?
Well, you're amazing.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Wow, how many have you got?
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
No! Ahhh!!!
I don't believe this!
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Hey.
Hey.
I'll get it.
Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Come here. Okay, be right back.
We're switching rooms.
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
That word was swans.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
The meeting with the guy went great?
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
What are you going to make?
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!

There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Hey.
Hey! Good, you're home!
Hey baby.
Hey.
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Well, I'm there too!
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
I'm so sorry!
Sorry!
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
What happened to the foosball?
Ah that's a cantelope.
He paid a lot of money for it.
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
Please.
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Well, thank you for lunch.
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
Its still there!
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
Hi.
How's it going?
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
C'mon, it's my birthday.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
I mean, this is unbelievable.
I know. This is really, really huge.
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
BEND OVER?!!!
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought.
...And what did you bring?
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
Joey, why is your cable out?
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Whoa ho.
Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
So, are you sorry that I told them?
Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
I got it! Here we go.
Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be...
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
No?
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Well where did she go?
Well she said she had to think things over.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
You were trying to eat it!
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
What are you talking about?
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
Well where... Where did she go?
OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
I know what your problem is.
Oh you do, do you?
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Thank you, buddy.
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
So how was Joan?
I broke up with her.
Come on, they were not that huge.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
I'm not macho.
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
And then we've gotta get some sleep.
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Bye.
Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Oh my God!
Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
So how'd it go?
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
No! No! Not, Paris.
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Oh my God! That is so good!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
There I am!
Are you okay?
What?!
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Oh, So you can move them!
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
Hi.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Is it on?
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
So, what're you gonna do?
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
I've never slept with someone for a part.
Well is she...
What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Oh, come on! Come on!
No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Well, then can we meet him?
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Chandler!
Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
There's our star!
So, so, what'd ya think?
I-I wasn't in that.
I know.
Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
Huh.
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
... the WENUS?
Oh. That WENUS.
So what're you going to do?
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
So where are we going next?
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
I can't sleep now.
You want me to sing?
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Where've you been?
At the vet.
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Hey! He beat ya.
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
This should be fun.
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
That would be no.
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
I thought your time ran out.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-
Oh.
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Yeah?
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
That's me! Come on!
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Well that's how I feel.
Well then maybe you should take it.
It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Funny story!
You're not going to believe this!
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Again?
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
The Ross-Is that back?!!
Hi!
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Okay, great.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
We're switching rooms again.
What? Why?
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.
Hello.
No he, he moved out and I moved in.
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
My-Oh my God!
I know! They suck!!
I know!
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Ready!
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
This is not a sign!
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Five.
How many guesses do you get?
Six.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Why?
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Oh my God! That's David!
David who?
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Hi!
That is one good looking man!
Sooo, you've been doing this long?
No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Nooo.
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Yeah!
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Oh, well great.
Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
The balloon?
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Keep going.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Get out!!
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
No.
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
No.
No.
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Well maybe I love ya'.
.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Okay!
Come on, no peeking!
Okayyyyy, open up!
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Because, I'm too afraid.
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Rachel?
Yeah.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Well, I never call me.
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
You're bachelor pad?!
Have you even had a girl up here?
Yeah, you do!
Come on!
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Nice to meet you.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
Chandler!
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
Oh, that was my work laugh.
Really? Your work laugh?
All right, check me out.
Okay.
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Hello, funny Valentine.
Hi, Just Janice.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Bye-bye-e!
Bye.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Oh my God!
Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Sure. I'll help you.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Ohh.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Who the hell is Carl?!
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
The only problem!
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
No thanks, Josephine.
Ohh, hi, Kim.
Hi Rachel.
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
You knew about that?
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Why don't you just take it with you?
Why don't you just call her?
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Yeah, o-okay.
So...
Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
It doesn't say that. Does it?
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?
Nice to meet ya.
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Umm, this is nice.
I know, it is isn't it?
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
This is the most special day of our lives.
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Oh, okay. Here you go.
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait!
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
I'm gonna have to give him up.
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
What?
That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
So?
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Y'miss it?
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
That's ridiculous!
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
When did that happen to you?!
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
What's you point man?
Ok, good night. You big freak of nature.
You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
Yeah, I'm her date.
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
Ya know, the man's got a point.
What is that sparkly thing?
No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Bad London!
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Only here.
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
No.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
All right, bye-bye.
We'll give you Janice.
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Oh no, you're the best.
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Alright, let's do this.
Alright.
Whad'ya mean?
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
Marcel?
Hi, can I help you?
A monkey.
Yes have you seen any?
It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
Oh, you should here me.
Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
They don't have those.
Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!
What thing? What thing?
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. Easy.
What thing? What is this thing?
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Hey!
Hi.
Yeah, it did.
So, I guess this is over.
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
I'm a little busy here Paul.
That's exactly what my dad used to say!
Five more seconds.
Okay!
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
We're very happy for you.
What's the matter?!
All right, I'll take care of it.
Oh no, wait! Joey!
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
All right, what's going on there?
Where were your parents?
Oh they didn't want to come!
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Man!
Hi!
Do you have a minute?
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Paris?
Keep talking.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Y'miss it?
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
Fine! Get out!
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
She already lives in London.
Then you go to Tokyo.
It is not over! You're over!
What?
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
Let's go!
No-no-no! We need something old!
That'll work!
I don't think so.
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Oh thanks.
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
Ready!
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Okay, fine.
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Uuuh.
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
What?
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
I know!
Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Yeah? Hi!
That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Hey! You're wearing pants!
It's 9:30 in the morning!
They got a breakfast buffet.
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
About what?
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Okay, I...
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Hey-hey, what's going on?
Thanks for telling me!
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
I gave you one job!
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
I just... can't do it.
Boys? We're going in.
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
That's not a question.
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Thanks.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
Then why would he say it?
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
Hey, Janice.
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
What?
Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Oh, in that case--Yay! That was me hopping on board.
Oh.
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
Yes, I am!
Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Oh my God! What happened?
So, how was your date?
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
That's fun.
Here you go.
Thank you. Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, you're on.
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Oh God!
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
They tore it down a few days early.
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
Really? To what?
To Put the Camera Away!!!
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
Hey!
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
I'm sorry.
Ohhh. Don't go.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
: I thought we had them!
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is.
Oh, time's up.
Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Why?
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
At a fake game!!
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
No.
Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
We don't have to come up with this now.
Oh good.
Changes?
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Well, thanks.
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
I don't know.
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...
...little playthings with yarn?
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
Who's singing?
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Sorry.
Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
I know you do. Me too. So what now?
I guess we just keep dancing.
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Huh. That's nice.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
What-what are you doing?
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
What?!
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
I'm having a really good time!
Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
You have really great hair.
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
What-what 'cha doin'?
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
What?!
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
Ohh.
Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
Aaahhhh. AAAAHHHHHH.
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Woah!
Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
You know what makes the itching even worse?
That you don't stop talking about it.
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
So was it a lot more money?
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
Oh, you're-you're going?
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
Hi.
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
No you can't.
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Okay.
Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
Yeah, it is.
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
...He's in.
Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Raymond Chandler.
Someone you didn't make up!
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
What?! Noooo...
We didn't ruin it!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Ohh, I love birds.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Hey!
What are you doing here, Santa?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
What?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
You really think that'll work?
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Well, I did not know that.
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
Yeah, I remember.
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
Thanks.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Just please stop!
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Awwwwwwww.
Does anybody want these?
Hey.
Hey!
I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
I can't believe you're not picking me.
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
So, you feel like a dad yet?
No, why?
Oh, look, he's waking up!
hey, fella! How you doing?
Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are "There are no rules."
Oh.
And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
You're meeting Richard?
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
Oh, you're-you're going?
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Where are they? Where are they?
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Eww, I don't wanna do that.
Here we go.
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Why?
Fat?!
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
I brought you something.
I had them made special.
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Hey Joe!
Hey!
Hey, Pheebs!
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
Oh my God!
Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
I know!!
Okay, then get the lobster!
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Well that sounds fun too.
Have you ever been with a woman?
Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
More of Grandma's teramisu.
That dies with me.
So will I.
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Yes!
Seriously?
I'm 30!
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Thanks!
Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
Come on.
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
Hey, I went up.
What?
No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
I know.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
I do NOT want this unit!!
Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!
Thank you.
Okay.
What's wah-pah?
Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Changes?
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Is that a problem?
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Pretty much.
All right.
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
Oh my God!
You're smoking again?!
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Even with me?
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Nuh-uh.
Yuh-huh.
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
Hi.
Hey!
Ah-ha!
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
You think we're ready for something like that?
Why not?
Why, are you moving out?
I'm not moving out.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
'Cause I was sitting there.
But then you left.
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
She really said that?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Which one was Pete Carney?
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Just those two!
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
Here.
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
Are you serious?
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Joey!
Yeah?
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
I'll be waiting.
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
No.
Phoebe. Hi.
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
What? Mine aren't tinted.
Chandler!!
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Dude, don't do that too me!
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Hey!
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
I'm reading your ad.
Looks good, uh?
You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
I will not take this abuse.
You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Yeah, all of us! All day!
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Well, this has been fun.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Is anybody else scared?
'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
Oh, now you want a pad.
Hey!!
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Yeah.
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
One second.
I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
It's so secluded up here.
I know. I like it up here.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Hi!
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!
No!! You can't!!
Look, they must be stopped!
I need juice! People need juice!!
Look man!
C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
You bitch.
Whip it out, whip it out.
Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Sir.
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Eh?
Really?
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Yes, Denise. Denise!
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Well, you know.
Uh-huh.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
Love....
I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Yeah, you should, really.
Go on.
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
Your last roommate's kidney?
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Well, look at that, same thing.
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Oh, hello Rachel.
Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Alrightalrightalright. There.
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Please, can't you help me out?
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
Op, I like credit cards!
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Come on, we can't let them win!
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
I know. My arm is killing me.
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
What's going on?
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Ive never done that.
Im sayin I see a difference.
Theyre twins!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
I do like that.
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
Hey.
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Okay, there.
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
You are, you're gonna leave me like this?
Knowing you're here, waiting for me I think it's kinda exciting.
Oh.
Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
Awesome!
Yeah?
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
Hey!
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Really?
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
Maye it's me.
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
There we go. All better.
There's my little boy.
Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.
OK.
Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Tell me what?
Look at you, you won't even look at him.
All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Doing it on this table.
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
Those were like the best seats ever.
Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
Oh. Oh, God!
Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh yeah!
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
Hey.
Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Well, I did not know that.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
By me?
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
I know!
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
That was so lame.
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Okay. It's a racecar.
So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Right! And when is that due?
First of the month.
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Okay.
Okay.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Yeah.
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
Of course!
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
She's not here and please come in.
Okay, she was here, but she left.
Well where did she go?
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Oh! Oop!
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Hi guys.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
That's my first name.
Right, okay, then no.
Yay!
See? Here we go.
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Yeah, I do, yeah.
Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!
Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
So what're you guys gonna eat?
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
I want you right here, right now.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
You got it.
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
I didn't know you had another level.
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
Picking Rachel.
That's right. Did you hear something?
It's coming from the living room.
I finished my book.
Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
I'll take that.
You want his yearbook?
Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
It's really not that big!
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Well, if you think it will help.
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
There he is!
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Me.
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Monica's pregnant.
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?
Cigarettes?!!
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Hey, it's me.
It's Chandler! Are you OK?
What?
I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
That word was swans.
Oh! Oh my God!
Merry Christmas!!
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Uh-huh.
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
You want some help.
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
You are so great! I love you!
What?
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No I didn't!
Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
Oh, yeah.
You comin'?
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
Sure.
You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
What did you tell them?
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
Oh, no.
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
Yeah baby!
Oh.
But then later that night...
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
Cups.
I don't know how to play Cups.
All right.
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Can I just say one thing?
What? What?!
Oh!!
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
No kidding.
Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Because the winner gets this!
The Geller Cup.
Yeah.
Okay, good.
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
Oh that's me, I gotta go.
Oh uh, o, OK.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Oh, I know.
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Oh thank you.
Okay.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
Yeah.
I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
Oh, hi!
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
Woo-hoo, stuud!
What's she look like?
Woo-hoo, geeek!
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
It doesn't say that!
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
There you go!
See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
You really didn't have to. Wow.
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .
Oh, yeah... yeah.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
All right!
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Hey Joe!
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Hi!
Hi.
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Yes!!
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Really?! You promise?
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Hey!
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Men are unbelievable.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Hey, you know about that?!
Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
Oh really, you guys tryin' again?
Yeah.
C'MON!
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Friends first? That's interesting.
You become friends after?
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Why is your family Ross?!
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
Hi Pheebs!
Hi!
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
Well, how much do you think he needs?
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
My Giant? I love that movie!
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Huh.
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Is there a Julio here?
I am Julio.
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
98 hot saves, highest in the force.
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
You're right, I know.
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
How do you figure that?
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Umm, jealous!
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Um-hmm.
Not really.
Well there you have it!
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
Alright.
OK. Just for a little while.
OK.
Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Why? What happened now?
Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Each.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Hey Monica, it's Chip.
Yesss!!
Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
Score.
She is so hot!
Pheebs?
Yeah?
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
You did?
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
I did.
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Umm, oh, about three months.
Hey!!
Hey!
Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
What do you say?
You're bachelor pad?!
Have you even had a girl up here?
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
Multiple orgasms!
No plans, huh?
Not a one.
No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a...
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Hey guys! What's...
Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Put it on.
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
I so am.
Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
I ran!!
Actually, me too.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
We have free porn here!!!
Hey!
Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
All right.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
I can check that for ya.
I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Yeah, what's that about?
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Oh, I can still do that.
How are you still single?!
Good. What made you change your mind?
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Well no, but um.
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
So, you feel like goin' for a run?
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
Hey!
Don't come out here!
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
: Your Visa bill is huge!
Give me that!
I don't know.
Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Karen.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Okay, here we go. Ready?
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
Ooh, your brother. Score!
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Hey.
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
All right.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!
Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
How are you feeling?
Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Please!
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Oh, now I have to go!!
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
Uh, Julie.
Yeah?
Hi everyone.
Hi.
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Well, apparently she does.
Hey! What's going on?
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Are you not seeing him anymore?
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
Umm, yeah.
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
Volleyball.
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Dennis.
Ok, that's me.
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
What did you say?
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Her answer machine?
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
Oh.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
C'mon hurry, hurry.
Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
All right.
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
The doctor.
Is everything okay?
Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
What?!!
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
They're gonna call her Chandler.
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
So, should I call him back?
Noo! NO!
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
All right!
That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
That is so good! Do it again!
All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
No no, that's me.
Oh, yeah.
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Done!
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
Hey.
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
What?
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
We don't need to remedy that.
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
Why two?
Because it's faster.
Oh!
All right, but in the future...
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Hey!
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Really? Right across the street?
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
I'm pregnant.
Pregnant?!
...Then I've already seen this one!
Are you through with that?
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
Who wrote it?
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
Okay, can we please go eat?
Yeah. What are we getting?
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Weren't you nine?!
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
Him? Him, Ross?
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Yeah, why not?
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
No reason, except...she...told...me.
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
You mean like, music?
Come in!
Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch?
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
That was...so good.
Hey.
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Not if you're gonna be like this!
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
Y'think?
Yeah!
C'mon! C'mon!
Here goes.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Do you want a date Saturday?
Yes please.
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
What?!
Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...
Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
God, I love these fingers...
Thank you.
Oh my God, I'm late.
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
I will go for that drink.
Each.
That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
I KNEW IT!!!!
Gin.
Will you stop!
Okay. All right.
Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
All right then, your bra would still be big.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
The lights, please..
...How long was I in there?
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Hey.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
And twenty-five it is.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Well, I have a call in about that.
'Kay.
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Um... hi there.
Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Yeah, yeah!
Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
That was me.
That's okay.
That's all right.
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Ehh.
Eh, you work for that.
You do?!
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
We're never gonna find anybody.
Well then let me do it!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Hey Joe!
I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Wait, does he eat chalk?
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Yes, we should. I think we should.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Yeah, it is.
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
You're okay there?
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Hello Rachel.
Get off.
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
That's a line from the show too!
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
Yeah?
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
You wanna play?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
I'm intrigued.
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
So?
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Awww. But still no.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
Really? Who's number two?
Uh, no, it's-it's just this person.
Like a date type person?
Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Oh! What is that? What is that?
Come on, let me see that smile.
I don't wanna.
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you...
I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
I-I think we have too.
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Well, Joey's my best friend.
I'm not your best friend?
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
Okay. Oh yes.
Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Okay.
What happened?
He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
Yeah. You!
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Love is the best medicine.
That's laughter.
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Whad'ya mean?
No, you can't use your watch.
Ok.
Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Yeah, so?
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Why?
Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?
It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
You have three nipples?
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Bye! Thank God
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
What?!
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
So uh, what did this woman look like?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
Hell, I wanna see Joey.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
All I say is, she better get the job.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
Okay.
Hey! New wallet, huh?
Rachel!
What?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Well, there you go.
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
You're welcome.
Did you smoke?
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
Karen.
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
We were out of Doritos.
Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
Still?!
We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
Yeah!
Hey!
Hey!
Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
What?!! Gross!!
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Yeah baby! No baby!
No because it-it didn't seem important.
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Well, apparently she does.
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Well, my nose got lonely.
Hi, I'm Lisa.
Hi.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Hi there.
That's that weird voice again.
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
Hi!
Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this...
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
Why not?
Hey man.
Hey!
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Don't blame the questions!
Will you stop calling it your apartment!
But it is our apartment!
Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Just pickle.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward.
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Or not, whatever.
This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Okay. Will you marry me?
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
This is crazy.
I know! Robin is so gay!
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
You're right.
Yeah!
Okay.
Okay great.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Oh!!
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
I say push her down the stairs.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
Please tell me you got the message!
What message?
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
I'm Monica.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Ohh.
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
Totally!
We don't have to come up with this now.
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh my god.
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
We did?
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
Hello, Chandler Bing.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
But, I love you.
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
Why?
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
I, I know.
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
What were you modeling for?
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
I'm already here.
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
No, the little girl creeps me out.
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
But the mess!
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Hey. Where's Joey?
I think he's across the hall.
Thanks.
Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
Oh.
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
He's kind of intense huh?
Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Oh, okay. Here you go.
Hey, where's the chicken?
Great. I'll see you later!
Okay, bye!
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
That's my pie!
Which smells delicious!
Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight.
Another hard 8.
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Go! Come on! Roll!
Roll-roll!!
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Oh, my.
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Why? Why can't you go to him?
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Did you break up with her?
Why?
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
You pick one.
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Good choice.
Thanks.
How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.
Hello?
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
What's-what's the difference?
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
Knock, knock.
Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
It's Monica's bed. What?
Okay. It's a racecar.
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
It was my racquet.
I was frustrated with you!
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Oh my God. He threw up?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Why not her?
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
Joey that is horriable.
Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Your boyfriend is so cool.
Really?
Wow, he must like you the best.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats .
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
No! We only mess around at his place!
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
No, I haven't seen him.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
Yeah, why?
No reason.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
What?!! What?
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
He's... new.
No, that's not exactly what I was..
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
She's bluffing!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
I'm sorry Joey.
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Ross came in forth and cried!
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Who is Maria?
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
No!
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Our little boy is getting married.
Oh look at you! So handsome!
Are you Chandler?
Are you Joey?
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Oh, sure! I'm sure.
I know.
Ennnh.
I've got canned goods.
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
What?
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
Quick volleyball question.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
You're actually going through with this?
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
Yeah, I do.
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
For three years?
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
Okay!
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
Oh uh, o, OK.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
No one was around to hear that?
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
What about him?
Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Are you seein her again tonight?
Yep. Ice Capades.
I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
Here's your tea Phoebe.
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Oh.
Joe. How's it going?
Good. Hey.
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Really?
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Oh.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'
He's right, even if it's to say something complementary.
Hey!
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
What does it say?!
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Thanks! So are you.
I told you I should not wear this color.
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Hey-hey-hey Joey!
Hey Terry!
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Hey!
You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Oh, youre gonna be great!
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Wherere you going?
Out.
I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Thanks for telling me!
Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Okay, great!
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
I'll take sports.
Mine!
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Oh, okay.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
You're so efficient. I love you!
Let's go!
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
You left a shoe here?!
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Great! Thanks.
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
I'm gonna do it.
I don't know what else to say.
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Hey!
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
What do you mean?
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's...
Come here.
Are you sure?
Beefsteak Charlie's?
Yes! See you and I have always been like-
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
No, I got him.
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Hey.
How was your conference?
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
Sort of...
Guys, what's going on?
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
Which one?
...The second guy.
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
That's not what she said last night.
See? Now, he could date her.
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
Hey!
Thank you soo, much.
You want some help with that?
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!
We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
I was in too much pain.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
What kind of changes?
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Why?
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
I gotta go!
Hey.
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
About a half an hour.
Lovely!
No.
Why not?
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Quick! What time is it?!
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
Yeah?
Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
I don't know, I don't know.
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Frankie? What're you talking about?
Hey, what's goin' on?
You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
Talk to me.
OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
What the hell are you doing?!
She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
No! No! No! I can't do that!
Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
What?!
So you were right?
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Come on, two on one.
What, now?
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
What?
You, you want, you want me to move out?
Uh-huh.
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Yeah, Big Brother.
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Eh...
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo.
Wow.
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
When I got married you slept with my sister.
That was pretty 007.
Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
What?
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
What is this? Fruit?
Monica's making jam.
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Hey-hey listen...
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
What?
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.
See ya.
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
I say, punch him Joey.
Yeah! Punch him!!
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Hi, Julie!
Hi, Julie.
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
This was your idea?
What were you thinking?
Yeah. You!
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Okay.
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
All right!!
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Yeah.
Well, those were seals, man.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Hey!
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
Twice.
Man, I sure miss Julie.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Why not?
Oh.
DANGER!!!!!
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
You want me to wear your panties?
Could ya?
OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.
Oooh.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Rach? What are you doing?
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
What?
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Uh, 10:30.
What time is it now?
Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
No.
Five more and I'll flash you.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Right.
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
Oh yeah, that's over.
What?!
He shot a bird!
Oh that is over!
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
No.
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Okay, great.
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Who's he huggin'?
Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
We use it!!
There you go!!
Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
One ticket to Yemen?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Still broken?
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Nah, not my game.
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Hey!
It's almost our anniversary!
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Huh.
They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
I did.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
'Scuse me.
It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
How did you--?
Thanks.
No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
What happened?!!
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
So-You got in voluntarily?!
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't- I mean, I-
I know-
I can't believe you did this.
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
Hi.
Hey.
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Whoa ho.
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
Sure.
Paid your phone bill?
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
How's that coffee comin,' dear?
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
I knew you were not okay with that.
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Because!
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Someone in there?
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
Why should we?
Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
You got a problem with that?
No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
No! No! Not, Paris.
When?
I don't know exactly.
No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Good.
Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Why not?
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
So how'd it go?
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?
She laughed at you?
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!
Freedom!
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Sophie sit!!
No! God, would you just calm down!
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
All right.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Ross!
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Sure.
No problem.
That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Cool.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Waaa-aaah.
What?
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Ohh that's sweet!
Oh my God!
I know, but just let me say it.
Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
Goodnight.
Um, thank you for the gift.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
Uh, the book?
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
I'm not mad.
Really?!
Great!
Okay, London 1...
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
It's me. I'm the other guy.
What?
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.
What?
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
Yeah.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
Who?
It's me. I'm the other guy.
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Oh, okay, thanks.
Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
Oh, you should here me.
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
Yeah.
No, we never do that
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
The fear?
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
Because, I'm too afraid.
Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
Hi.
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
Thanks.
Oh, oh, c'mon in.
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
I know I love you!
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
No that could kill her.
Well, we don't want that.
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
OK.
This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
You mean this.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Okay.
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Oh... Uh...
So, who's the lucky guy?
Well, she saw the ring.
Did she freak out?
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Yeah! You wanna come?
Yeah!
Can I help you?
Uh-oh.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
Oh please!
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
No way, forget it.
C'mon, she's your mom!
All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
What?
You're in my seat.
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Shhhh!
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
What? That's like insanely easy!
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
It's a good play, isn't it?
Okay, I...
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
I can do that!
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Okay.
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Okay.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Nooo!
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.
Thank you.
Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
What?
I feel...
But I made cards!!
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
What?!
Oh my God, you guys!!
Who?
Richard!
I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Oh. That WENUS.
So what're you going to do?
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Um... hi there.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
No, Janice.
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Hey, is Rachel here?
No.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
I don't like your massages.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Let's go watch it at your place.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Oh my god!
I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
I know, it's horrible isn't it?
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
Hm-mm.
Ohh!
We're sorry honey.
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
How could you lose him?
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
...Hm.
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
You gotta take the canoe!
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
Good for you!!
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Thank God.
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Stop it!
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Yeah?
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
Pass it! Pass it!
He's open!
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
All right, buddy!
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Come on, it's fun!
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Yeah, so.
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
What?! What?!
Oh yes!
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Nooo!
Please!
Wow! What's that like?
It's like this, me, no jokes.
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
'Kay!
Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Weren't you nine?!
Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
Ohh that's sweet!
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Hey.
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
That's great! That's wonderful!
Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
Um-mm, yeah right!
He's so cute.
Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Oh yeah...
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Could you guys help me?
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Mm-mmm.
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
I know. That's what I told her.
Really.
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
What about your breath?!
Okay. I can do that.
Okay.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
But I love swing music!
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Well, what is the other reason?
I don't want to say.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
You told her before you told us?
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
What's with him?
Ugh!
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
You got all that from the back of her head?
Who's Elaine?
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
What?
She wants to meet you in person.
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
Okay, I'll do it!
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Well, like father, like son.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh boy me too!
Yeah?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
How could you tell her?!
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Du-ude!
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
We should?
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Centerpieces!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Uh-huh!
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Hey.
What?
Do you say this stuff to girls?
Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
By someone besides Monica?
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
What?
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Dude!
God!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
If you wanna call that a reason.
Ross, I thought you were over this.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Honestly? Me too.
Really?
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Okay. I'll be right there.
Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
I think it went into me.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
Ok, who ordered what?
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
Congratulations.
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
C'mon, tell us.
Yeah, is she really 20.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Dark red.
Yes, you are so smart!
Aww, you guys are so cute!
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Hmm.
Chandler is fantastic!!
What?!
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
You serious?
Oh yes!
Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
Have you seen Joey?
What's the matter?
Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
What's going on?
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Pshhshhh!
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
Hi!
Hi!
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
We said seven!
We said six!
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
Hi!
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
That really was some of your best work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
Okay.
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
You were great. But they still made fun of you.
What?
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
You don't need to fill these silences.
Oh, okay, thanks.
See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.
Hey no problem.
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Welcome home man.
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Right.
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
Well, I think so.
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
Hi!
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
What?!
Chandler, what were you thinking?
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
You okay over there?
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Hey!
Hi!
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
You could say that.
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
I don't know.
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
Right in there!
Hey!
Hey!
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Ummmmmmmm, no.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
It's 4:30.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
You-you do?
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
No.
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
What what what what?
Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Hey.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.
No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Yeah?
Good call!
What's my last name?
Central Perk?
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Never had that dream.
No.
And they weren't looking at you before?!
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!
Nooo, it wasn't.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Hey, I've been honing!
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
What?!
Okay, break-up's still on!
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Hi guys!
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Oh great!
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
See you later Rach.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Why are your eyes so white?
Oh my God!!
All right!
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Yes that was a nice place!
Yeah!
Yeah!
What are we gonna do?
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
Hey, be right there.
There's a game?
It's the basketball playoffs.
Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
What is she doing here?
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
Great!
Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Hey.
No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Hey!
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Where ya going?
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Am I naked again?!
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
No no no!
If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Yeah, alright.
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
Don't you have to use the bathroom?
Someone in here.
Where's Chandler?
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Come on look guys, don't fight.
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
Oh. Hel-lo!
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
You guys, I am not that bad!
Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
I can't believe we live here!
Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
People can hear you.
I know!!
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
How'd you get to that?
You knew about that?
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
Whoa, you are very beautiful.
Oh, thank you.
Honey, what's the matter?
I just saw Janice.
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
Does it hurt?
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
About what?
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Ready? Wrestle!
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Joey's not going.
I didn't finish my five pages.
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
Have you been here all night?
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
Daaahhhh!
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
I wa-
Uuuh.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
That's all you're basing this on?
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
But I'm...
Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Sure. Okay.
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
You mean scared.
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Monica?
What?!
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
Okay.
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Honey, this will help.
Uff.
That is never good.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
This bicep?
Well it's not flexed right now!
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
Uh-huh, yeah.
That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
Nighty-nite.
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
What?!
Can you really do that?
I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Sure. Ummm. What's up?
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
You betcha!
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Are you alright?
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Hey, my Father's house does that!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Hmm.
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
Good morning.
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Well, I like it. Here you go.
Oh, I embarrass you?
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Uh, sure, why not.
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
It's the Knicks!
Screw the Knicks!
Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
That's that weird voice again.
Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Hi!
Hi!
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
I don't want to do that.
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Why is everything different?
Bye!
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
You can pee here!
Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
Yeah!
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Oh, well give me the phone then.
Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Y'know what, pretty good.
Yeah?
Thank you.
Here you go.
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
It's pretty clear.
That's why you broke up with me?
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
Funniest? Heckles?
That's what it says.
I'd call that excessive.
Whoa!
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
She was kidding.
Yeah.
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
It-it doesn't?
No!
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
I want you right here, right now.
Meet me in the bathroom.
I'm going to the bathroom now.
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Then be supportive like a guy.
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
That's all you're basing this on?
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Oh my God!!
Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
All right buddy, way to go!
Dude, what are you doing?
Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Yeah, she's...
You love her.
No, I don't.
Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
That's a good idea for a business!
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
What?!
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Really?
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Sure.
No problem.
Petrie.
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
Well it's not Sean Penn.
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Hey, gorgeous.
Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
Oh! Okay! Phew!
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
We are so gonna find them this year.
Yeah.
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Bye! Thank God
Dude, what'd you have?
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
Hey!
What's going on?
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
You are really frightening me.
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
All right, honey, time to start pushing.
Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
Sure, why not?
Oh my god! Youre amazing!
So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
What?
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
All right!
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
Hummus. I got the hummus.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Well, it involved Monica.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
So what does this mean?
Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.
Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
You mean you didn't get it from this?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
What are you writing?
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Hi guys!
Hey!
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
Oh, I don't know, a million?
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Why?
Told ya.
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Whoa, snowing out there?
No.
Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
Hey.
Hey.
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Oh my God!
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Settle what?
The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Oh. Right.
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name.
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
Ginger.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Excuse me?
What?
Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
You don't think I get up when you get up?
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Monica!
She's sleeping.
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Chandler, Chandler.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
Aww, man!
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
Any luck?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
You want me to wear your panties?
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
This one?
No.
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
I made that joke up.
Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.
Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'
What?
Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
How do I look?
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
...And what did you bring?
I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
Thank you.
Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
How's the hired help?
All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Shut up, and put my table back.
Okayyy!
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Great! Okay, here.
All right.
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
Eh..., I don't, I don't know.
What?
Rachel?
Yeah.
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Hey!
What are you guys doing up?
Dark red.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
I think I should get the chair!
How do you figure?
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Well, where's the logic in that?!
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Sounds like a date to me.
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Chandler!
Monica.
Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
He is?
Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
An advance?
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Nah, not my game.
Well, what's it called?
Cups.
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Do we have to make the entire thing?
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
What?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Career counselor?
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Not yet.
Then, no.
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
God?
Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Anything else?
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
Um, everyone?
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
Yeah, well...
Hi!
Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Do I look fat?
Noo.
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Hey!
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
You built a fort didn't ya?
Kinda.
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
I hate this thing!
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
What are these, like famous chickens?
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Phil.
Phil!
Hey, what's going on?
Monica's a little drunk.
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
He's a he?
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
You did?
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
So?
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Two.
I had one glass.
OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
Oooooh.
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
He's coming over! He's coming over!
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Can you blame him?
Well then we still have a problem.
Yeah!
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
It's not that bad.
Chandler, Chandler.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
Hey!
Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Okay, okay, what's going on?
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Oh my God!
It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
Ohh.
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
I say, punch him Joey.
Yeah! Punch him!!
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Yeah!
Oh my God!
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
From a bullet!
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Hey!!
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
You didn't just break up.
Hey, it's been like three weeks!
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
Okay.
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
Woo-hoo, geeek!
Get out!
Nooo!
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
Yeah, all right. Ooh!
Joey!
Hey!
Did you find it?
Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Hey.
Oh no! What's the matter?
Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
Okay.
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Aw, I know all about Kip!
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Aw, don't do that
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
Whoa! Ohh!!
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
So are things with you and Joey any better?
Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Good morning.
Hey.
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
No, it's too soon for you guys.
Yeah, you're right about that.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Why-why would I care about that?
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
I would really love it if could do both.
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
Bye, good luck.
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .
What does she mean by HH?
It means we're holding hands.
Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
May I help you?
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Tell him.
It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
No because it-it didn't seem important.
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
No.
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
All right that's it, school is in session!
My God! Is this a gym card?
So why don't you quit?
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Monica what?
What?!
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
And a crappy New Year.
Here, here!
He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Are you okay?
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Well, John McLane had plans!
What are you talking about? Bitch.
Hey Rachel?
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
Well, can you dance at all?
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
Dude.
Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
Here goes.
...Yes?
Yes, you said that.
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
Yeah?
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
Here we go again.
I-I can't handle this, you guys.
All right Pheebs, your cab's ready.
All right, let's go!
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Come on, we can't let them win!
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
So?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
What?
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
Am not!
Who is that?!
My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
Hi!
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Hey-hey.
So are guys doing okay?
Yeah baby!
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
... And where's this money coming from?
No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
The Ice Capades?
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Luck!
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
What?
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
Since when are you into swing music?
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
We can't do that.
Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
Hi, nice to meet you!
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
"Benefits lapsed."
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Let me see that!
All right.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
Her what?
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
So you're really okay with this?
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
You guys! You guys!
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Sure!
Chandler! Is he?
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
Please.
C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
OK, let's do it. What?
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
How did that happen?!!
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
: So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
...Yeah.
Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
...Yeah?
Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
And she's not crazy?
Oh my God.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
I don't!
Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
I can't, I gotta go.
Almost never.
Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
Who, Josh?
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Tomorrow night.
Monica, what are you doing?
It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Oh, get out of here!
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak.
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
Once!!
All right, we're gonna play.
Okay. Let's bring it in.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
You told me.
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
Me too.
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
You work with robots!!
Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
Bing! That's a great name.
Me too.
Bye, Chandler.
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Umm, okay.
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Why not?!
What?!
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Yeah, what's that about?
You're good. These are not.
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
Chandler.
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
Hey!
Hey-hey, check out the hat!
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Ross gave it to me.
Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
You broke a little girl's leg?!!
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
4:00 A.M.
So, can I get some candy?
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Hey.
Hey.
Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
Then why would he say it?
Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Do not speak ill of the dead.
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
No way, forget it.
C'mon, she's your mom!
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Come on man, really how old?!
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
That's too much. Sorry.
So, how was the party?
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Wow! I would trade.
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
You're dying?!
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Aw.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
I know!
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
You're right.
Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
What happens if you flick it?
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Hi everyone.
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
And your friend Phoebe?
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
Okay, errrr, Monica?
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
We haven't eaten yet!
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just...
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Wh-wh-why?!
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Hi.
Hey.
Uh, yeah.
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Okay, good bye!
Umm, oh, about three months.
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
No.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
You think?
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
Why, why not?
Because it's too delicious.
Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
Okay, let's play my game now.
Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
You remember Janice, right?
Helloo!!
Oh, my, god!
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
All right.
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Hey.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Um-hmm.
Uh-oh.
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
Well.
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
I'll get the hat.
Okay.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Well, I think so.
Hi. Where is everybody?
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Yeeeeahhhh.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah we are!
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
They have racquets don't they?!
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Oopsey, missed it!
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Like?
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Might wanna try Joseph.
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!
Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Okay, fine, fine. You don't want to believe me? No, that's fine.
We're kidding!
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
What's up?
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
But you're still my friend?
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
What's up?
Sure. Okay.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
Forget her! You enjoy this!!
What are you doing?
Are you okay?
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Uh-huh.
Do you have a point?
You know, you think I would.
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
And that doesn't scare you?
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
So have you called her yet?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
Yeah.
This couch belongs to us.
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Are you okay?
What?
Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
I'm back.
So, are we gonna get together or what?
Great, I'll see you then.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Wish me luck.
Good luck!
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
What? That's like insanely easy!
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Hey!
How do you feel?
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
And protected them from a tornado?
Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
That was me.
Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Any luck?
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
How's my Bing-a-ling?
Why are your eyes so white?
You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary.
You're all invited to bite me!
He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father.
That's me.
Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Hey!
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Oh, how'd that happen?
Because I'm cooler.
You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Hey.
Hey!
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
They're all tourists.
Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Good choice.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
What kinda change?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
What are you doing?
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Why?
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Hi.
Oh, that's attractive.
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Oh, ah- the kid has it.
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Why?!
That game should not be played without my supervision.
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it.
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
You mean like for award shows?
Some of them.
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Okay, who wore those?
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
I so am.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Well, this all looks good.
Great.
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
No, we never do that
Okay, here comes another camera.
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
Me too!
April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Of!
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
No, Janice.
Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
Hmm, how about my azzz?
Hey, this is hollow.
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
That's what you should say.
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Afraid to ask him?
Could not be more terrified.
Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
What?!
I suppose mainly sexual.
...Hm.
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Oh God, no.
Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Really?
...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Yeah, but don't you think....
Yeah, okay.
All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Mmm.
I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
I'll help you dial.
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Bye bye Joey.
What a phony.
Sir.
Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
What's this?
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Me! On my computer.
Well you sure used a large font.
Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Something else I might have said?
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Keep talking.
I love you!
Bonjour, monsieur.
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
So, how was the party?
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
What?
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Name one!
What happened?!!
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
Really!
You know what I like most about him, though?
What?
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Oh God, no.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
More turkey Mr. Chandler?
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Okay, Santa!
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
Why not?
Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Know what I mean?
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
Let's do it!
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
He paid a lot of money for it.
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
And that's funny, why?
Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it.
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Really?
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Are you kidding?!
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
I warned you...
Who is being loud?
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Hey! How was it?
Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
If only he were a woman.
Yeah.
Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Hey. Where's Joey?
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Her what?
Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
So, Chandler, who's on your list?
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Can I help you?
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
How did he do this?
Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
What do we use to split it?
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
All right, I'll pick that one.
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
Hey!
Hey! You ready to go?
What?
I love you.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
How do you know that? How?
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Uh-hmm.
Oh my God! I love that!
Really?!
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
What did you do when they found out?
Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
We should?
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
We stand firm at $10.
How would you like to pay?
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
Heyyyy-What?
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
I think I'm gonna cry!
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
You guys!! Come on!
What do you mean?
Hey.
Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
But you're not anymore!
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
What gave me away?
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
No.
Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Thanks a lot.
No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Hey.
Hey.
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Come on man, really how old?!
Wow thanks!
Joe?
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
What?
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
What?
Cupping.
Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
You still on that?
You are way off, pal.
No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
That's a good story, Grandpa.
Hey
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Absolutely!
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
No, 10 is the highest.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
Yuh-huh.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
No.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Shes still here.
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
Youre kidding? She seems so...
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Then what?
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
And everybody knows this?
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Uh, Ross.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
Hi Ben!
Auntie Monica!!
I think they're very nice.
I like 'em.
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Awww. But still no.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
Oh! Wow! Hey!
Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.
That's all right, that's well, I figured....
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Hey Pheebs!
Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Yeah right.
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Yes!
Yeah, he likes porn.
Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Hi, Nina. Come on in.
You wanted to see me?
Which is bad, because?
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Me?! Why me?
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
That is so sweet!
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
No! Why does he have to go?
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
I'll take her back tomorrow.
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
Oh?
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
What?
The ring is gone!
Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
You slept with the stripper?
Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I...
Yeah-no, just that last song.
Hello.
Hello.
Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
Hey!
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
No.
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
So, that's it?
So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
Mi-mi-mii.
I've never wanted you more.
Hello.
Hey.
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
You'll get one.
Oh yeah? When?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Hey...
NOW!!!!!!!!
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
Huh.
C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
What are you doing?
I have no idea.
Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Bumpy?
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Since when?
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
And everybody knows this?
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
Absolutely.
How come it's not mixing with the water?
Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
Ok.
No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Are you travelling with a child?
Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Noo!!!
Yes!
I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Please?
I wanted to go to the strip club!
Yeah, all right.
Hey!
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Ah, yeah!
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
This is the most special day of our lives.
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility..." Full responsibility! "...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"
No?
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
He should take the sack?
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
Aww. Ohh!
Put your hands together.
Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Really?
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
Keep talking.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
Hey!
Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Well all right, one thing happened?
Well I'm sorry.
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
No, it's-it's Andrew.
He's... new.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Ross is Batman!
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Batman has a utility belt!
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
You bug me.
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
You didn't just break up.
This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
Aaaaahhh!!
There you go!
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
Its Phoebe! Hi!
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Yeah, sure.
Someone in there?
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
You win.
Well, what did you have?
Uh, wow, 700.
Not 700 exactly?
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
What is the matter with you ?!?
What?
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
You're turning into a women.
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
So is Joey around?
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!
Hey!
Hey!
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Well, I do.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Ok.
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
Hey, hey, look at that talent.
Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Hey, you know about that?!
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
What?!
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
Honey, we gotta go!
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
Yes, include more people in this.
I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
Oh my God, is it really that bad?
Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
What's the matter with him?
I think he's stoned again.
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
No not Candy Lady.
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
Thank you.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
DANGER!!!!!
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Sure! Okay, you go first.
Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
Break!
I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
Let go! Let go!
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
I could be a secretary.
I could do that.
What are you playing with?
Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
Yeah, me too.
I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
Hey! You can't go back there!
Oh my God.
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
I will have one.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Of course, sir.
Okay.
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
What, now?
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
How's it going?
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
I know! I know!
Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!
Really?
Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
What did you just say?
ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Noo.
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Chandler, what were you thinking?
Chandler?
Yeah!
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
I am so glad you said cooks.
I know.
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
And of course, crotchless panties.
Aw, I love that.
You guys!
You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Work people? Nobody told me.
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
You think I should?
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
Where's Buddy?
Buddy?
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
It's work.
And we don't work hard?
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
What do you mean?
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Oh!
I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Just, just say what you feel.
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
You realize what you are don't you?
What?
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?
You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
You're straight. I get it.
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
Why not?!
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?
I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.
Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
I could be a secretary.
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
Oh, you just know.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
So was it a lot more money?
... the WENUS?
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
All right.
And could I get my ring back?
Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Off?!!
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Oh yeah, come here.
Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
I had the same dream!
Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride.
Wow! Yeah!
Oh-oh!
Great!
Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. Thanks Joey.
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Who needs a lease when it's family!
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Yeah.
You got it.
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
You said no right?!
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Keep talking.
Really?
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Betrothed...
...betrothed couple.
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Yeah.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Oh-I don't know.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
And they weren't looking at you before?!
Hi.
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
Hey. Watcha guys doin?
Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Well, there you go.
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
Look, what do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you like her!
Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Whoa! You had sex today?
Wow.
Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
I can't kiss anyone.
Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Thank you.
Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
Chandler! Is he?
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
I understand that would be difficult.
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
It's him, not it!
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
When did I try to give you money?
Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
Are you serious?
I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Dad?
I'm here!
Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Your different here too. Your mean in England.
What the hell!!!
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Okay!
This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket...
Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Were you the ones called the cops?!
Why not?
Because we hate them.
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
It's my joke.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Let's go watch it at your place.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
What?
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Quick volleyball question.
Volleyball.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Which one?
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!
That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
That's very funny. We done now?
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
Alright, whadyou do with him?
You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
That oughta do it.
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
What picture?
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Kristen Lang.
Bye!
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
I was not flirting.
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Yeah, right.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Ah, the stalker.
Never mind, it's open.
Let's get out of here.
The one time they're not home.
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Is Brian...?
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
No, just give me another minute.
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
You thought about that?
Yeah.
And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
Dysprosium.
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
What?
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards.
Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Old?
The young hot ball and chain.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
There's no back to this couch!
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
No.
Nooooo.
Uh-huh, yeah.
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
No!
Chandler!
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
Oh my.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
That's what you say at the end of a date.
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Yeah, so?
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
I really wish that you wouldn't.
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Pheebs!!
Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Hey!
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Ow!
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Again true.
And this goes for all guys?
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
Thats unbelievable.
I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Right here!
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Ohh.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Yeah, it's good.
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
What are you guys gonna do?
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
Well, how much do you think he needs?
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Well that would help the pride thing.
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
Ohh!
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
A part of him did yes.
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Hey, hey, they're runnin'
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
It isn't?
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
Hey!
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Really?
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Who was that?
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Yeah!
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Do you know anything about women?
No.
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Whoa!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Good luck!
That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
What?!!
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.

You betcha!
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Emotional Knapsack?
Yeah.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
Dude, don't do that too me!
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
Sounds great.
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
You can say that because she's not your mom.
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Really?
Well, not anymore.
But we don't do that.
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
I can't believe this.
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
Rhythm?
It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?
Rough numbers?
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Yeah I guess you're right.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Hey.
Hey, Pheebs.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Okay.
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Monica...
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
I don't want to say.
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Oh crap!
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Really?
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Water! Water! Water!
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
Ewwww!!
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
"...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm." Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away.
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Do you have any respect for your body?
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
She answered.
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Hey! Hi!
How'd he take it?
No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Noo.
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
Men are unbelievable.
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
Ankle.
We'll see.
I Gotcha!!
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
That had to hurt!
There you go!
You're definitely scaring here.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Yeah, me too.
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Okay.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Hi, Ross.
Hey.
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
An egg?
Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Excuse me. How ya doin'?
So, do we have the best friends or what?
I will go for that drink.
You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Hey!
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
What's wrong with being the Bings?
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
No.
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
What did you say?
Oh, you just know.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
8!:
Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!
Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.
Yes, you said that.
Chandler?
Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Hi Chandler!
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
Wh-what?
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Phoebs, play with meeee.
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
Uhh, no-no thanks.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
What?
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
Okay, here is the phone bill.
Oh my God!!
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
It's not charity, Joe...
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
Chandler!
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
No, there were two.
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
...I dunno.
You don't know?!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
Oh, you didn't have to do this.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
What?
Eldad, this is Rachel.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
Y'miss it?
Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
Oh my God!
What?
Nooo!!
Yes!!
Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Oh?
Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
Okay.
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
What?
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
What are you doing?
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
It is???
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right.
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.
Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
Hey!
Pheebs!!
Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
Well I like both eggs equally.
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
I just saw Janice.
Oh.
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Really?!
Sure! Where are the seats?
Wherever! I've got like 20!
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
We can't do this.
No! Oyster?
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
I do like that.
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Cheers!
Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship...
Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Do I dare ask?
That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
Yeah, all right, I'll play.
All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
And the sex?
Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
Is that all?
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
It's actually going to be just family.
Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Yeah.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Okay, this one I like!
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
Who jumps at loud noises!
Wow! I could've died tonight.
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Oh my God!
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
"Take good care of your Momma son."
Cut!!!!!!!!!!
Hello?
Hello, is Ross there?
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Okay.
Give me the good stuff.
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Ok, they're coming, shhh.
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Oh my God.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
True story!
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
And thank you, for that.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Are you alright?
My God, you're choking! That better?
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
Yeah!
I like them a lot.
Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
Oh come on!!
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Even with me?
Really?
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
In the game room!
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
No!
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
Paris?
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
No.
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
Yeah!
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk.
Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Oh, howd she take it?
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
I had them made special.
That's fine.
It is?
Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Okay.
No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Oh yeah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
It's okay, I got a plan.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Ohh!
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Hi!
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
What happened to Janine?
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Wouldn't you be?
Really?
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
What?!
Glass, sand, whatever.
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
You really think that'll work?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Okay, good luck with that.
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Whose little ball of paper is this?!
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
In the game room!
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Did I put too much rum in here?
Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Good-bye muscles!!
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Uh-oh, it was bad?
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
It hurts my teeth.
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
1250.
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
What's in the bag?
I do!
Okay.
Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Come on! Chandler!
They really were pretty, weren't they?
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
Right.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
That's okay.
And I'm cute too.
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
We are switching back, right now!
No, we're not! We're not leaving!
I don't know.
What?
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
Him? Him, Ross?
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
Absolutely, yeah!
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
Let's do it!
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
Phoebe!
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Well this one's for you.
Get out.
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
That's what they'll call us.
So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
What's going on?
What is it?
That's great!
So.... I quit.
Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
You seen Sandy?
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
What?
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Hey, I've been honing!
What was with the dishes?
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
Hey.
Oh. Sorry!
Me too.
Yeah?
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Yeah, you wish!
Yeah, okay. Alright.
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
How do you know that? How?
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Yeah, I understand.
All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
We have got to move!
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
Hi!
Hey.
Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
All right.
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
I didn't think I was!
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
No, I will not!
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
It's happened to you?
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Absolutely.
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Hey.
Hey.
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Seven times!
Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Chicken? Chicken boy!
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
Mark's a genius!
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
What am I going to do?
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
That's fine!
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
Would you please get some rest!
No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
What am I going to do?
I don't know you guys.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Cigarettes?!!
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Okay that does sound like fun.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
You don't have a car. And your license expired.
I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Is Joey here?
Wouldn't you be?
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Yeah I guess you're right.
I'm gonna do it.
All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
We're not gonna lose to girls.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Okay!
Okay!
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
No thank you.
Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Oh God, yeah.
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
Hey.
Hey!
I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
It's this way? Sorry.
All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.
I can't believe it.
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
Whoa!
What?
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Well, there you go.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
I did pay for half of it.
Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Way to be strong, man!
Hey!
Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Hmph.
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
What are you doing?!
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
Um, is it sugarless?
Sorry, it's not.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
OK, here goes.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and
It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!
Never!
Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Ohhh, here it comes.
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
Really?!
Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
No, I ah, I didn't do them.
Oh, you forgot?
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
Doug!!
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Phoebe is, making people.
Everybody's doing stuff!
We could climb Mt. Everest!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
You do?!
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
What did you say?
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Keep going.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.
Shes still here.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Youre kidding? She seems so...
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Okay, I freaked out a little.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Yes.
I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
So what's going on with you?
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
So the light went out in my refrigerator...
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Dysprosium.
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Hey, here she comes.
Hey.
Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
Come on, don't do this.
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
That is so funny. Let me see that.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
All right, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.
Oh my god.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Ohhh!
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Ross, sweetheart!
Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
It's not that bad.
Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
No, I'm still married.
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
I do not have baby fever!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
That's him.
Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
Alright. "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."
Come on.
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
Are you sure this time?
Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's.
There is no alley behind Macy's.
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Okay sure!
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
So what. I say, punch him.
Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
What?
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
I'm crying here!!
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
Wow!
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Hey, the fight's starting!
Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Fight's over!
Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
It's not that bad.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
I got something for her. It's a book!
A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
See, I would never snap at you like that.
Continue.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
I'm not arguing with that.
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
What do ya say? What do ya say?
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Are you serious?
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Hey.
Sure, neighbor come on in.
So, is Janine around?
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
Yeah.
Cool.
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Games and stuff.
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
What are you doing?
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Right here!
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Okay.
No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Well, if you think it will help.
You should! How is she?
Ohhh!!
I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
What?
I don't want to move again!
All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
That's what you say at the end of a date.
You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
Well, they always called.
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Hey!
What are you up too?
Yeah, Big Brother.
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
So have you called her yet?
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?
Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Yeah! She's right in there!
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
Hi, oh hi.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Really? I've heard better.
I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!
Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Youre kidding? She seems so...
Thats unbelievable.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Well yeah.
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
It doesn't say that in the script.
It does in mine!
You bug me.
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
You probably want us to move in together?
It doesn't scare me!
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
How about receiving?
Yes!
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
No, not us... Us!
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
You got all that from the back of her head?
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
I don't know.
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Great!
Now, have you told anyone else?
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
You know what the. . .
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
Hey guys.
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
What?!
Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
Did that!
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
Bye. I can't stand the woman!
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
But...
Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
How is that the silver lining?
You have to really wanna see it.
No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Oh!!
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
Happy for you.
No, happy for you!
I-I wanna be with her, I like her.
Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Chandler?
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Why?
She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
Listen to me!!
Juice, I need...
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
Scared? Happy?
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
I know! I can't wait!
Were you're parents happy, or something?
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Well what happened at dinner?
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
What?
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
We've got a box.
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Phoebe, woo!
Okay, woo! Hi.
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Mine!
Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
Hey.
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
Hey!
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
Chandler.
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.
It's not that bad.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
What?!
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
You promised you would break up with her!
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
My God! What happened to you?
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
What?!
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
Hello darlings.
Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Yeah, you wish!
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Well, it involved Monica.
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
What was the dream about?
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Why would I be mad?
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
Okay.
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
What?
Let me see that! Oh man!
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Yeah, where the hell is he?
How's this?
Eeeee!
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Chandler, Chandler.
Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
I think she's OK.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
No way!
It's true.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Monica? You're Mom.
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."
Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Hey!
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Guys?
Over here.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
What?! Ow!
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
He took my joke, he took it.
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
That's a good idea.
Yeah!
Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now...
Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Well what is it?!
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
How? How is your fault?
Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break...
You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
Huh?
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Sorry Phoebe.
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad.
No, no, ACC-cept that.
Oh.
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
How sad are we?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Okay, get out of my kitchen!
All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
Right.
Hi.
Hello.
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Oh.
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
Sure!
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
No.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
Oh My God.
C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
You're right, you're right, it is.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
No.
You really think so?
Yeah. I really do.
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
I can't believe this Chandler!
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
Ah-ha!
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
No, we only went out once.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
I don't know you guys.
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
Let go! Let go!
Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
Ow!!
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
....Are we still talking about sex?
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Oh, right, right, shut up.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
Here.
The receipt.
I don't know.
Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
It's a pretty cool tux.
We should really learn how to play the real way.
I like our way. Oh! Chess!
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Wait, we can't do this.
Why?
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Really?
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Yeah?
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
What's this?
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
What, what is that?
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
Hi!
Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
It doesn't scare me!
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...
Honey, this will help.
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Ohh, so?
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Hey!
Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
See, now it's weird again.
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Okay!
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Saw your head. Saw your head.
What is it?
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
The balloon?
I can't, I gotta go.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
Oh yay!
Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
Hey-hey!
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Can't we just use a pen?
No, Amish boy.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Really?
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Because it's too delicious.
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Oh, I'm sorry what?
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Really?
No freakshow, she's fictional.
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Will you get us better gifts?
Fine!
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Oh John! Great!
Here he is.
Wow! I would trade.
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
You're actually going through with this?
You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
Really?!
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
Yeah!
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
Ohh...
That sounds perfect!
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
That game should not be played without my supervision.
What's in the bag?
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
What?! Anything! Anything!
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
God, he's good.
If only he were a woman.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Yeah?
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
No.
Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.
Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
You're a little high maintenance.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
I'm off the list.
She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
I talked to Janice.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
What do you mean?
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
So why don't you quit?
Who is Maria?
Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.
What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Yes, and grumpy.
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
I love you too.
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
What?!
Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
That's easy, baggage claim.
Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
Oh.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
Hi.
Hi.
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Really?
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh my God. He threw up?
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
No.
Then you are neither of your parents!
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
Oh my God.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
You OK?
No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.
Oh.
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Who said anything about Christmas?
Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Uh-huh.
Morning.
Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
Oh, that's too bad.
I'll survive.
What if we have to pee?
I'll cancel the sodas.
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Why, nobody good?
So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'
So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Hey, this is so unfair!
Oh, why is it unfair?
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Well, I-I could live without it.
I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
She is now.
What are you saying?
How? How is your fault?
Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off.
Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
Really?
Chandler!
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Oh! Oh!
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
Ohhhhh!
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Five more and I'll flash you.
One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
You said...
Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials...
Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
Ohh.
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
You know what the. . .
I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . .
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
You were gonna propose?
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Have you been here all night?
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
We want candy! We want candy now!
Candy Lady?
No not Candy Lady.
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
You must stop!
That only took me an hour.
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
What?
Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
Yeah, o-okay.
I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
That's a good idea for a business!
That-that is a good trick.
All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
Thank you.
That's fine.
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
I'll take that.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
Okay.
Wow!
Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
I can't do that.
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Ohhh, yeah, me too.
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Come on Joey!!!
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
Chandler?
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
I do.
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Oh my God.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Yes.
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Really?
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Do you?
Don't you have to pee?
'S'why I'm dancing...
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Oh my God.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Yes.
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
What? Why, why would...
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
We have good news, look whose back!
Hi!
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
Oh, no...
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Light still out?
Yeah.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
What else did you think about?
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Sure you do.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
I think you're better than you think you are.
Really? Okay, so...
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
Am I naked again?!
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
I am pretending.
Well then, do it better!
Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
Bye, Pheebs.
Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
Down at the docks again?
Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Here's my binoculars.
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Uh huh. Why is that?
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Hey!
Please tell me you got the message!
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Yeah! Oh my God!
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
The bigger half.
That's so sweet.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
Again?
And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
Well?
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
